"My design depends on the piston diameter, what happens if you decrease it? ",Dependencies between design parameters
"Does increasing the flywheel thickness increase or decrease ""c""?",Dependencies between design parameters
That is what my document specifies. I will keep c low unless the piston needs it to be higher,Dependencies between design parameters
thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter,Dependencies between design parameters
"Does the flywheel shaft diameter ""ds"" affect any variables in your control?",Dependencies between design parameters
But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher,Effects of design parameters on objectives
Increasing the offset increases the mass and decreases the factor of safety.,Effects of design parameters on objectives
Whats the effect of D on your results?,Effects of design parameters on objectives
can increase diameter is we need higher fos,Effects of design parameters on objectives
"Lower D, lowers my mass and FOS",Effects of design parameters on objectives
whoever changed please go back,Effects of design parameters on objectives
the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass,Effects of design parameters on objectives
If that reduces your fos,Effects of design parameters on objectives
"no because it went down to fair, the mass went up a lot",Effects of design parameters on objectives
Have you changed the system at all? Our quality has dropped.,Effects of design parameters on objectives
is there a bore diameter you are set on? or are you still experimenting?,Exploration of design parameter values
I just got my mass down to 0.11,Exploration of design parameter values
I am getting around 2.26-2.95,Exploration of design parameter values
Make sure you dont drop too much mass though,Exploration of design parameter values
is that best case or worst case? my numbers are in the hundreds so we can play with ds if you use that,Exploration of design parameter values
do you think I should try and increase those?,Exploration of design parameter values
tf = 10 mm; ds = 25 mm;,Exploration of design parameter values
we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there,Exploration of design parameter values
we have excellent quality right now,Monitoring objective values
i think we have excellent quality right now,Monitoring objective values
Rn were under mass so if you need to you could increase it a bit,Monitoring objective values
Right now our factor of safety is chilling around 2.5,Monitoring objective values
I'm still seeing 'poor' on my end,Monitoring objective values
we're only trying to keep FOS over 2 right?,Monitoring objective values
what range of fos #s are you getting? mine are in the hundreds so it's not the limiting system,Monitoring objective values
"Yeah, that was nice",NAN
we're back to very good,NAN
back to very good,NAN
ya'' should chat about that,NAN
"alright, guess not then",NAN
okay,NAN
"alright, guess no then",NAN
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,NAN
Mine should be broadcasting,NAN

"any FOS higher than 2 gets us nothing more, we need to drop mass",Tradeoff between objectives
"If I reduce my mass by .03, it reduces FOS by .25 to 1.76",Tradeoff between objectives
I now have minimum fos but i further decreased my mass,Tradeoff between objectives
Can you cut any more mass out and get closer to FOS  = 2,Tradeoff between objectives
I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77,Selected design parameter values for objective(s)
for tf = 10 & ds = 25; m = 0.55 and FOS = 5625.56,Selected design parameter values for objective(s)
the current broadcast. FOS = 5626,Selected design parameter values for objective(s)
