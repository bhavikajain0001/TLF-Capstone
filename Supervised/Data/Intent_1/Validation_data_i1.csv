"My design depends on the piston diameter, what happens if you decrease it? ",Asking for information
"Does increasing the flywheel thickness increase or decrease ""c""?",Asking for information
That is what my document specifies. I will keep c low unless the piston needs it to be higher,Providing information
thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter,Providing information
"Does the flywheel shaft diameter ""ds"" affect any variables in your control?",Asking for information
But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher,Asking for information
Increasing the offset increases the mass and decreases the factor of safety.,Providing information
Whats the effect of D on your results?,Asking for information
can increase diameter is we need higher fos,Providing information
"Lower D, lowers my mass and FOS",Providing information
whoever changed please go back,Asking for information
the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass,Providing information
If that reduces your fos,Providing information
"no because it went down to fair, the mass went up a lot",Providing information
Have you changed the system at all? Our quality has dropped.,Asking for information
is there a bore diameter you are set on? or are you still experimenting?,Asking for information
I just got my mass down to 0.11,Providing information
I am getting around 2.26-2.95,Providing information
Make sure you dont drop too much mass though,Providing information
is that best case or worst case? my numbers are in the hundreds so we can play with ds if you use that,Asking for information
do you think I should try and increase those?,Asking for information
tf = 10 mm; ds = 25 mm;,Providing information
we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there,Providing information
we have excellent quality right now,Providing information
i think we have excellent quality right now,NAN
Rn were under mass so if you need to you could increase it a bit,Providing information
Right now our factor of safety is chilling around 2.5,Providing information
I'm still seeing 'poor' on my end,Providing information
we're only trying to keep FOS over 2 right?,Asking for information
what range of fos #s are you getting? mine are in the hundreds so it's not the limiting system,Asking for information
"Yeah, that was nice",NAN
we're back to very good,Providing information
back to very good,Providing information
ya'' should chat about that,Providing information
"alright, guess not then",NAN
okay,NAN
"alright, guess no then",NAN
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,Providing information
Mine should be broadcasting,NAN
27,NAN
"any FOS higher than 2 gets us nothing more, we need to drop mass",Providing information
"If I reduce my mass by .03, it reduces FOS by .25 to 1.76",Providing information
I now have minimum fos but i further decreased my mass,Providing information
Can you cut any more mass out and get closer to FOS  = 2,Asking for information
I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77,Providing information
for tf = 10 & ds = 25; m = 0.55 and FOS = 5625.56,Providing information
the current broadcast. FOS = 5626,Providing information
"tf = 10, ds = 25",Providing information
