fine_label utterance
OOS I see it
OOS mine still says fair
OOS cool. not touching anything
OOS yeah it does but all of the fos have been over 2 except one of them
OOS I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
OOS i am using 60 rn
OOS okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
OOS Someone picked an FS of 0.51
OOS do you depend on t1 or r1?
OOS I also have a second parameter that increases fos and mass if I increase that
OOS I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
OOS Have you made any progress on the piston diameter D?
OOS what is your current mass and fos?
OOS I have around 10
OOS 2.06
OOS reply when done
OOS lmk what you think
OOS I think the FOS shown is the lowest FOS of ours
OOS sounds good
OOS you should probably ask him/her
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS ok we are good
OOS Mine is 3.96
OOS OK STOP
OOS btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
OOS perfect
OOS my subsystem FOS is reporting in the thousands ?
OOS 0.11
OOS but were at v good
OOS crankshaft bearing offset
OOS Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
OOS yeah
OOS whats your mass at the moment
OOS The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by 0.03
OOS can you share all your variables
OOS depends
OOS yeah, leave yours in a safe config
OOS rn is very
OOS do you have any variable that seems to relate to them?
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS Oh no
OOS What is your mass? I can increase FOS but I can't decrease mass much more. its only .5
OOS i don't think either of those affect me
OOS Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
OOS okay
OOS trying to max fos and min weight
OOS m=0.07 FOS=1.23
OOS I think there is but I don't know how.
OOS does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
OOS alriight
OOS So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers?
OOS have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS FOS is back i increased thickness
OOS almost had ya
OOS What affects your mass the most?
OOS we had "good" at one point didnt we?
OOS What's your fos?
OOS Do you need any information from me?
OOS I have 3.03 with mass of 0.12.
OOS now mass is 1.18
OOS 1.31
OOS Try lowering your weight
OOS woah were at poor now
OOS Are you good with the results?
OOS I'll be on it
OOS what is your fos?
OOS We were at exceelent and now poor, did you change anything?
OOS The input crank-shaft bearing support offset
OOS it is yeah
OOS im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
OOS great - please leave it there
OOS My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
OOS mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft
OOS need: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS what are your weight and fos values
OOS No i do not!
OOS it still doesnt
OOS No, it should still be at 40mm
OOS m = 0.16, fos = 4.66
OOS yea it is
OOS also decreases my fos
OOS i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
OOS negative
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS stop changing
OOS totally unsure what 4 simulations you mean
OOS and we've reached the global requirements
OOS Awesome
OOS ok back to very good i say leabe it
OOS what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
OOS my mass is less than 2, who has the biggest contribution?
OOS 9193
OOS i havent changed anything
OOS how much weight can you trim (generally)
OOS it doesnt have to be that high
OOS hmm
OOS mine is currently m=0.02 and FOS=0.22 but my max FOS is 0.24
OOS Are you changing youre values?
OOS So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
OOS thickness is 10
OOS so I'm thinking the FOS of the system is the lowest FOS of any individual subsystem, can you try to increase FOS?
OOS Where is your FOS at?
OOS yeah
OOS oh okay.
OOS no i do not
OOS let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS okay nice
OOS ?
OOS Hello, what variables do you have control over?
OOS let me know what you think crank bearing offset (c) will be
OOS yeah
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS it doesnt matter if youre not the min FOS
OOS what's the diameter you're using?
OOS from when it was at excellent
OOS *?
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS I do not believe so
OOS FOS just went down
OOS m= 3.46 fos=0.3
OOS group: i changed my part!
OOS So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
OOS yep raised it
OOS Maybe not
OOS group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
OOS Is it good to be maximized or minimized?
OOS Don't change anything!
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS can you raise fos still?
OOS oof
OOS Keeping it 45!
OOS ive got a FOS of 3.91, lets see if we can get it further above 2
OOS crankshaft bearing offset
OOS Ok
OOS Our FOS just dropped a ton
OOS increases
OOS yes, an old version, I'm running the simulations you requested noe
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset (c)
OOS let shoot for smaller then
OOS Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction!
OOS what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
OOS Please let me know if you change the piston bore diameter
OOS sure give me a second
OOS changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
OOS hello
OOS If I increase flywheel the thickness, and diameter, the mass increases, but the FOS decreases.
OOS I know its weird
OOS gave me dimensions earlier
OOS My part only accounts for only 0.1 so I can't do much for mass
OOS it's my best option
OOS Hello, what is the piston bore diameter?
OOS how do we submit?
OOS What are you working on?
OOS It's the smae tradeoff for everyone
OOS we got it!
OOS Do u depend on the bore diameter?
OOS to give the same factor of saftey and reduced weight
OOS Yeah one sec
OOS okay nice
OOS leave yours as is for now, piston is biggest factor rn
OOS what values work best for you
OOS The FOS is 2.03, so there are no improvements available
OOS okay perfect
OOS What values do you need?
OOS yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel
OOS Idon't have that information, but check the front page of your packet
OOS is there any way you can increase fos
OOS man 0.09 fos lol
OOS if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an FOS of over 2 that chould do it
OOS Working with you and piston as well
OOS so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
OOS ok we're close
OOS I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS have you figure out how D effects ur numbers
OOS if you increase the diameter, the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease
OOS what diameter are you using
OOS No, do you need anything from me?
OOS i see that
OOS currenty 2.03, but that can be raised.
OOS Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
OOS yes
OOS hmmm okay
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS nice nice
OOS whats your FOS if you dropped mass by 3kg
OOS i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
OOS it is the smallest it can be
OOS alright yeah, I'm at lowest possible mass (0.1) and fos is 2.77
OOS yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good
OOS 0.28
OOS we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
OOS fair, that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase FOS, I'll decrease mass
OOS can you change it to 150?
OOS i did try it a few minutes ago, did anythjing change? Ill try it again
OOS minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail
OOS no
OOS who changed
OOS That's alright, as long as we have a FOS above 2
OOS still 45
OOS Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
OOS quality looks very good so idk?
OOS what variables are you considering?
OOS yeah i cant change anything. We done?
OOS Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
OOS my projected outputs changed now im at m 1.14 and fos1.32
OOS I have a high FOS for everywhere in my combination of ranges
OOS trying to max fos and min weight
OOS flywheel boi is tryna improve
OOS c was changed to 80
OOS or crankshaft
OOS Do you need dc?
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS :)
OOS ?
OOS hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
OOS but you might have to reduce mass
OOS no have not plugged in any new values
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS then it was not me
OOS same lmao
OOS who is this?!
OOS Alright, thank you!
OOS Can you do 20?
OOS group-save current values as backup 2
OOS Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
OOS sweeeeeet
OOS Mine is at 2.05
OOS 2.95 is my minimum, I can't go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
OOS Our FOS dipped again
OOS if i can increase diameter and thickness in a similar ratio, both mass and fos increase
OOS acceptable weight now
OOS Im at 12 60 now.
OOS like a higher c
OOS Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
OOS I had an excellent quality, but with someone's new broadcast, it's not poor
OOS The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
OOS Keep your FOS above 2
OOS no I do not think it does, I was able to get my FOS up above 3.4 though
OOS Cool
OOS 2.26 and 2.5
OOS but ive decided im gonna focus more on 352 bc its a heavier weighted class
OOS Yeah still at 40 just made thickness smaller
OOS Hey whats the Fs for your subsystem?
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS Ok. We need to try to decrease mass
OOS im at 75
OOS we did hit both requirements at one point
OOS ranges from0.45 to 4.43
OOS yea and increase FOS
OOS ok
OOS My current fos is 5625.56
OOS Try to lower it to 2
OOS I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the fos
OOS mass?
OOS Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS > 2?
OOS under variables of other subsystems
OOS when D is max
OOS 2.01
OOS Our factor of safety is greater than 2, which is excellent 
OOS we are at very good again as of 12;53
OOS Ok. I just updated my settings to be m=0.02 and FOS=0.22
OOS mas- 1.23 fos- 12.2k
OOS some one got good quality what where your variables in that
OOS what's your fos right now with 70mm diameter?
OOS same here, any small decrease in mass lowers FOS by a lot for me
OOS hahaha
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS did it.  need to drop mass more
OOS and FOS?
OOS ok, increasing the diameter will decrease my mass and my factory of safety
OOS yep just did it
OOS Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
OOS though I might switch to 75
OOS on the projector
OOS what is the thickness you have on that right now with a d=15?
OOS My max is only 0.24 but I can increase it to 0.22 while only adding 0.01 mass
OOS got it
OOS but D has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve FOS
OOS my current value is c = 150 and dc = 45
OOS Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
OOS Only way to get higher fos at 1.32 is to raise weight to 1.14
OOS yeah working on it now
OOS very good
OOS What is your mass?
OOS and how so?
OOS Yeah everything is going down now. Not sure why. I haven't chantged anything for like 10 mins.
OOS just barely above 2
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS Each part should be at 2
OOS I'll try it
OOS I don't think so
OOS good job!
OOS what are your design variables?
OOS Yea, just a slight chance to fail
OOS Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
OOS What are your current parameters?
OOS i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
OOS The bore diameter as of right now is 55 I believe
OOS just kidding, back to poor. 
OOS yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
OOS my fos is 0.24
OOS is your fos still 5000 ish?
OOS I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
OOS Ok I was at bearing support offset of 150 and crank-pin diameter of 43.8
OOS 82.5 is good
OOS no I don't need either
OOS It's getting better, keep it up
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
OOS idk if it helps mass though. does it?
OOS I have lowest mass output selected currently
OOS I think you need to reduce the mass a bit
OOS nice work!
OOS Try for a FOS of 2 with minimum mass
OOS its the current broadcast..
OOS no, i mean 6.72
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS whats the name of the diameter?
OOS can you share your equations?
OOS i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
OOS Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
OOS indeed
OOS I didn;t change
OOS or does it at all
OOS for my parts
OOS so you dont need anything fom me right?
OOS Fair!
OOS hahah this is rough
OOS What's your FOS given the crankshaft bearing offset that the crankshaft has?
OOS nobody change anythibn
OOS i brought it down
OOS the program won't let me go any lower
OOS My individual mass is 1.27
OOS Have you changed your values any?
OOS ive got you at 75
OOS we need to lower our mass
OOS is diameter 90
OOS What is your third field you fill out to run simulations
OOS should we end?
OOS Ok. I now have FOS options over 1
OOS looks like we both need bore diameter from piston
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS now it's back ?? idk
OOS does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
OOS I think so
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS the new design looks real good
OOS trying to max fos and min weight
OOS cool. not touching anything
OOS What parameters can you change
OOS I think it's all coming from crankshaft. He doesnt seem to know whats going on
OOS No idea
OOS seems to be helping
OOS we are 1.94 over mass rn
OOS we need FOS up a bit more now overall
OOS No
OOS thanks!
OOS yea my bad, I've got 7.15kg right now
OOS I think smaller
OOS Im going to reduce piston D to 75 to see what happens
OOS Not sure yet.
OOS I got a little better mass results
OOS If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
OOS That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
OOS I have my best broadcast for the available thing
OOS Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
OOS are we content with very good?
OOS whats the lowest/highest mass and fos for you
OOS No, my FOS values are all greater than 300.
OOS 150 is lowest right?
OOS Sounds great to me
OOS Looks like moving from 90 up to 105 doesn't benefit me much in terms of the FoS/mass ratio
OOS a little someone else is messing around with their fos
OOS Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft
OOS Also I think a tf value of 10 is best
OOS What does it look like for you?
OOS I am having it at 40
OOS I'm pretty sure I will leave the thickness at 10 mm
OOS I think we are done
OOS I'll ask them
OOS My apologies, Plots were not showing up for me originally.  I'm on it
OOS good job team
OOS what value did you decide on? nothing updated on my screen
OOS Diameter = 40mm
OOS yes.  i think so
OOS yes
OOS ok i did
OOS TRUE
OOS Yeah, that's not on me.
OOS ok my m is .53 and fos is 1929
OOS Every 10 D I decrease from 70, mass decrease like 0.2-0.3
OOS Also, what is optimal in terms of parameters for you?
OOS Ok
OOS fllywheel says their mass is 12708?
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS we can try smaller mass
OOS same
OOS how much mass is your part?
OOS yeap
OOS nothing actually
OOS What levels of mass are you dealing with?
OOS mine shows poor
OOS My fs is 2.27 and mass is 19.96
OOS Actually, that doesn't make any sense, since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is 150mm, and your maximum flywheel thickness is 51
OOS I am trying to change the piston thickness to reduce mass too
OOS nah dont do that
OOS me either
OOS I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
OOS seems like lower was working better
OOS record your current value
OOS yeah, what is fos?
OOS I've been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing D, but I haven't gotten any response.
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS decreasing mass is gonna decrease my fos
OOS 2.36
OOS you too!
OOS Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
OOS was it D=75 that was giving us that low weight?
OOS yes, i design the c and dc
OOS actually we should be getting excellent
OOS .06 and 2.63
OOS GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
OOS ah, change it back to 80 then?
OOS k, maybe not then
OOS lets try that
OOS The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
OOS Do you need any parameters from me ?
OOS im at c is 90
OOS I'll try
OOS Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS above 2?
OOS Let's try to get all the other engineers to work on high FS even if masses are high
OOS is your current value exactly 90?
OOS it is best for me
OOS thickness 12 diameter 60
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS go back to what you had we were at good
OOS Thanks
OOS oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by 0.25
OOS currently 50
OOS So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea
OOS dont do that
OOS i gotchu
OOS Because everyone else is min mass
OOS Because they asked me for that
OOS I chose 40mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it's good for him or her if I use maximum value
OOS ms was 2.79
OOS if you increase though that increases mass
OOS by about .7 or 1
OOS total
OOS someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
OOS alright
OOS I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
OOS ok
OOS Who changed it
OOS Yeah its down to like .67 now
OOS Anyway you can reduce mass slightly
OOS yeah idk what
OOS we have excellent
OOS it's not set to the lowest atm
OOS good
OOS My FS is around 2. Some parts may just have different ranges
OOS What variables do you have listed under Key Design Variables? I have (D), (c), (tf), and (ds)
OOS increasing D increases my fos
OOS yeah...
OOS we finished now?
OOS Who is this?
OOS try not to change anything until you talk to someone
OOS anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the FOS too much?
OOS something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
OOS I have lowest mass output selected currently
OOS its 3.24
OOS hey i think that made things better!
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS ok mine are c and dc will look into those
OOS with a FOS of 2.31
OOS 18.63 and fos = 2.06
OOS wait what did you change?
OOS yes
OOS Did you just change something?
OOS but then
OOS can you try decreasing your mass?
OOS What is ds?
OOS weight is 0.86
OOS Not for a little bit. did something change for you?
OOS Mass is now 0.1
OOS does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
OOS im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
OOS then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and FOS
OOS More than 2 is excellent
OOS yeah i think she'll maybe even drop some hints about the exam..
OOS What's a good working piston bore diameter?
OOS _I_I_
OOS ah, so when we broadcast we can overwrite
OOS what is your ms?
OOS ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
OOS Ok, that's odd
OOS Ok. I can now get FOS of over 3 for .12 kg so it works well for me but if you need to change it I can try other settings
OOS what's your max mass?
OOS i can go lower but it'ss reduce fos
OOS Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
OOS I've been talking with flywheel and he has very high mass ranges
OOS okay thats the most mass by far
OOS Ok
OOS Lets not change it
OOS changed piston back to 40 mm
OOS it just became 0.13 though
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS 2 is for expecially good design
OOS But it's back to poor now again
OOS My current FOS is 7.69, what is yours?
OOS Trying to figure out what caused the spike in weight
OOS how much does the mass increase?
OOS You good to leave
OOS m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
OOS what diameter have you chosen?
OOS what you need and what you have
OOS and what are your numbers when you do that
OOS I can, my lowest mass with the 45 bore diameter is 0.11, fos for that is 2.95
OOS Bcause it changes other peoples FS properties
OOS Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
OOS nah its above 35
OOS yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
OOS flywheel is 0.52 currently
OOS i asked
OOS so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
OOS Hello
OOS What do you currently have for your bore diameter?
OOS Who changed it
OOS yeah haha
OOS what is yours?
OOS that wasnt me
OOS hello
OOS i have a fos of 2.47
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia, 
OOS is our global FS just the lowest part FS?
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
OOS cool thats good
OOS what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
OOS (piston head)
OOS OK STOP
OOS ok still at 60
OOS cats game
OOS as long fos isnt below 2 keep it
OOS are the other people responding
OOS Hey, let me know if you need anything from me
OOS my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
OOS okay
OOS makes it way worse
OOS only .7 away now
OOS smallest
OOS can we submit now?
OOS How is the factor of safety
OOS what is your current mass and fos?
OOS refresh it
OOS now it dropped
OOS my mass is minimized rn
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS yeah i have no clue
OOS nope
OOS do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
OOS What info do you have?
OOS Gott an idea for the piston bore diameter?
OOS TRUE
OOS okay okay
OOS same and im currently there
OOS see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
OOS Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
OOS sounds good
OOS What's your FOS right now?
OOS How much does your part weigh?
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS true. what's your mass?
OOS do you need anything from me?
OOS 0.05 kg
OOS higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
OOS Does a larger thickness negatively affect fos or mass?
OOS woof woof
OOS are you changing things rn
OOS What are you working on?
OOS nice work!
OOS Sure.
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
OOS ms: 1.71, fos: 4.55
OOS ok good. I would just assume your part has the most mass
OOS yep okay
OOS meant decrease thickness and lower the weight
OOS I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
OOS what mass are you getting?
OOS goal weight is actually 35
OOS sorry i wrote backwards, increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
OOS piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
OOS Thanks. What's your FOS?
OOS Wait we've gone down to poor quality now
OOS do you have the piston bore diameter
OOS If that reduces your fos
OOS I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it?
OOS cool
OOS ok
OOS George?
OOS hey
OOS because it just skyrocketed
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott
OOS Hold where you are
OOS I think if you minimize the mass, we can work together to get a good factor of safety
OOS what mass are you getting?
OOS I think my d_c makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
OOS that cant be right
OOS our weight is too high
OOS My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
OOS yes
OOS Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
OOS m=3.48
OOS 27.44
OOS whats ur fos
OOS ah okk
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS yes. d from 20 to 15
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS Smallest number possible is best
OOS to do that should I lower r, which could lower our FOS too much
OOS no
OOS So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
OOS something happened to FOS
OOS gg
OOS (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
OOS lets do 62.5
OOS D = 85, M = 6.72
OOS i  believe at least one member's part is too heavy
OOS _I_I_
OOS Good
OOS I'm not sure any of your variables affect the piston pin?
OOS wassup
OOS Okay, I'll play around with it
OOS i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
OOS lol
OOS I have not touched mine
OOS what is your flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS okay cool everyone responded
OOS so what might effect you is the diameter of the pin
OOS GOOD***
OOS group-flywheel now
OOS i updated
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS right now at 88 shows very good
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS ok
OOS The crankshaft changed something
OOS What weight are you at?
OOS Yo
OOS changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS gotcha
OOS are those variables L and r?
OOS piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
OOS We need just a hair less mass
OOS which you control
OOS Thats fine.
OOS going with the minimum to reduce mass because my FOS is so high
OOS how much does the fly wheel weigh?
OOS no keep it low
OOS make it higher
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS maybe? what is yours
OOS okay we need this FOS to go up
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS we had excelent at one point
OOS wanna shoot for excellent? :P
OOS what's your FOS
OOS Good point, I could reduce my mass by .15 and the part will still be plenty strong
OOS are we all selected?
OOS someone changed thier mass
OOS we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
OOS looks like mass dropped a lot
OOS slim if you can without chaning your fos
OOS yes, we need to system wide reduce weight
OOS yes, 75 works for me and piston
OOS What's your FoS?
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS hmm ok
OOS we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
OOS what's your factor of safety currently
OOS What parameter do you control?
OOS im trying to broadcast with c=130
OOS we're good now
OOS I don't think so, all I need is piston bore diameter
OOS I am working with 70 right now, but it will need adjusted.
OOS What value would be ideal for the flywheel?
OOS yes
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS someones FOS is too low
OOS great
OOS For just the flywheel?
OOS 60mm
OOS nope
OOS Did you change anything? fos just tanked
OOS please do
OOS hey whats the crank length?
OOS I just followed up with him
OOS i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
OOS Crap. I wish it would update automaticly
OOS we at very good rn im happy with that
OOS In my simulation I increased Tf to 51. It brought the fos down ever so slightly, but brought down the mass by 2 kg for some reason
OOS since if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
OOS Something just took a hit. Any idea what changed?
OOS its 4821.91
OOS 17.5 would be great, lowers mass a ton
OOS if you get it lower than 2.0, you can try adding some mass, it's ok.
OOS Great - thanks
OOS What are your values now?
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS what are your design variables?
OOS Its at very good
OOS no I just asked piston pin guy
OOS hmm ok I'll check around
OOS I'm ending it
OOS well the grade scale shows that a total mass below 2 should be possible
OOS min fos = .38, max fos 1.32
OOS What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter?
OOS You dont need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
OOS any preference on the piston bore diameter
OOS What are you broadcasting?
OOS Fs = 2.04
OOS Hello, I am currently trying to solve for the piston-pin length, and I need the piston bore diameter (D). Do you happen to have this value?
OOS Can you broadcast a design with c as 130?
OOS gotta love it
OOS ya go ahead and change it back, can you lower D any more?
OOS Isnt our fos about which part has the lowest?
OOS What is your FOS?\
OOS agreed
OOS I have t1, L, and r
OOS My current fos in my table is 1.11
OOS FOS coz that's minimum
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS group-save current values as backup 2
OOS Did you broadcast that
OOS ok sweet
OOS my best was 1.67 at a bore diameter of 45
OOS i was trying to see which design was better
OOS what do you control and what do you need
OOS I have my best values broadcast with .12kg and FOS=3.44
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS were at very good rn
OOS Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
OOS 20.86 (mass of .6)
OOS if we could decrease for another 2 kg we should get excellent
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS yes
OOS Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
OOS Okay
OOS now it's back ?? idk
OOS I will change to 70
OOS what is your ms?
OOS then we will see how the fos changes
OOS Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
OOS if i go all the way to min weight is cuts fos and only shaves .03kg
OOS 51 and 1.1 my values keep getting messed up
OOS I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
OOS Yep just got paid
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
OOS yes
OOS Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
OOS this is as good as i can get i think
OOS can we submit now?
OOS That's odd, I don't have either of those variables
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS yea as low it gets my FOS shoots up
OOS The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
OOS same
OOS tf = 22 and ds = 49
OOS ok
OOS ok yeye
OOS truuu
OOS did you change something after excellent
OOS New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
OOS ill choose a word
OOS New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
OOS Will do I wrote them down
OOS we have excellent rn
OOS and i have leeway with my factor of safety
OOS Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value
OOS I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
OOS completely
OOS group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
OOS HEllo
OOS GOOD***
OOS Hey, have you broadcasted your values?
OOS one second
OOS I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
OOS idk what im doing at the moment
OOS 2.16
OOS ok neither have i
OOS What are your design variables currently?
OOS Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller? What about the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS the minimum it gives me is 150
OOS Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
OOS Sorry for the abrupt message
OOS right now it's 11.09
OOS try 40?
OOS Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
OOS D is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
OOS yes
OOS Diameter = 40 mm
OOS Interesting, the mass is what is hurting us but the FOS is beautifull
OOS okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
OOS Ok, mine is only .5. Idk how fos works but mine goes above 5k
OOS okay, so let's try to get a high FS, as flywheel has huge masses, and they well work on mass reduction
OOS Thanks
OOS It went down again
OOS try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
OOS we have excellent quality right now
OOS my mass is 1.12
OOS I think he influences it the most
OOS Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
OOS we're good now
OOS we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
OOS Can you improve FOS?
OOS Sounds good
OOS anyways ya ive given up on 375 but imma hang out in Hess's office starting next week
OOS what is your mass when you maximize your flywheel diameter and thickness
OOS Im still at poor quality... are you as well?
OOS Nice!
OOS Hey, I'm changing the piston diameter and the piston head thickness.  What parameters are you changing?
OOS I double checked the handout and yeah, it's only dependent on lower FOS
OOS I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
OOS 85 right now, I was trying to optimize mass
OOS mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
OOS yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight
OOS gotcha
OOS piston mass is currently 0.83
OOS Ok now it dropped
OOS trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
OOS I have my diameter set to 40, but that has likely changed since I last chacked
OOS So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
OOS what changed?
OOS Do you understand how it al fits together. I feel like we all only see that small snapshot of our component
OOS So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
OOS Hello! what's the piston bore diameter?
OOS D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
OOS yessir
OOS But I have the minimum fos so I'll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
OOS were at good lets leave it
OOS Can you send me your mass?
OOS Oh ok mine just updated
OOS do you have tf?
OOS We got very good
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS I used 70mm. Try to update yours
OOS i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
OOS 1.36
OOS what about thickness of flywheel?
OOS I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS will do
OOS someone changed a parameter
OOS no i don't think so
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS these are the same values I had for the "very good" design
OOS group-piston pin now
OOS updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
OOS no idea
OOS Same
OOS back to very good
OOS My mass range is around 0.02 to .12
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS i think ive optimized my part
OOS one sec
OOS Currently is 21.49 for me, FoS is 1.74
OOS 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
OOS i haven't updated
OOS I reduced mine to the lowest value, and our FOS is good now
OOS im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
OOS everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
OOS 3.64
OOS I can reduce it by lowering diameter or thickness which lowers my FOS
OOS My part is at the lowest mass possible currently
OOS we gotta talk
OOS I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
OOS 9.86
OOS Great Work
OOS It looks like our engine design is excellent then. And yes that works with my design requirements
OOS my bad, thanks 
OOS What are your design variables currently?
OOS Ok
OOS you said piston diameter is in your equation right?
OOS mass
OOS connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
OOS is it each part or globally
OOS what is yours?
OOS It went down again
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
OOS Our fos just dropped again
OOS my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
OOS I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages.
OOS My design includes r2 and r3, do those affect yours at all?
OOS also what are your ds and tf values
OOS Its the lowest mass with an FOS above 2
OOS Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
OOS Yes. My current design has a mass of 0.53 and a Fs of 2.1
OOS nope mine has been at 1.27
OOS Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
OOS I think i have my ideal broadcast
OOS ooooo it went down but so did FOS
OOS message back when you did it
OOS All I need is the diameter
OOS hello
OOS updated my mass to 1.19
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS I feel like its the crankshaft guy, everyone else has high fos
OOS I think 75 is the best right now
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS hell yeah
OOS No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
OOS I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
OOS thats an L
OOS did you make a change?
OOS what bore diameter are you thinking?
OOS no i don't need that
OOS What is the offset that is working well for you?
OOS yesss just the handfull of cash
OOS I can try and trim a little more tho]
OOS whats it to u
OOS that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
OOS rying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
OOS check
OOS okay, I'll try using that now
OOS reply when done
OOS could you make it larger?
OOS ill check
OOS my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
OOS I think flywheel has the lowest fos
OOS ok somehow we now have way too much mass
OOS perfect. thank you
OOS my foss is 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
OOS 2880
OOS 11.3
OOS ok
OOS sure
OOS what's your fos?
OOS a higher D increases the mass and FOS. With 85, my mass is 13.09 and FOS is 7.69
OOS yeah
OOS Crankshaft bearing offset? I don't control that variable!
OOS What are you using as your diameter
OOS And the mass?
OOS Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass = 0.12 and FOS = 3.44
OOS so I have two variables
OOS no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating
OOS We at fair. Good enough?
OOS can you bring FOS down? it only needs to be 2
OOS current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
OOS piston- pin designer
OOS because if I go with 50, FOS would be too low
OOS ayyyyyy
OOS i need c, t_f, ds
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS okay we got excellent. we should be done here
OOS otherwise my FOS is below 1
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS 4
OOS what shaft diameter are you using
OOS yep, we need to lower the overall mass
OOS Will make it larger only if you need
OOS Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
OOS what crankshaft offset is ideal for your design? I need it to design the flywheel
OOS got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
OOS keeping fos at 2
OOS hi, what are you working on?
OOS gotta be inclusive gosh
OOS I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
OOS yeah I
OOS No I have not
OOS okay, so you part and my part are the heaviest
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
OOS No I do not, I would consult the piston
OOS m at 1.63, fos at 53.27
OOS Ah I see
OOS the fos went up from 4821 to 5625
OOS Alrighty. Just updated it
OOS I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
OOS ok
OOS And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum
OOS 2.01
OOS That's ok.  I control the conrod length to crank length ratio (r1), does that affect you in any way?
OOS yeah thats the totla
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS Flywheel would be the heaviest part
OOS we are in excellent!
OOS which do you need
OOS whats your current FOS ?
OOS wait in the complete range?
OOS 75 is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement
OOS Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
OOS try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin fos remains above 2
OOS actually sorry i cant go below 150
OOS What varibales do you need to consider?
OOS says very good
OOS so for me besides diameter, i can play around with two variables
OOS I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do
OOS So is there any tradeoff at all?
OOS just did it
OOS but our system FOS is 1.25
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS same
OOS D, d_s, and t_f, but I don't know how to use those
OOS 85 right now
OOS what are your values
OOS Weigght!
OOS Not quite sure yet.
OOS We do
OOS goal weight is actually 35
OOS does your design depend on the flywheel at all?
OOS for some reason i cant go that low
OOS X|_|O
OOS im happy with that lol
OOS what I'm looking at is 60 and 12
OOS That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control
OOS right now
OOS Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
OOS ok don't change anything
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
OOS thats good
OOS what piston bore diameter are you using?
OOS because the overall mass and FOS are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago, now they're horrible lol
OOS 4 for head thickness and 75 for piston diameter
OOS we got it!
OOS try that
OOS c=150, dc=45
OOS the other values on our team are like between 2.5 and 5000
OOS really?
OOS 0.1 to 3.24 for mass, 1.72 to 54.23 for FS.
OOS we need less mass folks
OOS yes do that
OOS we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
OOS I don't think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from 40 to 70
OOS pretty close now actually
OOS what changed>
OOS q3: does it hav emoving parts
OOS your part seems pretty light how large can you make the FOS
OOS Lets see what happens?
OOS I have good for a design with thickness 10 and diameter 25
OOS so i dont want to change
OOS neither have we
OOS i do
OOS 47.5
OOS Yeah thats what I got
OOS What did you guys get
OOS can you try using 50 mm? and try to maximize the fos?
OOS literally dead lol - try to increase FOS
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS gg
OOS im also at 2 rn
OOS what's your fos?
OOS are you still using D = 40?
OOS ?
OOS No, I do not believe so
OOS 1.12
OOS the dream team
OOS Thanks
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS its the smallest I can go
OOS ds = 50
OOS And also the fos?
OOS Yeah for a second we were meeting both...I wonder what just updated?
OOS yeah uhhh that looks good. nice.
OOS me too
OOS I'm trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the fos while minimizing its mass
OOS and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS mine is m=0.69 and fos = 3.84
OOS For D =85, what was your mass
OOS gg
OOS well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more
OOS yeah thats ok the fos for othee's will be less
OOS did you change the bore diameter?
OOS Yes
OOS *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
OOS these are the variables I need to consider for design
OOS Can you do that? Right now its at 50
OOS what can you do with your diameter
OOS sitting at 2.77
OOS what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
OOS large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
OOS that's at my minimum dimensions, I can't
OOS Yes, that's the minimum diameter I can use
OOS me too
OOS There is no benefit for a FOS over 2
OOS c=150
OOS yes
OOS Yeah really
OOS ok i am not gonna change without letting yopu know
OOS what variables do you use?
OOS Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
OOS we need to do better though lol
OOS i willl try decreasing dc
OOS the plot on the white board
OOS XIXIO
OOS i switched it back to 45
OOS your FOS is in the thousands????
OOS I am staying at m 0.07 and fs 1.23
OOS what is your fos
OOS ok cool
OOS okay well we were at excellent and the other guys swear they didn't change anything lol
OOS Smaller works better for my FOS and Mass
OOS Yea, nvm we're good i think
OOS ok back to very good i say leabe it
OOS nah, I assume you're talking about the piston bore diameter right?
OOS what variables do you control?
OOS Well the flywheel has a fos of 5625.56
OOS Group: I will decrease mine now
OOS Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
OOS You?
OOS and keep D lower
OOS no
OOS or avg
OOS okay. I think the value is not this.
OOS we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs
OOS aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click "check for broadcast"
OOS i updated another design
OOS M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
OOS I think the 82.5 is the best. let me know when you are okay for me to change it back.
OOS I'll try
OOS fos is 1.92 and mass is 1.46
OOS 1.35
OOS Actually 2.83. read the wrong one
OOS the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter
OOS No mines the same
OOS mine is at the highest possible value
OOS It's 3.41
OOS X|_|o
OOS are you broadcasting the values giving that weight?
OOS who is this?!
OOS yeah they say they cant decrease it any more
OOS just did. .03kg
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS f_os = 9193.31
OOS piston told me
OOS Yo
OOS Hold where you are
OOS Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
OOS i didnt
OOS ok i got fos 2.02 and mass of 5.82
OOS I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and fos
OOS it doesnt impact it much, and my part is low mass so if i have to change it, that wont be a big deal
OOS our FOS still needs to go up
OOS yes, that was what I was thinking
OOS q4: did we talk about it in our classes this semester?
OOS 55
OOS what is your current mass?
OOS ok cool
OOS 12 for thickness
OOS im at 2.36
OOS does your design require any spesific value for piston diameter
OOS I've had it at the first one, but it says you may need my thickness to change
OOS Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS OK
OOS Sounds good. Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then
OOS kool
OOS 1.93 right now
OOS have you reached an ideal value for your part yet?
OOS What are your mass and FOS?
OOS Whats your current diameter?
OOS cool, let us know if we should change the bore diameter
OOS I let the mknow
OOS how about you?
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
OOS We need to increase FOS somehow
OOS For the diameter it is 25 right now
OOS oops sorry for the repeat
OOS I asked the guy, he said it was normal
OOS aight bet
OOS best I get
OOS What is the mass of your components?
OOS That's good
OOS How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and FOS?
OOS yeah agreed
OOS do u know how many rounds we get?
OOS group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
OOS same, i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
OOS more like first hour
OOS New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
OOS Alright.
OOS hey, whats the size of the piston bore?
OOS Nope
OOS 82.5 i was thinking, the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
OOS ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
OOS i agree with that
OOS Ok. We need total to be less than 3. My part costs roughly 0.6 when combined with the piston-pin.
OOS 11.3
OOS mine is 2.09
OOS currently 0.06
OOS i know, my design is basically fixed
OOS 1.67
OOS but I can slightly increase mass to get 2.63 FOS
OOS Alright, thank you!
OOS my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
OOS I dont think those effect my design. Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else
OOS about 12
OOS hows it going
OOS That's literally the lowest value i have that's above 2 though
OOS t_h is currently 2
OOS ?
OOS yes, one minute on that
OOS i think so?
OOS What is your mass?
OOS yeah
OOS piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
OOS 40
OOS exellent dont toucu
OOS helloooo
OOS *what values is everyone in control of
OOS lmao both of them?
OOS Ok with the minimum mass, for the flywheel, Fs is still 1215
OOS who are you
OOS mass/FOS?
OOS A bit. I can lower bore diameter
OOS 37.46 and 2.06
OOS the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
OOS how much does the connecting rod currently weigh?
OOS Ok, I'll ask them if so and then we can go from there. That looks like a hard simulation to run.
OOS whats your current FOS
OOS Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
OOS is bore diameter piston diameter
OOS Hi what is the mass that you are currently using?
OOS no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
OOS we got it, don't change things
OOS Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
OOS Perfect!
OOS 0.87
OOS 40 inches.
OOS yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
OOS I have, at least on my screen.
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS What is your fos?
OOS group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
OOS lets try only  small changes now since we are at very good, maybe make it to excellent
OOS We need to decrease mass a lot
OOS we have excellent quality right now
OOS I didn't change anything
OOS what happended to our FOS?
OOS my connecting rod length = 1/(crank length)
OOS I have the best broadcast available for my thing
OOS Can you change D?
OOS did you just change something?
OOS I am at my lowest mass possible
OOS maybe we should just call it good
OOS keep it up and we'll trim from there
OOS what is your offset right now
OOS go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
OOS What factors are you interested in?
OOS It was good for a second, what happened
OOS Do we want to end with very good?
OOS go back to what you had bc we were at good
OOS hey try changing the diameter to 90
OOS DONT CHANGE
OOS $2 missed
OOS 3.62
OOS Currently 3.2
OOS awesome, thanks
OOS FOS 2.06
OOS my fos is 2
OOS I think a lower D is better. something like a 75 was giving us a good weight
OOS 20.86
OOS ?
OOS 27.44
OOS mass is .37
OOS it was just at very good, someone changed and it went up a lot
OOS select *
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS It's just updated, now mass is 3.11 and FOS is 2.07
OOS if any of your values changed go back to what it was
OOS nope
OOS can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
OOS yeah the pin is pretty light, shouldnt be an issue
OOS lets gooo
OOS mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
OOS what mare mass values around an fos of 2
OOS try using 50 mm
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
OOS bet
OOS Hello
OOS I am considering the piston diameter and the piston head thickness
OOS hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by .28
OOS *of mass
OOS if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
OOS did oyu change?
OOS Lower D works better for both me and the rod designer, do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS i have mass 1.27, FOS: 15886
OOS need: piston bore diamter
OOS its the flywheel guy
OOS Hey, what fos, do you think would be good enough, 1.5-2.25 ish?
OOS Mine are, but i have not made any drastic changes since. Your lowering of ds helped me shave off 2 more lbs
OOS U mean 0.672?
OOS r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
OOS we need smaller mass folks
OOS so it looks like our mass is killing us now
OOS 2.43 which is a bit high
OOS It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
OOS now im using diameter = 55 thickness 15
OOS no
OOS Yeah I noticed the same thing
OOS what's your current piston bore diameter?
OOS Increase your mass slightly
OOS and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
OOS if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
OOS it's very good right now
OOS Yeah, I have not changed anything since my parameters were at the bounds of what I could input so I'll reach out to the other folks about it
OOS the simulation results for me show the subsystem fos
OOS do you have any variable that seems to match with those?
OOS ahh gotcha
OOS Global quality looking bad though
OOS are we all selected?
OOS fos = 7.98
OOS doesnt have to be ;)
OOS pretty sure its someone else
OOS nah
OOS am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
OOS probably
OOS I'm now at 2.77, all my numbers are at their minimum 
OOS Will keep you updated
OOS what is your mass?
OOS Are you changing youre values?
OOS My bad, currently at best option. Lowest mass, higher Fos
OOS The conrod hasn't changed anything
OOS how did the mass increase by this much
OOS In the current broadcast, the value is 15
OOS gives excellent
OOS Okay try and change C
OOS do you rely on a c or a dc?
OOS try to find a good combination at D=40
OOS actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
OOS gotchya thanks
OOS back at80
OOS piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
OOS hmm, anything I can do to help reduce your mass?
OOS It's not me
OOS *?
OOS mass is 0.54 and fos is 3286
OOS alright.
OOS I was testing the lower diameter for less mass. Changed it back now
OOS mass = 1.27 and f_os = 15886.04
OOS like my FS just went from 1.9 to 2.2 without me changin anything for my part
OOS Same.
OOS you done?
OOS Yes
OOS What are your two variables at
OOS great fos right now
OOS We did
OOS Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
OOS what i was told
OOS _|_|O
OOS my mass is 1.27 already
OOS the piston wont respond
OOS only *
OOS Check the top of the second page of the handout
OOS the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass
OOS GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
OOS I just saved mass changing tf to 30
OOS ya we just lowered it all the way, how are your numbers
OOS 60 mm
OOS currently my mass is 0.53
OOS I'm just doing what he tells me tbh
OOS we should always report current fos
OOS increasing D gives me a worse weight
OOS increases it
OOS Thanks :) I'll work with that for now, let me know if you end up making any final changes
OOS what is your fs?
OOS is it possible for that to go lower
OOS I think hes at fos 1.64 and mass of 2,26 but that was a while ago
OOS no - must be someone else I guess?
OOS yes
OOS For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
OOS what is your ms?
OOS What is your FOS and mass at currently?
OOS don't change
OOS wait
OOS got it, hmmm
OOS Currently 2.95
OOS lmaaaooooo
OOS I dont have those variables on my diagrams, what do they represent?
OOS do you need it to be higher or  lower?
OOS yes
OOS Is that the lowest mass setting without compromising fos
OOS Whats the best you can get with a bore diameter of 80?
OOS We're still seeing 80 as the globally broadcast value. Weird.
OOS so lmk if it stays at 150
OOS Nope things changed to the worst now
OOS Yes
OOS I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS what is c?
OOS most of mass is in piston and flywheel
OOS How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
OOS tandy
OOS i can do 40 easy
OOS okay, I'm going to try and change c
OOS yeah that is what im using
OOS the minimum mass I have while the FOS is above 2 is 5.45. I have made 14 simulations to justify the result.
OOS i have no clue whats happening with that. my mass is too low to have an impact
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS We at fair. Good enough?
OOS I currently have 10 for thickness and 17.5 for diameter
OOS we have our fos up, try reducing the mass
OOS okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
OOS Hello
OOS do you have the 1.65 fos?
OOS Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow
OOS hmm
OOS Ok cool
OOS what is your current ds
OOS I havnt changed anything
OOS This is strange
OOS hah punnnnnnny
OOS mine are piston diameter and head thickness
OOS minimum mass that has FOS > 2
OOS ok
OOS yup thats working!
OOS if you did you need to go back
OOS yes
OOS its at very good
OOS yup
OOS Whats your mass and Fos?
OOS My FOS is at 2.29.
OOS Do you have any that depend on the piston pin?
OOS The highest performance is at 3.91 FOS and 5.2M
OOS neato
OOS gg team
OOS agreed, we can still try to look for improvements
OOS no worries
OOS seems like the sim values FOS over weight as far as getting from "fair" to "good"
OOS crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
OOS what is the mass of your design?
OOS Can you change piston diamter without affecting your FOS and mass much? With the current diamteter my max FOS is only 0.51
OOS Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
OOS Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
OOS What is your range for diameter?
OOS I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
OOS no we should go for excellent
OOS our mass just went up 20kg...
OOS Made diameter 75
OOS Thank you
OOS whats your lower limit?
OOS 1.7 with bearing offset of 300
OOS 150
OOS Yes, with that my FOS is now 2.17
OOS Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen
OOS Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
OOS 85 is the updated
OOS what are you working on?
OOS yeet
OOS The TA guy said its the lowest value between us
OOS Hello
OOS we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
OOS how about for fos
OOS My system FS is 2.05 atm
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS 1.71 (mass range: 1.13 to 3.12) and 4.55 (fos range: 4.55 to 0.44)
OOS for c = 85 dc = 15 ds = 25 tf= 30 D = 70 fos = 2.37
OOS crankshaft a lil suspicious too
OOS I will be using 40mm going forward
OOS okay we have very good again
OOS Yeah, the flywheel won't break, so i was just minimizing mass
OOS So far, the 90mm looked better than the 97.5mm
OOS Ok
OOS Hey, I'm good for now, thanks. let me know if you need anything from me
OOS That might not be worth it then
OOS i have to choose the heaviest part now
OOS Right now I'm using D = 85
OOS should I try to lean toward FS since my masses are about 1 to 4 and FS ranges are .5 to 3 ish?
OOS increase FS decrease mass of the connecting rod
OOS we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
OOS I think its the piston changing but not sure
OOS awesome fos
OOS ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
OOS im so confused what happened
OOS (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
OOS does a larger diameter increase your mass? or decrease it?
OOS What are you working on?
OOS yeah, I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can
OOS adjust which part?
OOS what, the crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS no
OOS chat with piston pin to determine that
OOS mine says 4.26 and 0.6
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
OOS FOS is 2.85
OOS Im at 2nd lowest mass
OOS what mass are you working with?
OOS its the flywheel guy
OOS Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness
OOS Sounds good.  I'll try to decrease shaft mass
OOS Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
OOS We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
OOS same
OOS crankshaft bearing offset
OOS correct
OOS y'all we need to get the FS to 2
OOS ok yeah so really small. I was just wondering why mass was so high
OOS goal weight is actually 35
OOS for m=3.48
OOS thanks, can you try increasing it to around 97.5 or something, Im trying to see how it effects my numbers
OOS I havent updated anything, so it was either crankshaft or connecting rod
OOS D =75
OOS bark
OOS D=75, m = 1.36, fos = 2.85
OOS We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable
OOS and thickness
OOS what's your design variables?
OOS We are compromising mass
OOS I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
OOS I havent updated anything
OOS LOWER YOUR FOS
OOS did you just increase your mass?
OOS I think that is an average of each designer's parts which is why I think someone's dimensions aren
OOS minimize it if you can while keeping fos as close to 2 as possible
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS Let's try 75
OOS group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
OOS I cannot bring that down too much farther as Fs is at 2.1
OOS the piston wont respond to me
OOS global is at 2.47, individual is 15886.04
OOS No. Mine is 2.36
OOS I had it at m = 0.04 and f = 0.74 when the status of the engine was good
OOS Yes, I want to minimize mass but also don't want the piston head to fail
OOS are you changing things
OOS decrease mass
OOS whats your mass?
OOS what is your fos?
OOS alright, just get FOS to right above 2 and that'll have to do
OOS Do you have an option of an FOS of at least 1?
OOS 2.31
OOS tell me if it's better for you if I use greater value
OOS hahaha
OOS mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
OOS do you need me to change my thickness or anything like that? changing my thickness only affects my mass by 1.5 kg max if it helps you out with mass
OOS currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
OOS Mine are flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
OOS yeah
OOS *?
OOS mass = 11.09
OOS Yeah, I'm leaving mine as is for now. Trying to figure out why our total mass is so high.
OOS i do not
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS piston is about to update me with D. I need it to be low too. How about you
OOS The piston has a diameter of 75
OOS I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts. I dont need them, fos = 0.71 now
OOS I need to change D to 85 though
OOS mass went up quite a bit on my end
OOS someone touched it
OOS make sure crank shaft guy knows that and try to figure out how an increase or decrease in that effect the FOS and the mass
OOS ???
OOS Well you've got the crankshaft, it should be the heaviest
OOS nice. So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
OOS are you chaning values and updating your broadcast?
OOS Thanks, I'm good on my end. Is there anything you need from my end?
OOS what are your design variables?
OOS i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
OOS What's your system mass and FOS?
OOS my mass = 6. im guessing connecting rod?
OOS is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you?
OOS i think we should just leave it
OOS y'all we need to get the FS to 2
OOS Hi, please keep me updated on the piston bore diameter
OOS Do you need info from me
OOS mas is up pretty high
OOS FOS is good. Mass is 10kg too high
OOS the systemwide weight is kinda high
OOS I need a bore of at most 48
OOS i can't go lower than this
OOS that makes sense.  i just maxed my fos right now
OOS So we need to get min mass and max FOS flywheelbut we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
OOS Same. 40 is the way to go
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS i'm determining c and dc
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS Whats your current diameter?
OOS got it
OOS 5625
OOS that wasnt me
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS D = 90
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
OOS we are in excellent!
OOS Do you know how C affects your FoS
OOS yeah
OOS me too
OOS it went down
OOS Looks like our FOS went up
OOS Who's in control of bore diameter?
OOS weight let me update my design
OOS good work
OOS Okay we are at
OOS I'm getting poor right now
OOS something changed we were closer
OOS Does youyr part depend on my values?
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS Yeah, that was weird haha
OOS okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
OOS ya
OOS ok
OOS and piston  diameter will affect my performance quality
OOS d_c
OOS What's the updated mass for the crankshaft?
OOS My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
OOS thinking about changing it to 55
OOS X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS what is your FOS now?
OOS I've changed to the lowest mass acceptable for fs > 2 for the piston
OOS do you depend on t1 or r1?
OOS What are those three?
OOS Oh yeah
OOS I say we stop changing
OOS that's big
OOS at 62.5 the mass goes up from 1.89 to 2.94
OOS Okay, thank you
OOS I don't actually
OOS ok ill leave then
OOS I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
OOS currently 1.64
OOS wow ok
OOS ds-60
OOS I need to know your crankshaft bearing offset value so tell me if you find anything good
OOS its already over 2
OOS yeah min is 2.77
OOS i did it
OOS Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
OOS and mass?
OOS Also, does me increasing c help you at all?
OOS Yeah, what's your system mass atm?
OOS So, is it good for you to be minimized?
OOS Do you want a lagre mass?
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS flywheel - update the group when you change!
OOS How much does our weight go up if you increase D?
OOS we at very good rn im happy with that
OOS sorry 50 mm
OOS hmm
OOS what is your fos now?
OOS agreed but isnt the factor of safety shown above that of the part with the lowest fos?
OOS So far as I can tell, I just need to make sure that this number is smaller than your flywheel thickness
OOS I would double my system weight though.
OOS right now we need to focus on mass
OOS We at fair. Good enough?
OOS enough money for me
OOS Yes
OOS Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
OOS but you can't change that right?
OOS No, I do not need anything
OOS im just telling you you need to start hustlin
OOS It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I'm doing something wrong
OOS do you need any of my variables?
OOS Crankshaft asked for bore diameter. Thats all
OOS Can you do D =85?
OOS at excellent so dont change anything
OOS yay
OOS I'm good, thanks
OOS Wait, did you just change a value?
OOS I could try
OOS What value of the piston diameter should I use?
OOS Did your values just change?
OOS Lowering the diameter increases my FoS by about 4 and increases mass by about 1kg
OOS okay, I will see what i can do with 53
OOS Sorry, mass 25.69, fos 1.45
OOS f_os = 9193.31
OOS cuz mine depends on that
OOS Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
OOS hello?
OOS The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass
OOS Hello.  Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
OOS it can range from 2 to 60
OOS No one is updating broadcast
OOS what's your current value?
OOS *he or she
OOS mine is 1200
OOS No i don't think so
OOS see what the other group members say
OOS same
OOS i think this is a trap
OOS GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS i see mine hadnt updated yet
OOS whoever changed it change back
OOS do you think lower diameter will give you a higher fos?
OOS they don't wanna give us 20 bucks
OOS why isnt this exxcellent
OOS piston mass is currently 0.83
OOS X _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS Its now at 82.5
OOS What's your flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel?
OOS yes
OOS ooo nice
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS nvm
OOS who changed
OOS we can tone it down some still
OOS try increasing your fos without increasing mass too much
OOS Is there any information I could give you that could help your design?
OOS 0.11
OOS 18.63
OOS I have two I can jump behind but it depends on what everyone else can get m and fos to
OOS and we need all the help we can get with fs
OOS time is up it says on my system
OOS i only depend on the piston
OOS great fos right now
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is.  we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS crankshaft has a mass of 28
OOS what is the category?
OOS the one guy did not respond to my message
OOS same here
OOS I'm broadcasting my lowest I got
OOS yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good
OOS I think we should be good, just don't change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
OOS ok that was what I was seeing as well
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
OOS I assume the 30 was for the thickness right?
OOS we're at good
OOS Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
OOS Yeah that's what im trying to find out
OOS how are your masses and FS looking?
OOS and then I depend on ds, t_f, and D
OOS could you lower the mass by 2 kg without skrewing the fos
OOS you could try increasing D a little and see what happens overall
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS ?
OOS flywheel no word at all
OOS group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
OOS check with the others
OOS Same
OOS Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass
OOS is the FOS of the design the lowest FOS of any one subsystem?
OOS I can try
OOS what are your ds and tf?
OOS lets decrease mass
OOS no i do not. i am compiling everyones
OOS okay cool everyone responded
OOS thanks
OOS ok how much can you decrease mass before below 2?
OOS okay so lower D is better?
OOS my mass is 1.71
OOS My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone
OOS GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
OOS Nope
OOS Wait, 13000 for FoS?
OOS my mass is 0.52
OOS or is it each case by case for each part ?
OOS I think c needs to be changed
OOS okay
OOS so hows life
OOS OK STOP
OOS ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor
OOS damn, same here 
OOS tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
OOS sweet thanks - let me know when you do
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS and Thickness of the flywheel
OOS I think the flywheel keeps changing values. I cant get a response tho
OOS thanks
OOS My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
OOS so really not much
OOS back at 80
OOS its good now just mass to worry about
OOS Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
OOS bottom
OOS minimize the weight of crankshaft and increase fos
OOS diameter is 25
OOS Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
OOS I just updated it to that. I'll let the other people know
OOS Supposedly increasing the offset increases m and decreases f, so lose-lose for me
OOS Makes sense, but when I improve mine the overall systems decreases.
OOS nor crankshaft
OOS How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
OOS (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
OOS What are your mass and FOS?
OOS yep
OOS i waaaaaant mooooney
OOS ok
OOS It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn't have to blindly flail about, not knowing who has been told what yet
OOS X X O ; O O X ; X O O
OOS Right now I have D=85
OOS what's your FOS?
OOS whats the d and t values you
OOS it's corrected now
OOS Wasn't me
OOS Thanks
OOS Can you change ds to 55 and braodcast
OOS I put mine to initial values and the FOS is good now
OOS For better or worse. want me to change mine and see how it affects yours real quick
OOS Yeah I think that's the best we can get
OOS Thanks
OOS from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS hmm okay
OOS hello
OOS Can you decrease c to 60 and see what you get?
OOS GROUP: keep communicating!
OOS idk they haven't been super responsive
OOS I think so
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS Cool
OOS okay, what mass are you at!
OOS Your FOS is huge
OOS my design is basically fixed, i found a good design that have decent fos but not too heavy
OOS thank you!
OOS ok we're close
OOS whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
OOS Hello
OOS need: piston bore diamter
OOS what fos are you broadcasting?
OOS Are we good to end?
OOS the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS my FOS is 2.01
OOS D = 75, r2=0.89, r3=0.8
OOS that doesn't make sense, you said your mass was 3.46?
OOS so let's lower our weight first
OOS ok we're close
OOS sorry 60
OOS I think flywheel is where our problems are
OOS go back to what we were at
OOS Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
OOS how did the mass go up
OOS same
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
OOS now 1.46
OOS dont move
OOS I think it's dependent on the flywheel, crankshaft, and connecting rod values at this point
OOS I haven't broadcasted yet ho
OOS Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there?
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS (To all): ok with results
OOS my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize fos
OOS oh wait no
OOS ranges
OOS do you think I should try and increase those?
OOS Will do.
OOS Did you make any change after it was at very good?
OOS try to find a combo that gets you just above 2 fos but the lowest mass
OOS minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize fos
OOS frick my mass is 57
OOS yeah, working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass
OOS so why is our tital so low?
OOS ya, and im at poor quality, are you as well?
OOS We need to have the heavy parts drop mass
OOS can youget it lower?
OOS i was kidding about 3d
OOS 2.42
OOS just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
OOS Broadcast the latest values
OOS sounds good ill do 45
OOS kk ill test
OOS and fos
OOS that wasnt me
OOS can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera?
OOS yuh
OOS no ive checked
OOS Oh I've got a different system FOS, mine is about 2
OOS gg
OOS our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
OOS yes
OOS hey, Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be 10 mm, is this what you got?
OOS i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
OOS we desperately need to reduce weight
OOS What is the piston bore diameter?
OOS excellent
OOS actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
OOS no
OOS Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS we got excellent
OOS X|X|O
OOS So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
OOS can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
OOS once you figure it out
OOS Whichever works best for you
OOS im using a 40
OOS also, can you give me tf (flywheel thickness)?
OOS basically all i can do is increase mass of the connecting and therefore increase facotr of safety
OOS ok
OOS great!!
OOS I think we are good if we get excellent maybe?
OOS *what values is everyone in control of
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
OOS It just updated to 3.2, but yea. Is there any parameter you need from me?
OOS how do I broadcast?
OOS Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
OOS ;)
OOS That makes no sense
OOS when i try to bump FS up it moves us from very good to good so im  leaving it
OOS No. My values have been the same since about 9:45.
OOS w
OOS what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
OOS I haven't changed my dimensions for awhile now, hope that helps
OOS oops, wrong value, my bad
OOS nice
OOS so i dont think that i can change that much
OOS What piston bore diameter are you using?
OOS okay can di
OOS What testbed variables do you have?
OOS No
OOS so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your FOS
OOS 105
OOS My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
OOS I tihnk its the same thing
OOS Can you change that to 85?  or close to it?  That's what I have
OOS holy cow someone is making major changes
OOS and*
OOS yo bro
OOS Thanks
OOS what option are you currently on
OOS Makes sense, the connecting rod probably has more impact on FOS than mass
OOS We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
OOS I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
OOS my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
OOS and FOS?
OOS someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
OOS on my screen it says your limit is between 150 and 300?
OOS what ranges of mass do you have for your part?
OOS mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
OOS Hello
OOS Yeah
OOS what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
OOS If the piston diameter is 75, I can get a good mix of mass and fs
OOS im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
OOS so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit
OOS We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
OOS I have not changed mine
OOS yep
OOS Yes
OOS what values are you using for the flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel
OOS no idea, our mass is way too high and FOS too low
OOS Are you in charge of choosing the piston bore diameter?
OOS with what I have now my mass is the lowest it can be
OOS Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
OOS its conrod
OOS 61.91
OOS I meant shaft diameter
OOS How's the design going? I think we got to an excellent rating already!
OOS I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
OOS ok so id say you worry more about low mass with D and I can worry more about high FOS with ds
OOS ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
OOS I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong
OOS sounds good
OOS so youre at the value that is closest to 2 fos/
OOS Yea, it's better to minimize c
OOS did I?
OOS But I haven't changed anything and it went down.
OOS What's your mass?
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
OOS does yours show exccelent?
OOS any good values for the piston bore D?
OOS What variables do you control?
OOS if you increase the diameter
OOS My current fos is 5625.56
OOS Kind of, increasing thickness increases FOS
OOS i  have fos at 3.23
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by .15 while also increasing fos by .65
OOS The diameter is now at 40.
OOS but we can try to imporve
OOS Do we want to end with very good?
OOS I changed something but it didn't affect my mass at all
OOS r2 and r3 of the piston pin
OOS also broadcast those, I am not using your variables others might
OOS Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
OOS group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
OOS For the flywheel shaft diameter i have 10
OOS Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
OOS do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight?
OOS c
OOS Cause the FOS only goes up by like .5
OOS gg team
OOS (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
OOS i have a fos of 2.47
OOS great minds think alike
OOS Gotcha
OOS Yeah
OOS tell me if it's better to use greater value because 40mm is the minimum value
OOS ok mine is the largest.  Im gonna decrease
OOS Tell me the tradeoffs
OOS I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
OOS back at 80
OOS same i have a minimized mass currently and stall a 3 fos
OOS 2.08
OOS someone is messing this up, are values are getting very bad
OOS aight
OOS Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
OOS Nevermind we getting there!
OOS Nope, havent changed anything
OOS do you control piston bore diameter?
OOS do you know if you can reduce mass?
OOS m=0.07 FOS=1.23
OOS Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness, piston bore diameter
OOS i dont know where to reduce the weight tho
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS bore diameter
OOS interesting
OOS Currently have a simulation at c=150, dc=50 ds=40 tf=51 D=105 with projected output ms=23.24 and fos=3.96
OOS good point
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS It's the same tradeoff for everyone
OOS wait can you explain again
OOS need: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS Ok looks like we're good
OOS Don't change anything
OOS I see that c should be 60 is that what you have?
OOS I cant
OOS Cus thats our weak point rn
OOS is your fos 0.44?
OOS Since the lowest of my designs is like 140, I'm going to prioritize mass reduction
OOS my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
OOS 1.14
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
OOS Whichever gets you the highest
OOS my second option is m = 20.55 and fos = 2.83
OOS Can you send me your mass?
OOS I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel
OOS my variables depend on piston bore diameter
OOS Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
OOS grp-im done
OOS What factors are you interested in?
OOS arent lining up
OOS so even with 2.01 FOS we can get excellent
OOS fos is bad
OOS What did u choose for D?
OOS What are your values
OOS oh wait, it might be the connecting rod
OOS how does dc affect mass and factor of safety
OOS Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
OOS how can you maximize fos and we can work around that maybe?
OOS I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter, do those affect yours?
OOS Do you have direct control over piston diameter (D)?
OOS ok
OOS my masss is 6.28
OOS We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
OOS I need: piston bore diameter
OOS Does increasing c increase the mass or decrease
OOS can try small changes
OOS okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
OOS hello?
OOS Not by much. I can find values that work for it quickly
OOS thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter
OOS there is a default one but i'm trying to figure out how to change it
OOS or it
OOS how will those affect your value
OOS ok
OOS gotcha
OOS Yeah, I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me.
OOS left side when walking in
OOS 2.77 for a diameter of 40
OOS nothing much i could change at 45
OOS what are you currently using for D?
OOS I haven't changed in 5 mins
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it
OOS did you change anything?
OOS mass = 1.19
OOS make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
OOS it is at 150
OOS 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
OOS I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
OOS ok i will lessen the thickness!
OOS I decreases mass bu 0.04 and decreased FOS by 2 due to piston changes
OOS We need to decrease mass a lot
OOS you can change it and change it back if it gets worse
OOS ours just does donuts as of rn
OOS awesome job
OOS Okay no longer good on FOS
OOS kg
OOS our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me, can you try and get them to talk to me :( I need to discuss values with them
OOS Hello, what variables do you have control over?
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
OOS group: who's next?
OOS oh wow haha okay
OOS Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
OOS mine are piston diameter and head thickness
OOS We're done
OOS Okay I'm using my results for 80
OOS I'm still seeing 'poor' on my end
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS okay sounds good
OOS If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with FS less then 2
OOS im not sure if everyone is on board.
OOS keep other component variables constant?
OOS Ok, someone changed something and made it much worse
OOS what happended to our FOS?
OOS Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS wait someone changed something and it went way down
OOS At 75 diameter for me, the best I have is 2.85FOS and 6.26mass
OOS you?
OOS perfect
OOS I'm pretty sure no one depends on my variables though
OOS good idea
OOS Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
OOS can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
OOS I don't think so
OOS yeah that makes sense
OOS did you change anything
OOS we are at very good
OOS 2.36
OOS someone changed it again
OOS also i changed the diameter to 45
OOS my time is up
OOS It wasn't me or the piston. Ive recorded my values in case something happens
OOS If we could lower the offset, that would optimize my fos
OOS diameter and thickness
OOS ggs
OOS connecting rod thickness (t1) and connecting rod length ratio (r1)
OOS What piston diameter are you using that works well?
OOS flywheel changed a value and i lost 5 lbs!
OOS group-piston pin now
OOS What's going on, bud?
OOS so let's lower our weight first
OOS whats your mass
OOS I dont use ds I think
OOS okay sounds goof
OOS my current fos is 1.35, conrod has 7.69, what do you have?
OOS 75
OOS can you share your variable letters (what you control and what you need)
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS What is your current FOS?
OOS now its 4.92
OOS also you can only see a few of the design variables, so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn't as good
OOS Wanna call it?
OOS What is your range for diameter?
OOS is your fs still 2.1?
OOS Is there anything I can do to help you?
OOS I'm not entirely sure. No matter what inputs I have, my mass and fos aren't changing and it;s a bit confusing
OOS with a ratio of 4
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS Also, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
OOS i got barely any points on the third problem
OOS yeah i have the same questionb
OOS if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
OOS what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
OOS Hello
OOS Yeah
OOS lmk what you think
OOS ok don't change anything
OOS what is your bore diameter?
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS 47.5
OOS Don't think so
OOS I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
OOS we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible
OOS but I think we're struggling with FOS now
OOS m = 0.07 and fos = 1.59
OOS how about increasing fos?
OOS i need: piston bore diameter
OOS Flywheel is thinking we need to reduce mass
OOS What Bore diameter are you thinking about using?
OOS interstingly pisto-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
OOS okay
OOS Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
OOS Same
OOS make sure you update the global broadcast
OOS Are you still running with diameter of 40
OOS but imma find em
OOS :)
OOS Ok I think someone is confused
OOS like i kinda dgaf about 375 anymore
OOS If you can make the bore Diameter 40 then I can get an Fos of 3.44
OOS Try and decrease C so that we increase the factor of safety
OOS have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
OOS Do you depend on any of my variables?
OOS Is 40 the best value you have found for D
OOS Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
OOS Can you lower your diameter a touch? My options depend only on that.
OOS Okay, how about you try to increase your FS, prioritize that
OOS Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better FOS
OOS we are at excellent again
OOS diameter D has been at 40 whole time
OOS is this scooter
OOS Sweet, by how much?
OOS Lets not change anything and get that $20
OOS mine is still at excellent so I don't know
OOS i dont htink piston did either
OOS Yes, that is when I used piston bore diameter of 105
OOS I'll check in with you on that in a sec
OOS what is the offset you have decided to use for the crannkshaft bearing offset?
OOS group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
OOS Do you need info from me
OOS what do you need to increase it?
OOS what is your mass and fos?
OOS piston diameter is 75, thickness is 10.5
OOS I tried decreasing my mass
OOS mass
OOS Currently the size is 40
OOS nope! do you need info from me?
OOS Hey, I am going to need the flywheel shaft diameter and the thickness of the flywheel. Do you have any possible numbers
OOS ya the fos is so bad
OOS I control the r values which will change the mass and the fos
OOS did it affect the overall?
OOS Just broadcasted it. I set D at 55
OOS I can reduce the mass of the piston, but, it's going to cost a bit on FOS. Drops FOS by 1 ish
OOS my lowest FOS is over 4000, crankshaft is the only person I would have to talk to\
OOS (i think)
OOS I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
OOS we should always report current fos
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS for your ouputs only?
OOS Who changed?
OOS it just said very good
OOS The mass increased a lot
OOS ok conrod's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
OOS great, done then
OOS I'm talking to fly wheel about it
OOS 75-105
OOS Would increasing or decreasing ds lower the weight?
OOS Mass yes
OOS Someone just changed something
OOS Diameter is 40 mm
OOS yes, the minimum is 700 haha
OOS piston pin has theirs at 1.23 and says that's their highest option
OOS its piston pin designer
OOS what is you flywheel thickness?
OOS we had "good" at one point didnt we?
OOS I adjusted my numbers, mass is now 0.16 fos is 4.66
OOS do you have a diameter that you feel comfortable working with?
OOS Do you have control over D?
OOS PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
OOS im at 2.07
OOS Hell to the yeah
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS ok
OOS cool
OOS wont let me
OOS i meant for your part
OOS just kidding, back to poor. 
OOS Let me know if you change the bearing offset
OOS and FOS?
OOS Lets not change it now
OOS I think you need to change your c value
OOS Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
OOS what is your pin diameter?
OOS what is the mass of your system?
OOS Group- only piston engineer edits
OOS Is either tf or ds a variable of other subsystems for you?
OOS So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS doing that now
OOS sounds good
OOS 12 kg? damn
OOS Same
OOS no mine is 2.0
OOS #ERROR!
OOS now*
OOS if u want to adjust urs, u can announce to all chats
OOS ok cool
OOS We've got a "Good" engine
OOS How about you?
OOS can you increase it to around 2 or 3
OOS Do you need any info from me?
OOS Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
OOS oh true
OOS ?
OOS I'm at 1.01 for mass if fos = 2.03. I don't think that can get better unless a shared dimension changes
OOS Currently I think the mass is too much.
OOS try flyweel thickness as 12.0 and shaft diameter as 60.0
OOS try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our fos significantly
OOS our weight is too high
OOS like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
OOS I just got my FOS up to 9
OOS whats your FOS if you drop mass by 3kg
OOS I believe FOS of 2.31
OOS Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
OOS Is anybody out there?
OOS i don't believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
OOS (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
OOS My piston mass is 0.52 and FOS is 2.01
OOS what can we do in terms of slimming down mass
OOS can you please share your variables with just the letters
OOS Need to increase FOS
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that 
OOS Piston bore diameter
OOS c=60, dc=15
OOS sweet we just need to get mass down
OOS mass = 4, FoS = 2.4
OOS just leave it im fine with very good
OOS something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
OOS space
OOS Same haha
OOS how much weigh tcan you trim generally?
OOS can you try to reduce tf at all
OOS idk whos changing stuff
OOS so thats nice
OOS ill try
OOS i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
OOS it drops the FOS
OOS Alright. Do you have a value for the flywheel diameter?
OOS ok let me see how that effects my design
OOS mass?
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
OOS Hi, looks like we should increase the factor of safety. What factor of safety do you have for the piston
OOS flywheel says they have an FOS of 3286 apparently?
OOS 45=1.7, 48=1.15
OOS at this point, just piston diameter
OOS Don't change anything
OOS i think everyone else has more influence than i do.  my max fos i can go to is 1.23 at the moment and my max mass is0.07
OOS i think so
OOS I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
OOS i just rebroadcasted
OOS sorry left my caps on
OOS 30 at the moment, but haven't run many yet
OOS we are doing well right now
OOS wait
OOS diameter and flywheel thickness
OOS try bore diamter of 40
OOS yeah increasing D changes mass by an enormous amount, like change of five adds 5 to ms
OOS group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
OOS If I hold my variables same, the lower the diameter, the lower the Ms and fos
OOS 1.25?
OOS updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
OOS both, becaus FOS is pretty low too
OOS I can increase my mass toi 0.75 and my Fos to 24.38
OOS Do you need any dimensions from me?
OOS and your mass?
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS (D) piston bore
OOS and our mass so high
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS done
OOS agreed
OOS 15886.04
OOS I'm at lowest mass for 55 bore diameter. I can step down to 47.5 bore diameter and that might help
OOS I can sacrifice some fos if it will take off a lot of mass
OOS grp-im done
OOS okay
OOS Check for broadcast now
OOS my part doesnt effect mass very much
OOS Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
OOS Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
OOS Bore diameter according to the piston is 40 mm
OOS Yeah, FOS hasn't been an issue for me, it's just mass is way too high
OOS D is min at 40 I think
OOS Let me know what flywheel thicknesses and flywheel shaft diamters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
OOS what numbers are u running
OOS but mine is flywheel, wont get any lower
OOS thanks
OOS I dont believe so
OOS okay I'll keep lowering it
OOS using r2= .5 r3=.2
OOS Fos decrease like 2-3
OOS yeah
OOS What mass are you at?
OOS Yeah, my fos is minimized as well
OOS damn
OOS My best values on both charts have c=60 in common
OOS I have it low as possible
OOS what is your bore diameter now?
OOS i'm asking around rn
OOS does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you?
OOS increase it to 50
OOS Hi! I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me
OOS ?
OOS the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS ok same
OOS Alright, I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design, so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens
OOS Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
OOS Piston bore diameter?
OOS nobody touch anything haha
OOS 4000
OOS ok
OOS We need FS to increase now
OOS I still see 40
OOS Still 40mm. Will increasing bore help your design?
OOS Currently the Piston Bore Diameter is 40
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS ya, try 75
OOS currently working with them
OOS Whats your mass and Fos?
OOS Do you know who controls those factors?
OOS everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
OOS lets take bets on who goes rogue
OOS was that you?
OOS ok what about mass?
OOS cool
OOS 0.55
OOS the one i'm at now is the best one there is on the list
OOS just as a reference
OOS thanks! :)
OOS what is yours?
OOS What inputs do you need for calculating the diameter, if any?
OOS piston-pin is not responding
OOS okay i just put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
OOS mm
OOS What is our piston Bore?
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS but stil m=3.48
OOS The greater the values for either of those, the greater the FOS and mass
OOS GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
OOS 1.35 i mean
OOS We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
OOS now it's back ?? idk
OOS Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
OOS for mass?
OOS can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
OOS Brendan
OOS unless it drastically changes the mass
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS me neither, poor now
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS The global variables are giving our current FOS is 0.57 so I think we need to maximize that
OOS _|_|_
OOS Try 15
OOS if we can do that it cuts my mass to 1.24
OOS So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably
OOS Thank you
OOS you next?
OOS we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
OOS alright, I can get 2.77 with that value for D, Do you plan on changing D?
OOS I agree. My part increases in weight linearly and increases in FOS exponentially so its probably better to maximize it. Do you have a part that increases in FOS only linearly? you can see it on the graphs
OOS Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS how do they affect the mass and safety factor
OOS I'm happy with my numbers, but if you need to change something I will compensate
OOS See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
OOS For the current bore diameter, yes. If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results
OOS dwhat is your current piston bore diameter?
OOS Yeah I'm talking to the crankshaft
OOS They just told me their FOS is very high
OOS I will ask others
OOS fos went up
OOS for my component
OOS same 60 is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now
OOS what's your fos
OOS crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
OOS can we submit now?
OOS let me reduce the D to 40
OOS What is your FS
OOS we are pretty close
OOS Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
OOS ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
OOS tf increases mass...
OOS we are in excellent rn
OOS message back when you did it
OOS Perfect
OOS yall stay at where you are
OOS or we were for a second
OOS 2.83
OOS okay
OOS flywheel would...
OOS Go fast theyre giving out the money
OOS Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
OOS piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
OOS My current fos is 5625.56
OOS sure
OOS at the top it says round 2
OOS Wanna call it?
OOS So is there any tradeoff at all?
OOS yea it was perfect a minute ago
OOS ill go with a ratio of 4 so 900 for connector length
OOS yeah, told him to reduce it to save some weight
OOS yeah
OOS End experiment, nice worK!
OOS If you make it bigger, mass goes up and fos as well?
OOS how do i checkt that
OOS My design includes r2 and r3, do those affect yours at all?
OOS i did
OOS As long as your fos is above 2, try to find the lowest possible mass
OOS try to get the mass down below 40
OOS I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
OOS Our mass keeps going up
OOS record your current value
OOS alright
OOS What is your range of fos?
OOS Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
OOS try to decrease you mass while keeping a FOS above 2
OOS Literally, there is not
OOS Is 70 the best value for bore design or have you not messed with it yet?
OOS yeah
OOS i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
OOS diameter is 80
OOS I think its cause when anyone else changes their numberss it effects the other numbers
OOS know whats our next challenge
OOS were at fair now
OOS but im stillsuspicious
OOS nope!
OOS gotcha, try 85 then
OOS Nope
OOS ...
OOS how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
OOS If you reduce FOS to around 2, can we reduce weight?
OOS What is the factor of safety of the connecting rod at the moment?
OOS I think i have my ideal broadcast
OOS *max
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS the flywheel apparently only has a mass of 1.27
OOS Who depends on your variables?
OOS Do you have piston bore diameter?(D)
OOS Mass increases, but only by about 1kg at most and FoS increases by about 4
OOS I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
OOS I remember the parameter I had
OOS 6.72
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS dc is crank-pin diameter
OOS No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
OOS wait i wonder if the third guy is against the wall too
OOS I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
OOS no one depends on mine either
OOS Hello
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
OOS yep i got it
OOS Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
OOS I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
OOS are you making any changes  ?
OOS im at what ive always been at
OOS yeah agreed, it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect, so im going to stick to maximizing FOS
OOS now it says 2.03
OOS Hahaha wow
OOS So we are in good range right now
OOS Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
OOS GROUP: keep communicating!
OOS Okay
OOS is your FOS 1.79?
OOS it's just good
OOS current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
OOS is flywheel talking>
OOS Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
OOS its as small as itll go
OOS im trying 90 mm
OOS ok who will my t_h or piston head thickness affect?
OOS I'm trying to find out what everyone's FS is. crankshafter has theirs at 3.62
OOS Just D
OOS and the Flywheel shaft diameter to be 15
OOS so keep playing with your parameters and ill let you know how it impacts me
OOS do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS Oh yeah okay.
OOS ok the lower you have it the higher my Fos
OOS I think someone's trying to get excellent
OOS thickness = 8
OOS my friend offered to help tho so we may be able to fix ours
OOS what are the other variables you need?
OOS have you considered using 75?
OOS I didnt change anything
OOS is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
OOS cant decrease it anymore, its at 40
OOS so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high FOS
OOS Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
OOS We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
OOS yea we're at excellent
OOS yes, they are active
OOS can you get that FOS up?
OOS Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
OOS FS is good just decrease mass
OOS Have you broadcasted anything recently?
OOS we are at very good right now
OOS (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
OOS hi
OOS I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
OOS tell them that!
OOS Group: I will decrease mine now
OOS yes
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS I mean Fs only needs to be greater than 2
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
OOS i still have my two best broadcasted
OOS I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS yep
OOS Thats great, any way you can reduce weight more then?
OOS do you control piston bore diameter?
OOS If i increase diameter we go over weight. Still on lowest setting
OOS lower increases my mass and FOS
OOS Piston diameter
OOS the weight increased for some reason
OOS *mine
OOS What testbed variables do you have?
OOS _IXI_
OOS It still says .51 and he said that was for the team and that I couldn't see my own. I don't know if that makes sense though??
OOS is your fos 0.09 now?
OOS me too
OOS honestly the best bet for me would be a fos of above two and make the smallest weight possible
OOS rn i have a 90 mm diameter
OOS my fos is max right now at 1.23 and m of 0.07
OOS I reduced the diameter to 40mm to reduce the mass of the system
OOS Got and idea for the flywheel thickness?
OOS didnt change anything
OOS i guess it's good
OOS not me
OOS also which FS are you broadcasting
OOS No I do flywheel diameter
OOS i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
OOS 1.48, my mass is so small im just trying to increase my fos
OOS Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
OOS "This crankshaft is so broke I can hear it asking me for money"
OOS what's your mass and fos when diameter of 70mm is used?
OOS What testbed variables do you have?
OOS we are 1.94 over mass rn
OOS my part maintains FOS=2.06
OOS _|X|_
OOS try to decrease mass while keeping FOS over 2
OOS i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
OOS Sick, our engine is now excellent
OOS is that your ideal dim?
OOS did any mass values change?
OOS make sure you update the global broadcast
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS no
OOS whats the corresponding fos?
OOS $$$$$
OOS ya we can always change it too
OOS yes
OOS are you the conrod designer
OOS ds is 20
OOS increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
OOS should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall
OOS We need to save weight
OOS K, what is your weight?
OOS looks like we're done?
OOS _|_|O
OOS Is the mass significantly increased?
OOS good work
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS our weight is the high bit
OOS th, D, m, fos
OOS I'm gonna switch down to 47.5 diameter for a sec and see what happens. I can increase FOS a bunch by doing that and only add a small bit of mass
OOS How is your design coming along, do you need any data from me?
OOS it's corrected
OOS I'm using 85 so my mass now is 6.72
OOS My bad that wasn't clear, I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high FOS to begin with
OOS yeah
OOS getting close
OOS mine only goes up to 30 max
OOS ya, seems like we have agreement on that
OOS Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
OOS Should we do 75 for D or not so low
OOS what is your mas and fos?
OOS yeah
OOS Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
OOS Group: no more changes!
OOS group: who wants to go next?
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS try getting fos above 3 without increasing mass too much
OOS Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
OOS Hello, what variables do you have control over?
OOS what are your ranges?
OOS Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS my time is up
OOS basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
OOS got it
OOS what values do you have control over?
OOS I dunno
OOS report weight
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS Yes please!
OOS ok
OOS *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
OOS mine is 29
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS could yo slightly lower your diamter again?
OOS i havent changed
OOS Nope
OOS .45-5
OOS what variable do you control?
OOS Nevermind
OOS okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
OOS mine: ms 1.07, fos 35.82
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS Great Work
OOS yeet
OOS so close
OOS It showed very good and I haven't changed anything since then.
OOS or maybe two or three are tied
OOS nope!
OOS flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
OOS Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
OOS t = 10
OOS what is the range for your mass values?
OOS Ok
OOS did you get FOS as 1.81?
OOS new c is broadcast
OOS there
OOS ask
OOS currently with the rod designer
OOS what is the range of values you can choose?
OOS Do you know where our low Fos is coming from?
OOS do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
OOS mines at 3.84
OOS rip too late
OOS The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
OOS I can minimize my diameter
OOS Is there anything related to an increase/decrease in mass/fos on your end?
OOS flywheel, are you good?
OOS ok
OOS You're right!
OOS ok so if you increase C my fos goes down but weight is not effected
OOS Are you broadcasting
OOS woo!
OOS getting close
OOS DONT CHANGE
OOS I think we should go with 40
OOS whats your fos at for current settings
OOS D = 75
OOS Are you broadcasting that?
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS who many rounds do we getr?
OOS my FOS is 2.01
OOS Yeah they said they're not going to change it now
OOS Flywheel prob
OOS he won't respond to me
OOS what is your diameter?
OOS ok.
OOS d back to 10 now because fos is high
OOS 1.64
OOS Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
OOS or global?
OOS I see
OOS Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
OOS hello
OOS I haven't changed a thing
OOS the final isnt cumulative tho
OOS mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
OOS how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
OOS Did you change your broadcast by anychance?
OOS mine is currently 2.16 so I'll cut that a little closer
OOS Has yours updated yet?
OOS What can you change that increases your FOS?
OOS D = 90 for now
OOS What is your piston bore diameter?
OOS we should aim for a smaller total mass, it's a little close to 40
OOS OK STOP
OOS Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
OOS and go max
OOS alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
OOS even in the case by case basis, the higher the FOS the better
OOS alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
OOS unless you change that at all?
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
OOS it was onlt for a sec
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS I know, but the weight is higher for my other options above 2
OOS what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
OOS Do you need any parameters from me ?
OOS Piston Bore I am currently working with is 55mm
OOS No I'm using the crankshaft bearing offset
OOS record your current value
OOS flyweel is good too
OOS no I got my best value
OOS what is your mass/fos
OOS What is your FS
OOS Flywheel isn't communicating thats the problem
OOS no
OOS does that work well for you?
OOS definitely try and get your FOS up!
OOS yep
OOS try to increase your FS
OOS yeah it sucked
OOS okay sweet
OOS oh damn mine is 0~0.06 when i put diameter as 50
OOS Nope, mass = 1.27, fos_s=13238
OOS I'm good too
OOS those are my values
OOS it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on
OOS ?
OOS 75 mm is the bore diameter
OOS Are you currently changing values?
OOS lets just try getting our mass down
OOS oh I see
OOS That would be my guess too.
OOS it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
OOS Havent heard back from piston though
OOS We've got far too much mass at the moment overall
OOS yeah
OOS Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness?
OOS I'm going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it
OOS im trying to figure out who has the min FOS
OOS diameter is 25 mm
OOS what is your ms?
OOS make sure it's broadcasting propperyly, I've had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all
OOS alright I will try and reduce the mass
OOS so all the values you get are assuming max piston bore diameter?
OOS That's the minimum
OOS increasing it will increase the force on the connecting rod
OOS Do you know whose FOS is the lowest at the moment?
OOS The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
OOS hello
OOS no i do not
OOS Do you still have your diameter at maximum?
OOS okay sweet
OOS 2
OOS Oh wait we hit excellent
OOS As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
OOS piston guy controls it
OOS were in good range rn
OOS well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
OOS By how much would be good for you?
OOS so for you design a lower c is better?  does dc affect yours at all?
OOS quality just went down to poor for me. seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything?
OOS I change it to 80 now
OOS Hi
OOS hello
OOS It looks a little better now
OOS ok
OOS ok back to very good i say leabe it
OOS 1.92
OOS No, you?
OOS Have you chosen a crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS Mass: 1.75 FOS:6.07
OOS Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
OOS ggs
OOS try and use 60 for C
OOS nice
OOS we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
OOS 2.06
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS *?
OOS _|O|O
OOS 1.3 and mass is too high
OOS ok that's good
OOS So we can keep it low
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS first day on the job or something?
OOS .06 and 2.62
OOS can you cut the mass by any chance?
OOS good stick with that
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department.  Let's reduce mass.
OOS I can hold mine above 2 and reduce but me having a high FOS might brign the overall up for not much more mass
OOS I do the control ds but its the same
OOS I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
OOS are you broadcasting new values?
OOS i did it.  Looks a little closer but not quite there
OOS lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that
OOS Our FOS went up
OOS niceee haha
OOS Who changed it
OOS agree
OOS if I increase the offset, mass increases
OOS itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
OOS Ok, just making sure, thanks
OOS q5: is it a windshield wiper
OOS do you know what's going on?
OOS do you need r2 or r3?
OOS agreed
OOS ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
OOS Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
OOS 70
OOS hey the flywheel guy needs some info from you
OOS we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
OOS everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
OOS Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
OOS who went down in weight?
OOS If you increase the piston bore diameter (D) it increases my FOS
OOS 0.53 is the mass of my piston currently
OOS fake
OOS yup just got that, asked piston to lower his mass. Just to see
OOS Or rather, what affects it
OOS What are you working on?
OOS what is your mass/fos
OOS Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
OOS don't put it at whatever it was at for when it read excellent
OOS i have 1.27
OOS no nothing affects me
OOS sweet
OOS dont move
OOS Now Im at good. weights a bit high but FOS is right on
OOS great job
OOS okay thats nothing
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS they said they didnt change it
OOS I am updating my pin now to get a FOS of about 2.1 and reduce the mass
OOS No, i dont think so. I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter 
OOS increasing the bore diameter will increase the factor of safety as well as increase weight
OOS do you control piston bore diameter?
OOS Okay, do you know who is making the FOS so low?
OOS sure
OOS did you try playing around with bearing offset ?
OOS Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
OOS I think that is a good idea
OOS what are yous mass/fos
OOS 0.57
OOS I have the piston set to near lowest mass (m=0.69 and fos = 3.84) sending this to everyone
OOS Am broadcasting 150 and 50
OOS did any mass values change?
OOS not me
OOS so its fine
OOS sounds good
OOS Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS tf is 10
OOS Ok, I will try that now
OOS ratio for piston pin length to piston diameter
OOS not me
OOS i havent broadccasted anything new
OOS What are your design variables currently?
OOS Piston diameter of 75
OOS c = 85 dc = 15
OOS mass 1.24
OOS so nevermind haha
OOS Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
OOS Yes, mass minimization is quite useless on my end, as my values are 0.02 - 0.12
OOS piston is0.91
OOS m = 0.12 with f at 3.44
OOS i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk
OOS ok
OOS hello
OOS Hello, What parameters do you need from me
OOS Fos = 1215
OOS on your list,
