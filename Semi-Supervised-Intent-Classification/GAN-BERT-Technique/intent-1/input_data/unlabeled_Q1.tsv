fine_label utterance
UNK_UNK I see it
UNK_UNK mine still says fair
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK yeah it does but all of the fos have been over 2 except one of them
UNK_UNK I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
UNK_UNK i am using 60 rn
UNK_UNK okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
UNK_UNK Someone picked an FS of 0.51
UNK_UNK do you depend on t1 or r1?
UNK_UNK I also have a second parameter that increases fos and mass if I increase that
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK Have you made any progress on the piston diameter D?
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos?
UNK_UNK I have around 10
UNK_UNK 2.06
UNK_UNK reply when done
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK I think the FOS shown is the lowest FOS of ours
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK you should probably ask him/her
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK ok we are good
UNK_UNK Mine is 3.96
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK my subsystem FOS is reporting in the thousands ?
UNK_UNK 0.11
UNK_UNK but were at v good
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK whats your mass at the moment
UNK_UNK The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by 0.03
UNK_UNK can you share all your variables
UNK_UNK depends
UNK_UNK yeah, leave yours in a safe config
UNK_UNK rn is very
UNK_UNK do you have any variable that seems to relate to them?
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK Oh no
UNK_UNK What is your mass? I can increase FOS but I can't decrease mass much more. its only .5
UNK_UNK i don't think either of those affect me
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK m=0.07 FOS=1.23
UNK_UNK I think there is but I don't know how.
UNK_UNK does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
UNK_UNK alriight
UNK_UNK So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers?
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK FOS is back i increased thickness
UNK_UNK almost had ya
UNK_UNK What affects your mass the most?
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK Do you need any information from me?
UNK_UNK I have 3.03 with mass of 0.12.
UNK_UNK now mass is 1.18
UNK_UNK 1.31
UNK_UNK Try lowering your weight
UNK_UNK woah were at poor now
UNK_UNK Are you good with the results?
UNK_UNK I'll be on it
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK We were at exceelent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK The input crank-shaft bearing support offset
UNK_UNK it is yeah
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK great - please leave it there
UNK_UNK My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
UNK_UNK mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK No i do not!
UNK_UNK it still doesnt
UNK_UNK No, it should still be at 40mm
UNK_UNK m = 0.16, fos = 4.66
UNK_UNK yea it is
UNK_UNK also decreases my fos
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK negative
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK stop changing
UNK_UNK totally unsure what 4 simulations you mean
UNK_UNK and we've reached the global requirements
UNK_UNK Awesome
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK my mass is less than 2, who has the biggest contribution?
UNK_UNK 9193
UNK_UNK i havent changed anything
UNK_UNK how much weight can you trim (generally)
UNK_UNK it doesnt have to be that high
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK mine is currently m=0.02 and FOS=0.22 but my max FOS is 0.24
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK thickness is 10
UNK_UNK so I'm thinking the FOS of the system is the lowest FOS of any individual subsystem, can you try to increase FOS?
UNK_UNK Where is your FOS at?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK oh okay.
UNK_UNK no i do not
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK let me know what you think crank bearing offset (c) will be
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK it doesnt matter if youre not the min FOS
UNK_UNK what's the diameter you're using?
UNK_UNK from when it was at excellent
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK I do not believe so
UNK_UNK FOS just went down
UNK_UNK m= 3.46 fos=0.3
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK yep raised it
UNK_UNK Maybe not
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK Is it good to be maximized or minimized?
UNK_UNK Don't change anything!
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK can you raise fos still?
UNK_UNK oof
UNK_UNK Keeping it 45!
UNK_UNK ive got a FOS of 3.91, lets see if we can get it further above 2
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Our FOS just dropped a ton
UNK_UNK increases
UNK_UNK yes, an old version, I'm running the simulations you requested noe
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset (c)
UNK_UNK let shoot for smaller then
UNK_UNK Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction!
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK Please let me know if you change the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK sure give me a second
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK If I increase flywheel the thickness, and diameter, the mass increases, but the FOS decreases.
UNK_UNK I know its weird
UNK_UNK gave me dimensions earlier
UNK_UNK My part only accounts for only 0.1 so I can't do much for mass
UNK_UNK it's my best option
UNK_UNK Hello, what is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK how do we submit?
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK It's the smae tradeoff for everyone
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK Do u depend on the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK to give the same factor of saftey and reduced weight
UNK_UNK Yeah one sec
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK leave yours as is for now, piston is biggest factor rn
UNK_UNK what values work best for you
UNK_UNK The FOS is 2.03, so there are no improvements available
UNK_UNK okay perfect
UNK_UNK What values do you need?
UNK_UNK yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel
UNK_UNK Idon't have that information, but check the front page of your packet
UNK_UNK is there any way you can increase fos
UNK_UNK man 0.09 fos lol
UNK_UNK if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an FOS of over 2 that chould do it
UNK_UNK Working with you and piston as well
UNK_UNK so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK have you figure out how D effects ur numbers
UNK_UNK if you increase the diameter, the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease
UNK_UNK what diameter are you using
UNK_UNK No, do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK i see that
UNK_UNK currenty 2.03, but that can be raised.
UNK_UNK Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK hmmm okay
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK nice nice
UNK_UNK whats your FOS if you dropped mass by 3kg
UNK_UNK i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
UNK_UNK it is the smallest it can be
UNK_UNK alright yeah, I'm at lowest possible mass (0.1) and fos is 2.77
UNK_UNK yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good
UNK_UNK 0.28
UNK_UNK we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
UNK_UNK fair, that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase FOS, I'll decrease mass
UNK_UNK can you change it to 150?
UNK_UNK i did try it a few minutes ago, did anythjing change? Ill try it again
UNK_UNK minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK That's alright, as long as we have a FOS above 2
UNK_UNK still 45
UNK_UNK Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
UNK_UNK quality looks very good so idk?
UNK_UNK what variables are you considering?
UNK_UNK yeah i cant change anything. We done?
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK my projected outputs changed now im at m 1.14 and fos1.32
UNK_UNK I have a high FOS for everywhere in my combination of ranges
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK flywheel boi is tryna improve
UNK_UNK c was changed to 80
UNK_UNK or crankshaft
UNK_UNK Do you need dc?
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK but you might have to reduce mass
UNK_UNK no have not plugged in any new values
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK then it was not me
UNK_UNK same lmao
UNK_UNK who is this?!
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you!
UNK_UNK Can you do 20?
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK sweeeeeet
UNK_UNK Mine is at 2.05
UNK_UNK 2.95 is my minimum, I can't go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Our FOS dipped again
UNK_UNK if i can increase diameter and thickness in a similar ratio, both mass and fos increase
UNK_UNK acceptable weight now
UNK_UNK Im at 12 60 now.
UNK_UNK like a higher c
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK I had an excellent quality, but with someone's new broadcast, it's not poor
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK Keep your FOS above 2
UNK_UNK no I do not think it does, I was able to get my FOS up above 3.4 though
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK 2.26 and 2.5
UNK_UNK but ive decided im gonna focus more on 352 bc its a heavier weighted class
UNK_UNK Yeah still at 40 just made thickness smaller
UNK_UNK Hey whats the Fs for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK Ok. We need to try to decrease mass
UNK_UNK im at 75
UNK_UNK we did hit both requirements at one point
UNK_UNK ranges from0.45 to 4.43
UNK_UNK yea and increase FOS
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK Try to lower it to 2
UNK_UNK I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the fos
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS > 2?
UNK_UNK under variables of other subsystems
UNK_UNK when D is max
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK Our factor of safety is greater than 2, which is excellent 
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK Ok. I just updated my settings to be m=0.02 and FOS=0.22
UNK_UNK mas- 1.23 fos- 12.2k
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK what's your fos right now with 70mm diameter?
UNK_UNK same here, any small decrease in mass lowers FOS by a lot for me
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop mass more
UNK_UNK and FOS?
UNK_UNK ok, increasing the diameter will decrease my mass and my factory of safety
UNK_UNK yep just did it
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK though I might switch to 75
UNK_UNK on the projector
UNK_UNK what is the thickness you have on that right now with a d=15?
UNK_UNK My max is only 0.24 but I can increase it to 0.22 while only adding 0.01 mass
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK but D has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve FOS
UNK_UNK my current value is c = 150 and dc = 45
UNK_UNK Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
UNK_UNK Only way to get higher fos at 1.32 is to raise weight to 1.14
UNK_UNK yeah working on it now
UNK_UNK very good
UNK_UNK What is your mass?
UNK_UNK and how so?
UNK_UNK Yeah everything is going down now. Not sure why. I haven't chantged anything for like 10 mins.
UNK_UNK just barely above 2
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK Each part should be at 2
UNK_UNK I'll try it
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK good job!
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Yea, just a slight chance to fail
UNK_UNK Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK What are your current parameters?
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK The bore diameter as of right now is 55 I believe
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK my fos is 0.24
UNK_UNK is your fos still 5000 ish?
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK Ok I was at bearing support offset of 150 and crank-pin diameter of 43.8
UNK_UNK 82.5 is good
UNK_UNK no I don't need either
UNK_UNK It's getting better, keep it up
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK idk if it helps mass though. does it?
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK I think you need to reduce the mass a bit
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK Try for a FOS of 2 with minimum mass
UNK_UNK its the current broadcast..
UNK_UNK no, i mean 6.72
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK whats the name of the diameter?
UNK_UNK can you share your equations?
UNK_UNK i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK indeed
UNK_UNK I didn;t change
UNK_UNK or does it at all
UNK_UNK for my parts
UNK_UNK so you dont need anything fom me right?
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK hahah this is rough
UNK_UNK What's your FOS given the crankshaft bearing offset that the crankshaft has?
UNK_UNK nobody change anythibn
UNK_UNK i brought it down
UNK_UNK the program won't let me go any lower
UNK_UNK My individual mass is 1.27
UNK_UNK Have you changed your values any?
UNK_UNK ive got you at 75
UNK_UNK we need to lower our mass
UNK_UNK is diameter 90
UNK_UNK What is your third field you fill out to run simulations
UNK_UNK should we end?
UNK_UNK Ok. I now have FOS options over 1
UNK_UNK looks like we both need bore diameter from piston
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK now it's back ?? idk
UNK_UNK does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK the new design looks real good
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK What parameters can you change
UNK_UNK I think it's all coming from crankshaft. He doesnt seem to know whats going on
UNK_UNK No idea
UNK_UNK seems to be helping
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK we need FOS up a bit more now overall
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK thanks!
UNK_UNK yea my bad, I've got 7.15kg right now
UNK_UNK I think smaller
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75 to see what happens
UNK_UNK Not sure yet.
UNK_UNK I got a little better mass results
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK whats the lowest/highest mass and fos for you
UNK_UNK No, my FOS values are all greater than 300.
UNK_UNK 150 is lowest right?
UNK_UNK Sounds great to me
UNK_UNK Looks like moving from 90 up to 105 doesn't benefit me much in terms of the FoS/mass ratio
UNK_UNK a little someone else is messing around with their fos
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft
UNK_UNK Also I think a tf value of 10 is best
UNK_UNK What does it look like for you?
UNK_UNK I am having it at 40
UNK_UNK I'm pretty sure I will leave the thickness at 10 mm
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK I'll ask them
UNK_UNK My apologies, Plots were not showing up for me originally.  I'm on it
UNK_UNK good job team
UNK_UNK what value did you decide on? nothing updated on my screen
UNK_UNK Diameter = 40mm
UNK_UNK yes.  i think so
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK ok i did
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK Yeah, that's not on me.
UNK_UNK ok my m is .53 and fos is 1929
UNK_UNK Every 10 D I decrease from 70, mass decrease like 0.2-0.3
UNK_UNK Also, what is optimal in terms of parameters for you?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK fllywheel says their mass is 12708?
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK we can try smaller mass
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK how much mass is your part?
UNK_UNK yeap
UNK_UNK nothing actually
UNK_UNK What levels of mass are you dealing with?
UNK_UNK mine shows poor
UNK_UNK My fs is 2.27 and mass is 19.96
UNK_UNK Actually, that doesn't make any sense, since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is 150mm, and your maximum flywheel thickness is 51
UNK_UNK I am trying to change the piston thickness to reduce mass too
UNK_UNK nah dont do that
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK seems like lower was working better
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK yeah, what is fos?
UNK_UNK I've been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing D, but I haven't gotten any response.
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK decreasing mass is gonna decrease my fos
UNK_UNK 2.36
UNK_UNK you too!
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK was it D=75 that was giving us that low weight?
UNK_UNK yes, i design the c and dc
UNK_UNK actually we should be getting excellent
UNK_UNK .06 and 2.63
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK ah, change it back to 80 then?
UNK_UNK k, maybe not then
UNK_UNK lets try that
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK Do you need any parameters from me ?
UNK_UNK im at c is 90
UNK_UNK I'll try
UNK_UNK Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK Let's try to get all the other engineers to work on high FS even if masses are high
UNK_UNK is your current value exactly 90?
UNK_UNK it is best for me
UNK_UNK thickness 12 diameter 60
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK go back to what you had we were at good
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by 0.25
UNK_UNK currently 50
UNK_UNK So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea
UNK_UNK dont do that
UNK_UNK i gotchu
UNK_UNK Because everyone else is min mass
UNK_UNK Because they asked me for that
UNK_UNK I chose 40mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it's good for him or her if I use maximum value
UNK_UNK ms was 2.79
UNK_UNK if you increase though that increases mass
UNK_UNK by about .7 or 1
UNK_UNK total
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK Yeah its down to like .67 now
UNK_UNK Anyway you can reduce mass slightly
UNK_UNK yeah idk what
UNK_UNK we have excellent
UNK_UNK it's not set to the lowest atm
UNK_UNK good
UNK_UNK My FS is around 2. Some parts may just have different ranges
UNK_UNK What variables do you have listed under Key Design Variables? I have (D), (c), (tf), and (ds)
UNK_UNK increasing D increases my fos
UNK_UNK yeah...
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK Who is this?
UNK_UNK try not to change anything until you talk to someone
UNK_UNK anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the FOS too much?
UNK_UNK something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK its 3.24
UNK_UNK hey i think that made things better!
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK ok mine are c and dc will look into those
UNK_UNK with a FOS of 2.31
UNK_UNK 18.63 and fos = 2.06
UNK_UNK wait what did you change?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Did you just change something?
UNK_UNK but then
UNK_UNK can you try decreasing your mass?
UNK_UNK What is ds?
UNK_UNK weight is 0.86
UNK_UNK Not for a little bit. did something change for you?
UNK_UNK Mass is now 0.1
UNK_UNK does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
UNK_UNK im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
UNK_UNK then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and FOS
UNK_UNK More than 2 is excellent
UNK_UNK yeah i think she'll maybe even drop some hints about the exam..
UNK_UNK What's a good working piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK _I_I_
UNK_UNK ah, so when we broadcast we can overwrite
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK Ok, that's odd
UNK_UNK Ok. I can now get FOS of over 3 for .12 kg so it works well for me but if you need to change it I can try other settings
UNK_UNK what's your max mass?
UNK_UNK i can go lower but it'ss reduce fos
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK I've been talking with flywheel and he has very high mass ranges
UNK_UNK okay thats the most mass by far
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Lets not change it
UNK_UNK changed piston back to 40 mm
UNK_UNK it just became 0.13 though
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK 2 is for expecially good design
UNK_UNK But it's back to poor now again
UNK_UNK My current FOS is 7.69, what is yours?
UNK_UNK Trying to figure out what caused the spike in weight
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase?
UNK_UNK You good to leave
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK what diameter have you chosen?
UNK_UNK what you need and what you have
UNK_UNK and what are your numbers when you do that
UNK_UNK I can, my lowest mass with the 45 bore diameter is 0.11, fos for that is 2.95
UNK_UNK Bcause it changes other peoples FS properties
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK nah its above 35
UNK_UNK yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
UNK_UNK flywheel is 0.52 currently
UNK_UNK i asked
UNK_UNK so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK What do you currently have for your bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK yeah haha
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK i have a fos of 2.47
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia, 
UNK_UNK is our global FS just the lowest part FS?
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK cool thats good
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK (piston head)
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK ok still at 60
UNK_UNK cats game
UNK_UNK as long fos isnt below 2 keep it
UNK_UNK are the other people responding
UNK_UNK Hey, let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK makes it way worse
UNK_UNK only .7 away now
UNK_UNK smallest
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK How is the factor of safety
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos?
UNK_UNK refresh it
UNK_UNK now it dropped
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized rn
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK yeah i have no clue
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK What info do you have?
UNK_UNK Gott an idea for the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK okay okay
UNK_UNK same and im currently there
UNK_UNK see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
UNK_UNK Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK What's your FOS right now?
UNK_UNK How much does your part weigh?
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK true. what's your mass?
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK 0.05 kg
UNK_UNK higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
UNK_UNK Does a larger thickness negatively affect fos or mass?
UNK_UNK woof woof
UNK_UNK are you changing things rn
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK Sure.
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK ms: 1.71, fos: 4.55
UNK_UNK ok good. I would just assume your part has the most mass
UNK_UNK yep okay
UNK_UNK meant decrease thickness and lower the weight
UNK_UNK I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK sorry i wrote backwards, increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK Thanks. What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK Wait we've gone down to poor quality now
UNK_UNK do you have the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK If that reduces your fos
UNK_UNK I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it?
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK George?
UNK_UNK hey
UNK_UNK because it just skyrocketed
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott
UNK_UNK Hold where you are
UNK_UNK I think if you minimize the mass, we can work together to get a good factor of safety
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK I think my d_c makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
UNK_UNK that cant be right
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK m=3.48
UNK_UNK 27.44
UNK_UNK whats ur fos
UNK_UNK ah okk
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK yes. d from 20 to 15
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK Smallest number possible is best
UNK_UNK to do that should I lower r, which could lower our FOS too much
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK something happened to FOS
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK lets do 62.5
UNK_UNK D = 85, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK i  believe at least one member's part is too heavy
UNK_UNK _I_I_
UNK_UNK Good
UNK_UNK I'm not sure any of your variables affect the piston pin?
UNK_UNK wassup
UNK_UNK Okay, I'll play around with it
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK lol
UNK_UNK I have not touched mine
UNK_UNK what is your flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK so what might effect you is the diameter of the pin
UNK_UNK GOOD***
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK i updated
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK right now at 88 shows very good
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK The crankshaft changed something
UNK_UNK What weight are you at?
UNK_UNK Yo
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK are those variables L and r?
UNK_UNK piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK which you control
UNK_UNK Thats fine.
UNK_UNK going with the minimum to reduce mass because my FOS is so high
UNK_UNK how much does the fly wheel weigh?
UNK_UNK no keep it low
UNK_UNK make it higher
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK maybe? what is yours
UNK_UNK okay we need this FOS to go up
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK we had excelent at one point
UNK_UNK wanna shoot for excellent? :P
UNK_UNK what's your FOS
UNK_UNK Good point, I could reduce my mass by .15 and the part will still be plenty strong
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK someone changed thier mass
UNK_UNK we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
UNK_UNK looks like mass dropped a lot
UNK_UNK slim if you can without chaning your fos
UNK_UNK yes, we need to system wide reduce weight
UNK_UNK yes, 75 works for me and piston
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK hmm ok
UNK_UNK we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
UNK_UNK what's your factor of safety currently
UNK_UNK What parameter do you control?
UNK_UNK im trying to broadcast with c=130
UNK_UNK we're good now
UNK_UNK I don't think so, all I need is piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I am working with 70 right now, but it will need adjusted.
UNK_UNK What value would be ideal for the flywheel?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK someones FOS is too low
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK For just the flywheel?
UNK_UNK 60mm
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK Did you change anything? fos just tanked
UNK_UNK please do
UNK_UNK hey whats the crank length?
UNK_UNK I just followed up with him
UNK_UNK i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
UNK_UNK Crap. I wish it would update automaticly
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK In my simulation I increased Tf to 51. It brought the fos down ever so slightly, but brought down the mass by 2 kg for some reason
UNK_UNK since if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK Something just took a hit. Any idea what changed?
UNK_UNK its 4821.91
UNK_UNK 17.5 would be great, lowers mass a ton
UNK_UNK if you get it lower than 2.0, you can try adding some mass, it's ok.
UNK_UNK Great - thanks
UNK_UNK What are your values now?
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Its at very good
UNK_UNK no I just asked piston pin guy
UNK_UNK hmm ok I'll check around
UNK_UNK I'm ending it
UNK_UNK well the grade scale shows that a total mass below 2 should be possible
UNK_UNK min fos = .38, max fos 1.32
UNK_UNK What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK You dont need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
UNK_UNK any preference on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK What are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK Hello, I am currently trying to solve for the piston-pin length, and I need the piston bore diameter (D). Do you happen to have this value?
UNK_UNK Can you broadcast a design with c as 130?
UNK_UNK gotta love it
UNK_UNK ya go ahead and change it back, can you lower D any more?
UNK_UNK Isnt our fos about which part has the lowest?
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?\
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK I have t1, L, and r
UNK_UNK My current fos in my table is 1.11
UNK_UNK FOS coz that's minimum
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK Did you broadcast that
UNK_UNK ok sweet
UNK_UNK my best was 1.67 at a bore diameter of 45
UNK_UNK i was trying to see which design was better
UNK_UNK what do you control and what do you need
UNK_UNK I have my best values broadcast with .12kg and FOS=3.44
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK were at very good rn
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK 20.86 (mass of .6)
UNK_UNK if we could decrease for another 2 kg we should get excellent
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK now it's back ?? idk
UNK_UNK I will change to 70
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK then we will see how the fos changes
UNK_UNK Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
UNK_UNK if i go all the way to min weight is cuts fos and only shaves .03kg
UNK_UNK 51 and 1.1 my values keep getting messed up
UNK_UNK I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK Yep just got paid
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK this is as good as i can get i think
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK That's odd, I don't have either of those variables
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK yea as low it gets my FOS shoots up
UNK_UNK The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK tf = 22 and ds = 49
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK ok yeye
UNK_UNK truuu
UNK_UNK did you change something after excellent
UNK_UNK New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
UNK_UNK ill choose a word
UNK_UNK New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
UNK_UNK Will do I wrote them down
UNK_UNK we have excellent rn
UNK_UNK and i have leeway with my factor of safety
UNK_UNK Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value
UNK_UNK I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
UNK_UNK completely
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK HEllo
UNK_UNK GOOD***
UNK_UNK Hey, have you broadcasted your values?
UNK_UNK one second
UNK_UNK I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
UNK_UNK idk what im doing at the moment
UNK_UNK 2.16
UNK_UNK ok neither have i
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller? What about the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK the minimum it gives me is 150
UNK_UNK Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
UNK_UNK Sorry for the abrupt message
UNK_UNK right now it's 11.09
UNK_UNK try 40?
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK D is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Diameter = 40 mm
UNK_UNK Interesting, the mass is what is hurting us but the FOS is beautifull
UNK_UNK okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
UNK_UNK Ok, mine is only .5. Idk how fos works but mine goes above 5k
UNK_UNK okay, so let's try to get a high FS, as flywheel has huge masses, and they well work on mass reduction
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
UNK_UNK we have excellent quality right now
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12
UNK_UNK I think he influences it the most
UNK_UNK Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
UNK_UNK we're good now
UNK_UNK we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
UNK_UNK Can you improve FOS?
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK anyways ya ive given up on 375 but imma hang out in Hess's office starting next week
UNK_UNK what is your mass when you maximize your flywheel diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK Im still at poor quality... are you as well?
UNK_UNK Nice!
UNK_UNK Hey, I'm changing the piston diameter and the piston head thickness.  What parameters are you changing?
UNK_UNK I double checked the handout and yeah, it's only dependent on lower FOS
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK 85 right now, I was trying to optimize mass
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK Ok now it dropped
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
UNK_UNK I have my diameter set to 40, but that has likely changed since I last chacked
UNK_UNK So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
UNK_UNK what changed?
UNK_UNK Do you understand how it al fits together. I feel like we all only see that small snapshot of our component
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK Hello! what's the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
UNK_UNK yessir
UNK_UNK But I have the minimum fos so I'll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
UNK_UNK were at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK Oh ok mine just updated
UNK_UNK do you have tf?
UNK_UNK We got very good
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK I used 70mm. Try to update yours
UNK_UNK i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK 1.36
UNK_UNK what about thickness of flywheel?
UNK_UNK I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK someone changed a parameter
UNK_UNK no i don't think so
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK these are the same values I had for the "very good" design
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK no idea
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK back to very good
UNK_UNK My mass range is around 0.02 to .12
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK i think ive optimized my part
UNK_UNK one sec
UNK_UNK Currently is 21.49 for me, FoS is 1.74
UNK_UNK 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
UNK_UNK i haven't updated
UNK_UNK I reduced mine to the lowest value, and our FOS is good now
UNK_UNK im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
UNK_UNK everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
UNK_UNK 3.64
UNK_UNK I can reduce it by lowering diameter or thickness which lowers my FOS
UNK_UNK My part is at the lowest mass possible currently
UNK_UNK we gotta talk
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK 9.86
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK It looks like our engine design is excellent then. And yes that works with my design requirements
UNK_UNK my bad, thanks 
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK you said piston diameter is in your equation right?
UNK_UNK mass
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK is it each part or globally
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages.
UNK_UNK My design includes r2 and r3, do those affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK also what are your ds and tf values
UNK_UNK Its the lowest mass with an FOS above 2
UNK_UNK Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
UNK_UNK Yes. My current design has a mass of 0.53 and a Fs of 2.1
UNK_UNK nope mine has been at 1.27
UNK_UNK Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK ooooo it went down but so did FOS
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK All I need is the diameter
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK I feel like its the crankshaft guy, everyone else has high fos
UNK_UNK I think 75 is the best right now
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK hell yeah
UNK_UNK No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK thats an L
UNK_UNK did you make a change?
UNK_UNK what bore diameter are you thinking?
UNK_UNK no i don't need that
UNK_UNK What is the offset that is working well for you?
UNK_UNK yesss just the handfull of cash
UNK_UNK I can try and trim a little more tho]
UNK_UNK whats it to u
UNK_UNK that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
UNK_UNK rying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
UNK_UNK check
UNK_UNK okay, I'll try using that now
UNK_UNK reply when done
UNK_UNK could you make it larger?
UNK_UNK ill check
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK I think flywheel has the lowest fos
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK perfect. thank you
UNK_UNK my foss is 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
UNK_UNK 2880
UNK_UNK 11.3
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK a higher D increases the mass and FOS. With 85, my mass is 13.09 and FOS is 7.69
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Crankshaft bearing offset? I don't control that variable!
UNK_UNK What are you using as your diameter
UNK_UNK And the mass?
UNK_UNK Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass = 0.12 and FOS = 3.44
UNK_UNK so I have two variables
UNK_UNK no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK can you bring FOS down? it only needs to be 2
UNK_UNK current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
UNK_UNK piston- pin designer
UNK_UNK because if I go with 50, FOS would be too low
UNK_UNK ayyyyyy
UNK_UNK i need c, t_f, ds
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK okay we got excellent. we should be done here
UNK_UNK otherwise my FOS is below 1
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK 4
UNK_UNK what shaft diameter are you using
UNK_UNK yep, we need to lower the overall mass
UNK_UNK Will make it larger only if you need
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK what crankshaft offset is ideal for your design? I need it to design the flywheel
UNK_UNK got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
UNK_UNK keeping fos at 2
UNK_UNK hi, what are you working on?
UNK_UNK gotta be inclusive gosh
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK yeah I
UNK_UNK No I have not
UNK_UNK okay, so you part and my part are the heaviest
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
UNK_UNK No I do not, I would consult the piston
UNK_UNK m at 1.63, fos at 53.27
UNK_UNK Ah I see
UNK_UNK the fos went up from 4821 to 5625
UNK_UNK Alrighty. Just updated it
UNK_UNK I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK That's ok.  I control the conrod length to crank length ratio (r1), does that affect you in any way?
UNK_UNK yeah thats the totla
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK Flywheel would be the heaviest part
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK which do you need
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK wait in the complete range?
UNK_UNK 75 is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement
UNK_UNK Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
UNK_UNK try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin fos remains above 2
UNK_UNK actually sorry i cant go below 150
UNK_UNK What varibales do you need to consider?
UNK_UNK says very good
UNK_UNK so for me besides diameter, i can play around with two variables
UNK_UNK I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do
UNK_UNK So is there any tradeoff at all?
UNK_UNK just did it
UNK_UNK but our system FOS is 1.25
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK D, d_s, and t_f, but I don't know how to use those
UNK_UNK 85 right now
UNK_UNK what are your values
UNK_UNK Weigght!
UNK_UNK Not quite sure yet.
UNK_UNK We do
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK does your design depend on the flywheel at all?
UNK_UNK for some reason i cant go that low
UNK_UNK X|_|O
UNK_UNK im happy with that lol
UNK_UNK what I'm looking at is 60 and 12
UNK_UNK That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control
UNK_UNK right now
UNK_UNK Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
UNK_UNK thats good
UNK_UNK what piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK because the overall mass and FOS are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago, now they're horrible lol
UNK_UNK 4 for head thickness and 75 for piston diameter
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK try that
UNK_UNK c=150, dc=45
UNK_UNK the other values on our team are like between 2.5 and 5000
UNK_UNK really?
UNK_UNK 0.1 to 3.24 for mass, 1.72 to 54.23 for FS.
UNK_UNK we need less mass folks
UNK_UNK yes do that
UNK_UNK we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
UNK_UNK I don't think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from 40 to 70
UNK_UNK pretty close now actually
UNK_UNK what changed>
UNK_UNK q3: does it hav emoving parts
UNK_UNK your part seems pretty light how large can you make the FOS
UNK_UNK Lets see what happens?
UNK_UNK I have good for a design with thickness 10 and diameter 25
UNK_UNK so i dont want to change
UNK_UNK neither have we
UNK_UNK i do
UNK_UNK 47.5
UNK_UNK Yeah thats what I got
UNK_UNK What did you guys get
UNK_UNK can you try using 50 mm? and try to maximize the fos?
UNK_UNK literally dead lol - try to increase FOS
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK im also at 2 rn
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK are you still using D = 40?
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK No, I do not believe so
UNK_UNK 1.12
UNK_UNK the dream team
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK its the smallest I can go
UNK_UNK ds = 50
UNK_UNK And also the fos?
UNK_UNK Yeah for a second we were meeting both...I wonder what just updated?
UNK_UNK yeah uhhh that looks good. nice.
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the fos while minimizing its mass
UNK_UNK and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK mine is m=0.69 and fos = 3.84
UNK_UNK For D =85, what was your mass
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more
UNK_UNK yeah thats ok the fos for othee's will be less
UNK_UNK did you change the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK these are the variables I need to consider for design
UNK_UNK Can you do that? Right now its at 50
UNK_UNK what can you do with your diameter
UNK_UNK sitting at 2.77
UNK_UNK what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK that's at my minimum dimensions, I can't
UNK_UNK Yes, that's the minimum diameter I can use
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK There is no benefit for a FOS over 2
UNK_UNK c=150
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Yeah really
UNK_UNK ok i am not gonna change without letting yopu know
UNK_UNK what variables do you use?
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK we need to do better though lol
UNK_UNK i willl try decreasing dc
UNK_UNK the plot on the white board
UNK_UNK XIXIO
UNK_UNK i switched it back to 45
UNK_UNK your FOS is in the thousands????
UNK_UNK I am staying at m 0.07 and fs 1.23
UNK_UNK what is your fos
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK okay well we were at excellent and the other guys swear they didn't change anything lol
UNK_UNK Smaller works better for my FOS and Mass
UNK_UNK Yea, nvm we're good i think
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK nah, I assume you're talking about the piston bore diameter right?
UNK_UNK what variables do you control?
UNK_UNK Well the flywheel has a fos of 5625.56
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK and keep D lower
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK or avg
UNK_UNK okay. I think the value is not this.
UNK_UNK we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs
UNK_UNK aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click "check for broadcast"
UNK_UNK i updated another design
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK I think the 82.5 is the best. let me know when you are okay for me to change it back.
UNK_UNK I'll try
UNK_UNK fos is 1.92 and mass is 1.46
UNK_UNK 1.35
UNK_UNK Actually 2.83. read the wrong one
UNK_UNK the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK No mines the same
UNK_UNK mine is at the highest possible value
UNK_UNK It's 3.41
UNK_UNK X|_|o
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting the values giving that weight?
UNK_UNK who is this?!
UNK_UNK yeah they say they cant decrease it any more
UNK_UNK just did. .03kg
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK f_os = 9193.31
UNK_UNK piston told me
UNK_UNK Yo
UNK_UNK Hold where you are
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK i didnt
UNK_UNK ok i got fos 2.02 and mass of 5.82
UNK_UNK I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and fos
UNK_UNK it doesnt impact it much, and my part is low mass so if i have to change it, that wont be a big deal
UNK_UNK our FOS still needs to go up
UNK_UNK yes, that was what I was thinking
UNK_UNK q4: did we talk about it in our classes this semester?
UNK_UNK 55
UNK_UNK what is your current mass?
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK 12 for thickness
UNK_UNK im at 2.36
UNK_UNK does your design require any spesific value for piston diameter
UNK_UNK I've had it at the first one, but it says you may need my thickness to change
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK Sounds good. Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then
UNK_UNK kool
UNK_UNK 1.93 right now
UNK_UNK have you reached an ideal value for your part yet?
UNK_UNK What are your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK Whats your current diameter?
UNK_UNK cool, let us know if we should change the bore diameter
UNK_UNK I let the mknow
UNK_UNK how about you?
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK We need to increase FOS somehow
UNK_UNK For the diameter it is 25 right now
UNK_UNK oops sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK I asked the guy, he said it was normal
UNK_UNK aight bet
UNK_UNK best I get
UNK_UNK What is the mass of your components?
UNK_UNK That's good
UNK_UNK How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK yeah agreed
UNK_UNK do u know how many rounds we get?
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK same, i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK more like first hour
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK Alright.
UNK_UNK hey, whats the size of the piston bore?
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK 82.5 i was thinking, the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK i agree with that
UNK_UNK Ok. We need total to be less than 3. My part costs roughly 0.6 when combined with the piston-pin.
UNK_UNK 11.3
UNK_UNK mine is 2.09
UNK_UNK currently 0.06
UNK_UNK i know, my design is basically fixed
UNK_UNK 1.67
UNK_UNK but I can slightly increase mass to get 2.63 FOS
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you!
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK I dont think those effect my design. Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else
UNK_UNK about 12
UNK_UNK hows it going
UNK_UNK That's literally the lowest value i have that's above 2 though
UNK_UNK t_h is currently 2
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK yes, one minute on that
UNK_UNK i think so?
UNK_UNK What is your mass?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
UNK_UNK 40
UNK_UNK exellent dont toucu
UNK_UNK helloooo
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK lmao both of them?
UNK_UNK Ok with the minimum mass, for the flywheel, Fs is still 1215
UNK_UNK who are you
UNK_UNK mass/FOS?
UNK_UNK A bit. I can lower bore diameter
UNK_UNK 37.46 and 2.06
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK how much does the connecting rod currently weigh?
UNK_UNK Ok, I'll ask them if so and then we can go from there. That looks like a hard simulation to run.
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK is bore diameter piston diameter
UNK_UNK Hi what is the mass that you are currently using?
UNK_UNK no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
UNK_UNK we got it, don't change things
UNK_UNK Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
UNK_UNK Perfect!
UNK_UNK 0.87
UNK_UNK 40 inches.
UNK_UNK yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
UNK_UNK I have, at least on my screen.
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK What is your fos?
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK lets try only  small changes now since we are at very good, maybe make it to excellent
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK we have excellent quality right now
UNK_UNK I didn't change anything
UNK_UNK what happended to our FOS?
UNK_UNK my connecting rod length = 1/(crank length)
UNK_UNK I have the best broadcast available for my thing
UNK_UNK Can you change D?
UNK_UNK did you just change something?
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest mass possible
UNK_UNK maybe we should just call it good
UNK_UNK keep it up and we'll trim from there
UNK_UNK what is your offset right now
UNK_UNK go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
UNK_UNK What factors are you interested in?
UNK_UNK It was good for a second, what happened
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at good
UNK_UNK hey try changing the diameter to 90
UNK_UNK DONT CHANGE
UNK_UNK $2 missed
UNK_UNK 3.62
UNK_UNK Currently 3.2
UNK_UNK awesome, thanks
UNK_UNK FOS 2.06
UNK_UNK my fos is 2
UNK_UNK I think a lower D is better. something like a 75 was giving us a good weight
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK 27.44
UNK_UNK mass is .37
UNK_UNK it was just at very good, someone changed and it went up a lot
UNK_UNK select *
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK It's just updated, now mass is 3.11 and FOS is 2.07
UNK_UNK if any of your values changed go back to what it was
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK yeah the pin is pretty light, shouldnt be an issue
UNK_UNK lets gooo
UNK_UNK mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
UNK_UNK what mare mass values around an fos of 2
UNK_UNK try using 50 mm
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK bet
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK I am considering the piston diameter and the piston head thickness
UNK_UNK hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by .28
UNK_UNK *of mass
UNK_UNK if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
UNK_UNK did oyu change?
UNK_UNK Lower D works better for both me and the rod designer, do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK i have mass 1.27, FOS: 15886
UNK_UNK need: piston bore diamter
UNK_UNK its the flywheel guy
UNK_UNK Hey, what fos, do you think would be good enough, 1.5-2.25 ish?
UNK_UNK Mine are, but i have not made any drastic changes since. Your lowering of ds helped me shave off 2 more lbs
UNK_UNK U mean 0.672?
UNK_UNK r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
UNK_UNK we need smaller mass folks
UNK_UNK so it looks like our mass is killing us now
UNK_UNK 2.43 which is a bit high
UNK_UNK It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
UNK_UNK now im using diameter = 55 thickness 15
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Yeah I noticed the same thing
UNK_UNK what's your current piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Increase your mass slightly
UNK_UNK and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
UNK_UNK if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
UNK_UNK it's very good right now
UNK_UNK Yeah, I have not changed anything since my parameters were at the bounds of what I could input so I'll reach out to the other folks about it
UNK_UNK the simulation results for me show the subsystem fos
UNK_UNK do you have any variable that seems to match with those?
UNK_UNK ahh gotcha
UNK_UNK Global quality looking bad though
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK doesnt have to be ;)
UNK_UNK pretty sure its someone else
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK probably
UNK_UNK I'm now at 2.77, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK Will keep you updated
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK My bad, currently at best option. Lowest mass, higher Fos
UNK_UNK The conrod hasn't changed anything
UNK_UNK how did the mass increase by this much
UNK_UNK In the current broadcast, the value is 15
UNK_UNK gives excellent
UNK_UNK Okay try and change C
UNK_UNK do you rely on a c or a dc?
UNK_UNK try to find a good combination at D=40
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK gotchya thanks
UNK_UNK back at80
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK hmm, anything I can do to help reduce your mass?
UNK_UNK It's not me
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK mass is 0.54 and fos is 3286
UNK_UNK alright.
UNK_UNK I was testing the lower diameter for less mass. Changed it back now
UNK_UNK mass = 1.27 and f_os = 15886.04
UNK_UNK like my FS just went from 1.9 to 2.2 without me changin anything for my part
UNK_UNK Same.
UNK_UNK you done?
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK What are your two variables at
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK We did
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK what i was told
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.27 already
UNK_UNK the piston wont respond
UNK_UNK only *
UNK_UNK Check the top of the second page of the handout
UNK_UNK the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK I just saved mass changing tf to 30
UNK_UNK ya we just lowered it all the way, how are your numbers
UNK_UNK 60 mm
UNK_UNK currently my mass is 0.53
UNK_UNK I'm just doing what he tells me tbh
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK increasing D gives me a worse weight
UNK_UNK increases it
UNK_UNK Thanks :) I'll work with that for now, let me know if you end up making any final changes
UNK_UNK what is your fs?
UNK_UNK is it possible for that to go lower
UNK_UNK I think hes at fos 1.64 and mass of 2,26 but that was a while ago
UNK_UNK no - must be someone else I guess?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK What is your FOS and mass at currently?
UNK_UNK don't change
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK got it, hmmm
UNK_UNK Currently 2.95
UNK_UNK lmaaaooooo
UNK_UNK I dont have those variables on my diagrams, what do they represent?
UNK_UNK do you need it to be higher or  lower?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Is that the lowest mass setting without compromising fos
UNK_UNK Whats the best you can get with a bore diameter of 80?
UNK_UNK We're still seeing 80 as the globally broadcast value. Weird.
UNK_UNK so lmk if it stays at 150
UNK_UNK Nope things changed to the worst now
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK what is c?
UNK_UNK most of mass is in piston and flywheel
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK tandy
UNK_UNK i can do 40 easy
UNK_UNK okay, I'm going to try and change c
UNK_UNK yeah that is what im using
UNK_UNK the minimum mass I have while the FOS is above 2 is 5.45. I have made 14 simulations to justify the result.
UNK_UNK i have no clue whats happening with that. my mass is too low to have an impact
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK I currently have 10 for thickness and 17.5 for diameter
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, try reducing the mass
UNK_UNK okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK do you have the 1.65 fos?
UNK_UNK Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK Ok cool
UNK_UNK what is your current ds
UNK_UNK I havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK This is strange
UNK_UNK hah punnnnnnny
UNK_UNK mine are piston diameter and head thickness
UNK_UNK minimum mass that has FOS > 2
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK yup thats working!
UNK_UNK if you did you need to go back
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK its at very good
UNK_UNK yup
UNK_UNK Whats your mass and Fos?
UNK_UNK My FOS is at 2.29.
UNK_UNK Do you have any that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK The highest performance is at 3.91 FOS and 5.2M
UNK_UNK neato
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK agreed, we can still try to look for improvements
UNK_UNK no worries
UNK_UNK seems like the sim values FOS over weight as far as getting from "fair" to "good"
UNK_UNK crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
UNK_UNK what is the mass of your design?
UNK_UNK Can you change piston diamter without affecting your FOS and mass much? With the current diamteter my max FOS is only 0.51
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
UNK_UNK What is your range for diameter?
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK no we should go for excellent
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK Made diameter 75
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK whats your lower limit?
UNK_UNK 1.7 with bearing offset of 300
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK Yes, with that my FOS is now 2.17
UNK_UNK Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen
UNK_UNK Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
UNK_UNK 85 is the updated
UNK_UNK what are you working on?
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK The TA guy said its the lowest value between us
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK how about for fos
UNK_UNK My system FS is 2.05 atm
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK 1.71 (mass range: 1.13 to 3.12) and 4.55 (fos range: 4.55 to 0.44)
UNK_UNK for c = 85 dc = 15 ds = 25 tf= 30 D = 70 fos = 2.37
UNK_UNK crankshaft a lil suspicious too
UNK_UNK I will be using 40mm going forward
UNK_UNK okay we have very good again
UNK_UNK Yeah, the flywheel won't break, so i was just minimizing mass
UNK_UNK So far, the 90mm looked better than the 97.5mm
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Hey, I'm good for now, thanks. let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK That might not be worth it then
UNK_UNK i have to choose the heaviest part now
UNK_UNK Right now I'm using D = 85
UNK_UNK should I try to lean toward FS since my masses are about 1 to 4 and FS ranges are .5 to 3 ish?
UNK_UNK increase FS decrease mass of the connecting rod
UNK_UNK we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
UNK_UNK I think its the piston changing but not sure
UNK_UNK awesome fos
UNK_UNK ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
UNK_UNK im so confused what happened
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK does a larger diameter increase your mass? or decrease it?
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK yeah, I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can
UNK_UNK adjust which part?
UNK_UNK what, the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK chat with piston pin to determine that
UNK_UNK mine says 4.26 and 0.6
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
UNK_UNK FOS is 2.85
UNK_UNK Im at 2nd lowest mass
UNK_UNK what mass are you working with?
UNK_UNK its the flywheel guy
UNK_UNK Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness
UNK_UNK Sounds good.  I'll try to decrease shaft mass
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK correct
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK ok yeah so really small. I was just wondering why mass was so high
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK for m=3.48
UNK_UNK thanks, can you try increasing it to around 97.5 or something, Im trying to see how it effects my numbers
UNK_UNK I havent updated anything, so it was either crankshaft or connecting rod
UNK_UNK D =75
UNK_UNK bark
UNK_UNK D=75, m = 1.36, fos = 2.85
UNK_UNK We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable
UNK_UNK and thickness
UNK_UNK what's your design variables?
UNK_UNK We are compromising mass
UNK_UNK I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
UNK_UNK I havent updated anything
UNK_UNK LOWER YOUR FOS
UNK_UNK did you just increase your mass?
UNK_UNK I think that is an average of each designer's parts which is why I think someone's dimensions aren
UNK_UNK minimize it if you can while keeping fos as close to 2 as possible
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Let's try 75
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK I cannot bring that down too much farther as Fs is at 2.1
UNK_UNK the piston wont respond to me
UNK_UNK global is at 2.47, individual is 15886.04
UNK_UNK No. Mine is 2.36
UNK_UNK I had it at m = 0.04 and f = 0.74 when the status of the engine was good
UNK_UNK Yes, I want to minimize mass but also don't want the piston head to fail
UNK_UNK are you changing things
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK alright, just get FOS to right above 2 and that'll have to do
UNK_UNK Do you have an option of an FOS of at least 1?
UNK_UNK 2.31
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better for you if I use greater value
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK do you need me to change my thickness or anything like that? changing my thickness only affects my mass by 1.5 kg max if it helps you out with mass
UNK_UNK currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
UNK_UNK Mine are flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK mass = 11.09
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm leaving mine as is for now. Trying to figure out why our total mass is so high.
UNK_UNK i do not
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK piston is about to update me with D. I need it to be low too. How about you
UNK_UNK The piston has a diameter of 75
UNK_UNK I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts. I dont need them, fos = 0.71 now
UNK_UNK I need to change D to 85 though
UNK_UNK mass went up quite a bit on my end
UNK_UNK someone touched it
UNK_UNK make sure crank shaft guy knows that and try to figure out how an increase or decrease in that effect the FOS and the mass
UNK_UNK ???
UNK_UNK Well you've got the crankshaft, it should be the heaviest
UNK_UNK nice. So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
UNK_UNK are you chaning values and updating your broadcast?
UNK_UNK Thanks, I'm good on my end. Is there anything you need from my end?
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK What's your system mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK my mass = 6. im guessing connecting rod?
UNK_UNK is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you?
UNK_UNK i think we should just leave it
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK Hi, please keep me updated on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK mas is up pretty high
UNK_UNK FOS is good. Mass is 10kg too high
UNK_UNK the systemwide weight is kinda high
UNK_UNK I need a bore of at most 48
UNK_UNK i can't go lower than this
UNK_UNK that makes sense.  i just maxed my fos right now
UNK_UNK So we need to get min mass and max FOS flywheelbut we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
UNK_UNK Same. 40 is the way to go
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK i'm determining c and dc
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK Whats your current diameter?
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK Do you know how C affects your FoS
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK it went down
UNK_UNK Looks like our FOS went up
UNK_UNK Who's in control of bore diameter?
UNK_UNK weight let me update my design
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK Okay we are at
UNK_UNK I'm getting poor right now
UNK_UNK something changed we were closer
UNK_UNK Does youyr part depend on my values?
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK Yeah, that was weird haha
UNK_UNK okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
UNK_UNK ya
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK and piston  diameter will affect my performance quality
UNK_UNK d_c
UNK_UNK What's the updated mass for the crankshaft?
UNK_UNK My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
UNK_UNK thinking about changing it to 55
UNK_UNK X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK what is your FOS now?
UNK_UNK I've changed to the lowest mass acceptable for fs > 2 for the piston
UNK_UNK do you depend on t1 or r1?
UNK_UNK What are those three?
UNK_UNK Oh yeah
UNK_UNK I say we stop changing
UNK_UNK that's big
UNK_UNK at 62.5 the mass goes up from 1.89 to 2.94
UNK_UNK Okay, thank you
UNK_UNK I don't actually
UNK_UNK ok ill leave then
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
UNK_UNK currently 1.64
UNK_UNK wow ok
UNK_UNK ds-60
UNK_UNK I need to know your crankshaft bearing offset value so tell me if you find anything good
UNK_UNK its already over 2
UNK_UNK yeah min is 2.77
UNK_UNK i did it
UNK_UNK Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
UNK_UNK and mass?
UNK_UNK Also, does me increasing c help you at all?
UNK_UNK Yeah, what's your system mass atm?
UNK_UNK So, is it good for you to be minimized?
UNK_UNK Do you want a lagre mass?
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK flywheel - update the group when you change!
UNK_UNK How much does our weight go up if you increase D?
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK sorry 50 mm
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK what is your fos now?
UNK_UNK agreed but isnt the factor of safety shown above that of the part with the lowest fos?
UNK_UNK So far as I can tell, I just need to make sure that this number is smaller than your flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK I would double my system weight though.
UNK_UNK right now we need to focus on mass
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK enough money for me
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK but you can't change that right?
UNK_UNK No, I do not need anything
UNK_UNK im just telling you you need to start hustlin
UNK_UNK It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I'm doing something wrong
UNK_UNK do you need any of my variables?
UNK_UNK Crankshaft asked for bore diameter. Thats all
UNK_UNK Can you do D =85?
UNK_UNK at excellent so dont change anything
UNK_UNK yay
UNK_UNK I'm good, thanks
UNK_UNK Wait, did you just change a value?
UNK_UNK I could try
UNK_UNK What value of the piston diameter should I use?
UNK_UNK Did your values just change?
UNK_UNK Lowering the diameter increases my FoS by about 4 and increases mass by about 1kg
UNK_UNK okay, I will see what i can do with 53
UNK_UNK Sorry, mass 25.69, fos 1.45
UNK_UNK f_os = 9193.31
UNK_UNK cuz mine depends on that
UNK_UNK Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass
UNK_UNK Hello.  Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
UNK_UNK it can range from 2 to 60
UNK_UNK No one is updating broadcast
UNK_UNK what's your current value?
UNK_UNK *he or she
UNK_UNK mine is 1200
UNK_UNK No i don't think so
UNK_UNK see what the other group members say
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK i think this is a trap
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK i see mine hadnt updated yet
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK do you think lower diameter will give you a higher fos?
UNK_UNK they don't wanna give us 20 bucks
UNK_UNK why isnt this exxcellent
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK X _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK Its now at 82.5
UNK_UNK What's your flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK ooo nice
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK nvm
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK try increasing your fos without increasing mass too much
UNK_UNK Is there any information I could give you that could help your design?
UNK_UNK 0.11
UNK_UNK 18.63
UNK_UNK I have two I can jump behind but it depends on what everyone else can get m and fos to
UNK_UNK and we need all the help we can get with fs
UNK_UNK time is up it says on my system
UNK_UNK i only depend on the piston
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is.  we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK crankshaft has a mass of 28
UNK_UNK what is the category?
UNK_UNK the one guy did not respond to my message
UNK_UNK same here
UNK_UNK I'm broadcasting my lowest I got
UNK_UNK yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good
UNK_UNK I think we should be good, just don't change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
UNK_UNK ok that was what I was seeing as well
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I assume the 30 was for the thickness right?
UNK_UNK we're at good
UNK_UNK Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
UNK_UNK Yeah that's what im trying to find out
UNK_UNK how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK and then I depend on ds, t_f, and D
UNK_UNK could you lower the mass by 2 kg without skrewing the fos
UNK_UNK you could try increasing D a little and see what happens overall
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK flywheel no word at all
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK check with the others
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass
UNK_UNK is the FOS of the design the lowest FOS of any one subsystem?
UNK_UNK I can try
UNK_UNK what are your ds and tf?
UNK_UNK lets decrease mass
UNK_UNK no i do not. i am compiling everyones
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK ok how much can you decrease mass before below 2?
UNK_UNK okay so lower D is better?
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.71
UNK_UNK My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK Wait, 13000 for FoS?
UNK_UNK my mass is 0.52
UNK_UNK or is it each case by case for each part ?
UNK_UNK I think c needs to be changed
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK so hows life
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor
UNK_UNK damn, same here 
UNK_UNK tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
UNK_UNK sweet thanks - let me know when you do
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK and Thickness of the flywheel
UNK_UNK I think the flywheel keeps changing values. I cant get a response tho
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
UNK_UNK so really not much
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK its good now just mass to worry about
UNK_UNK Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
UNK_UNK bottom
UNK_UNK minimize the weight of crankshaft and increase fos
UNK_UNK diameter is 25
UNK_UNK Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK I just updated it to that. I'll let the other people know
UNK_UNK Supposedly increasing the offset increases m and decreases f, so lose-lose for me
UNK_UNK Makes sense, but when I improve mine the overall systems decreases.
UNK_UNK nor crankshaft
UNK_UNK How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK What are your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK i waaaaaant mooooney
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn't have to blindly flail about, not knowing who has been told what yet
UNK_UNK X X O ; O O X ; X O O
UNK_UNK Right now I have D=85
UNK_UNK what's your FOS?
UNK_UNK whats the d and t values you
UNK_UNK it's corrected now
UNK_UNK Wasn't me
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK Can you change ds to 55 and braodcast
UNK_UNK I put mine to initial values and the FOS is good now
UNK_UNK For better or worse. want me to change mine and see how it affects yours real quick
UNK_UNK Yeah I think that's the best we can get
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK hmm okay
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK Can you decrease c to 60 and see what you get?
UNK_UNK GROUP: keep communicating!
UNK_UNK idk they haven't been super responsive
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK okay, what mass are you at!
UNK_UNK Your FOS is huge
UNK_UNK my design is basically fixed, i found a good design that have decent fos but not too heavy
UNK_UNK thank you!
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK need: piston bore diamter
UNK_UNK what fos are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK Are we good to end?
UNK_UNK the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK D = 75, r2=0.89, r3=0.8
UNK_UNK that doesn't make sense, you said your mass was 3.46?
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK sorry 60
UNK_UNK I think flywheel is where our problems are
UNK_UNK go back to what we were at
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK how did the mass go up
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK now 1.46
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK I think it's dependent on the flywheel, crankshaft, and connecting rod values at this point
UNK_UNK I haven't broadcasted yet ho
UNK_UNK Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there?
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize fos
UNK_UNK oh wait no
UNK_UNK ranges
UNK_UNK do you think I should try and increase those?
UNK_UNK Will do.
UNK_UNK Did you make any change after it was at very good?
UNK_UNK try to find a combo that gets you just above 2 fos but the lowest mass
UNK_UNK minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize fos
UNK_UNK frick my mass is 57
UNK_UNK yeah, working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass
UNK_UNK so why is our tital so low?
UNK_UNK ya, and im at poor quality, are you as well?
UNK_UNK We need to have the heavy parts drop mass
UNK_UNK can youget it lower?
UNK_UNK i was kidding about 3d
UNK_UNK 2.42
UNK_UNK just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK Broadcast the latest values
UNK_UNK sounds good ill do 45
UNK_UNK kk ill test
UNK_UNK and fos
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera?
UNK_UNK yuh
UNK_UNK no ive checked
UNK_UNK Oh I've got a different system FOS, mine is about 2
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK hey, Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be 10 mm, is this what you got?
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK What is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK excellent
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK X|X|O
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
UNK_UNK once you figure it out
UNK_UNK Whichever works best for you
UNK_UNK im using a 40
UNK_UNK also, can you give me tf (flywheel thickness)?
UNK_UNK basically all i can do is increase mass of the connecting and therefore increase facotr of safety
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK great!!
UNK_UNK I think we are good if we get excellent maybe?
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
UNK_UNK It just updated to 3.2, but yea. Is there any parameter you need from me?
UNK_UNK how do I broadcast?
UNK_UNK Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK That makes no sense
UNK_UNK when i try to bump FS up it moves us from very good to good so im  leaving it
UNK_UNK No. My values have been the same since about 9:45.
UNK_UNK w
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK I haven't changed my dimensions for awhile now, hope that helps
UNK_UNK oops, wrong value, my bad
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK so i dont think that i can change that much
UNK_UNK What piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK okay can di
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your FOS
UNK_UNK 105
UNK_UNK My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK I tihnk its the same thing
UNK_UNK Can you change that to 85?  or close to it?  That's what I have
UNK_UNK holy cow someone is making major changes
UNK_UNK and*
UNK_UNK yo bro
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK what option are you currently on
UNK_UNK Makes sense, the connecting rod probably has more impact on FOS than mass
UNK_UNK We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
UNK_UNK I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
UNK_UNK my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
UNK_UNK and FOS?
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK on my screen it says your limit is between 150 and 300?
UNK_UNK what ranges of mass do you have for your part?
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK If the piston diameter is 75, I can get a good mix of mass and fs
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
UNK_UNK I have not changed mine
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK what values are you using for the flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel
UNK_UNK no idea, our mass is way too high and FOS too low
UNK_UNK Are you in charge of choosing the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK with what I have now my mass is the lowest it can be
UNK_UNK Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
UNK_UNK its conrod
UNK_UNK 61.91
UNK_UNK I meant shaft diameter
UNK_UNK How's the design going? I think we got to an excellent rating already!
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK ok so id say you worry more about low mass with D and I can worry more about high FOS with ds
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK so youre at the value that is closest to 2 fos/
UNK_UNK Yea, it's better to minimize c
UNK_UNK did I?
UNK_UNK But I haven't changed anything and it went down.
UNK_UNK What's your mass?
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
UNK_UNK does yours show exccelent?
UNK_UNK any good values for the piston bore D?
UNK_UNK What variables do you control?
UNK_UNK if you increase the diameter
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK Kind of, increasing thickness increases FOS
UNK_UNK i  have fos at 3.23
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by .15 while also increasing fos by .65
UNK_UNK The diameter is now at 40.
UNK_UNK but we can try to imporve
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK I changed something but it didn't affect my mass at all
UNK_UNK r2 and r3 of the piston pin
UNK_UNK also broadcast those, I am not using your variables others might
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK For the flywheel shaft diameter i have 10
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight?
UNK_UNK c
UNK_UNK Cause the FOS only goes up by like .5
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK i have a fos of 2.47
UNK_UNK great minds think alike
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better to use greater value because 40mm is the minimum value
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest.  Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK Tell me the tradeoffs
UNK_UNK I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK same i have a minimized mass currently and stall a 3 fos
UNK_UNK 2.08
UNK_UNK someone is messing this up, are values are getting very bad
UNK_UNK aight
UNK_UNK Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
UNK_UNK Nevermind we getting there!
UNK_UNK Nope, havent changed anything
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK do you know if you can reduce mass?
UNK_UNK m=0.07 FOS=1.23
UNK_UNK Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness, piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK i dont know where to reduce the weight tho
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK bore diameter
UNK_UNK interesting
UNK_UNK Currently have a simulation at c=150, dc=50 ds=40 tf=51 D=105 with projected output ms=23.24 and fos=3.96
UNK_UNK good point
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK It's the same tradeoff for everyone
UNK_UNK wait can you explain again
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Ok looks like we're good
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK I see that c should be 60 is that what you have?
UNK_UNK I cant
UNK_UNK Cus thats our weak point rn
UNK_UNK is your fos 0.44?
UNK_UNK Since the lowest of my designs is like 140, I'm going to prioritize mass reduction
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK 1.14
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK Whichever gets you the highest
UNK_UNK my second option is m = 20.55 and fos = 2.83
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel
UNK_UNK my variables depend on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK What factors are you interested in?
UNK_UNK arent lining up
UNK_UNK so even with 2.01 FOS we can get excellent
UNK_UNK fos is bad
UNK_UNK What did u choose for D?
UNK_UNK What are your values
UNK_UNK oh wait, it might be the connecting rod
UNK_UNK how does dc affect mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK how can you maximize fos and we can work around that maybe?
UNK_UNK I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter, do those affect yours?
UNK_UNK Do you have direct control over piston diameter (D)?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK my masss is 6.28
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK I need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Does increasing c increase the mass or decrease
UNK_UNK can try small changes
UNK_UNK okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK Not by much. I can find values that work for it quickly
UNK_UNK thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK there is a default one but i'm trying to figure out how to change it
UNK_UNK or it
UNK_UNK how will those affect your value
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK Yeah, I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me.
UNK_UNK left side when walking in
UNK_UNK 2.77 for a diameter of 40
UNK_UNK nothing much i could change at 45
UNK_UNK what are you currently using for D?
UNK_UNK I haven't changed in 5 mins
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it
UNK_UNK did you change anything?
UNK_UNK mass = 1.19
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK it is at 150
UNK_UNK 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
UNK_UNK I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
UNK_UNK ok i will lessen the thickness!
UNK_UNK I decreases mass bu 0.04 and decreased FOS by 2 due to piston changes
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK you can change it and change it back if it gets worse
UNK_UNK ours just does donuts as of rn
UNK_UNK awesome job
UNK_UNK Okay no longer good on FOS
UNK_UNK kg
UNK_UNK our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me, can you try and get them to talk to me :( I need to discuss values with them
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK oh wow haha okay
UNK_UNK Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
UNK_UNK mine are piston diameter and head thickness
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK Okay I'm using my results for 80
UNK_UNK I'm still seeing 'poor' on my end
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK okay sounds good
UNK_UNK If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with FS less then 2
UNK_UNK im not sure if everyone is on board.
UNK_UNK keep other component variables constant?
UNK_UNK Ok, someone changed something and made it much worse
UNK_UNK what happended to our FOS?
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK wait someone changed something and it went way down
UNK_UNK At 75 diameter for me, the best I have is 2.85FOS and 6.26mass
UNK_UNK you?
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK I'm pretty sure no one depends on my variables though
UNK_UNK good idea
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK yeah that makes sense
UNK_UNK did you change anything
UNK_UNK we are at very good
UNK_UNK 2.36
UNK_UNK someone changed it again
UNK_UNK also i changed the diameter to 45
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK It wasn't me or the piston. Ive recorded my values in case something happens
UNK_UNK If we could lower the offset, that would optimize my fos
UNK_UNK diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK connecting rod thickness (t1) and connecting rod length ratio (r1)
UNK_UNK What piston diameter are you using that works well?
UNK_UNK flywheel changed a value and i lost 5 lbs!
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK What's going on, bud?
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK whats your mass
UNK_UNK I dont use ds I think
UNK_UNK okay sounds goof
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, conrod has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK 75
UNK_UNK can you share your variable letters (what you control and what you need)
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK What is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK now its 4.92
UNK_UNK also you can only see a few of the design variables, so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn't as good
UNK_UNK Wanna call it?
UNK_UNK What is your range for diameter?
UNK_UNK is your fs still 2.1?
UNK_UNK Is there anything I can do to help you?
UNK_UNK I'm not entirely sure. No matter what inputs I have, my mass and fos aren't changing and it;s a bit confusing
UNK_UNK with a ratio of 4
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK Also, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK i got barely any points on the third problem
UNK_UNK yeah i have the same questionb
UNK_UNK if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK what is your bore diameter?
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK 47.5
UNK_UNK Don't think so
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible
UNK_UNK but I think we're struggling with FOS now
UNK_UNK m = 0.07 and fos = 1.59
UNK_UNK how about increasing fos?
UNK_UNK i need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Flywheel is thinking we need to reduce mass
UNK_UNK What Bore diameter are you thinking about using?
UNK_UNK interstingly pisto-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK Are you still running with diameter of 40
UNK_UNK but imma find em
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK Ok I think someone is confused
UNK_UNK like i kinda dgaf about 375 anymore
UNK_UNK If you can make the bore Diameter 40 then I can get an Fos of 3.44
UNK_UNK Try and decrease C so that we increase the factor of safety
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK Do you depend on any of my variables?
UNK_UNK Is 40 the best value you have found for D
UNK_UNK Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
UNK_UNK Can you lower your diameter a touch? My options depend only on that.
UNK_UNK Okay, how about you try to increase your FS, prioritize that
UNK_UNK Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better FOS
UNK_UNK we are at excellent again
UNK_UNK diameter D has been at 40 whole time
UNK_UNK is this scooter
UNK_UNK Sweet, by how much?
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK mine is still at excellent so I don't know
UNK_UNK i dont htink piston did either
UNK_UNK Yes, that is when I used piston bore diameter of 105
UNK_UNK I'll check in with you on that in a sec
UNK_UNK what is the offset you have decided to use for the crannkshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK what do you need to increase it?
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos?
UNK_UNK piston diameter is 75, thickness is 10.5
UNK_UNK I tried decreasing my mass
UNK_UNK mass
UNK_UNK Currently the size is 40
UNK_UNK nope! do you need info from me?
UNK_UNK Hey, I am going to need the flywheel shaft diameter and the thickness of the flywheel. Do you have any possible numbers
UNK_UNK ya the fos is so bad
UNK_UNK I control the r values which will change the mass and the fos
UNK_UNK did it affect the overall?
UNK_UNK Just broadcasted it. I set D at 55
UNK_UNK I can reduce the mass of the piston, but, it's going to cost a bit on FOS. Drops FOS by 1 ish
UNK_UNK my lowest FOS is over 4000, crankshaft is the only person I would have to talk to\
UNK_UNK (i think)
UNK_UNK I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK for your ouputs only?
UNK_UNK Who changed?
UNK_UNK it just said very good
UNK_UNK The mass increased a lot
UNK_UNK ok conrod's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK I'm talking to fly wheel about it
UNK_UNK 75-105
UNK_UNK Would increasing or decreasing ds lower the weight?
UNK_UNK Mass yes
UNK_UNK Someone just changed something
UNK_UNK Diameter is 40 mm
UNK_UNK yes, the minimum is 700 haha
UNK_UNK piston pin has theirs at 1.23 and says that's their highest option
UNK_UNK its piston pin designer
UNK_UNK what is you flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK I adjusted my numbers, mass is now 0.16 fos is 4.66
UNK_UNK do you have a diameter that you feel comfortable working with?
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK im at 2.07
UNK_UNK Hell to the yeah
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK wont let me
UNK_UNK i meant for your part
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK Let me know if you change the bearing offset
UNK_UNK and FOS?
UNK_UNK Lets not change it now
UNK_UNK I think you need to change your c value
UNK_UNK Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
UNK_UNK what is your pin diameter?
UNK_UNK what is the mass of your system?
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK Is either tf or ds a variable of other subsystems for you?
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK doing that now
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK 12 kg? damn
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK no mine is 2.0
UNK_UNK #ERROR!
UNK_UNK now*
UNK_UNK if u want to adjust urs, u can announce to all chats
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK We've got a "Good" engine
UNK_UNK How about you?
UNK_UNK can you increase it to around 2 or 3
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
UNK_UNK oh true
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK I'm at 1.01 for mass if fos = 2.03. I don't think that can get better unless a shared dimension changes
UNK_UNK Currently I think the mass is too much.
UNK_UNK try flyweel thickness as 12.0 and shaft diameter as 60.0
UNK_UNK try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our fos significantly
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
UNK_UNK I just got my FOS up to 9
UNK_UNK whats your FOS if you drop mass by 3kg
UNK_UNK I believe FOS of 2.31
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK Is anybody out there?
UNK_UNK i don't believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK My piston mass is 0.52 and FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK what can we do in terms of slimming down mass
UNK_UNK can you please share your variables with just the letters
UNK_UNK Need to increase FOS
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that 
UNK_UNK Piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK c=60, dc=15
UNK_UNK sweet we just need to get mass down
UNK_UNK mass = 4, FoS = 2.4
UNK_UNK just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
UNK_UNK space
UNK_UNK Same haha
UNK_UNK how much weigh tcan you trim generally?
UNK_UNK can you try to reduce tf at all
UNK_UNK idk whos changing stuff
UNK_UNK so thats nice
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK it drops the FOS
UNK_UNK Alright. Do you have a value for the flywheel diameter?
UNK_UNK ok let me see how that effects my design
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK Hi, looks like we should increase the factor of safety. What factor of safety do you have for the piston
UNK_UNK flywheel says they have an FOS of 3286 apparently?
UNK_UNK 45=1.7, 48=1.15
UNK_UNK at this point, just piston diameter
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK i think everyone else has more influence than i do.  my max fos i can go to is 1.23 at the moment and my max mass is0.07
UNK_UNK i think so
UNK_UNK I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
UNK_UNK i just rebroadcasted
UNK_UNK sorry left my caps on
UNK_UNK 30 at the moment, but haven't run many yet
UNK_UNK we are doing well right now
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK diameter and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK try bore diamter of 40
UNK_UNK yeah increasing D changes mass by an enormous amount, like change of five adds 5 to ms
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK If I hold my variables same, the lower the diameter, the lower the Ms and fos
UNK_UNK 1.25?
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK both, becaus FOS is pretty low too
UNK_UNK I can increase my mass toi 0.75 and my Fos to 24.38
UNK_UNK Do you need any dimensions from me?
UNK_UNK and your mass?
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK (D) piston bore
UNK_UNK and our mass so high
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK 15886.04
UNK_UNK I'm at lowest mass for 55 bore diameter. I can step down to 47.5 bore diameter and that might help
UNK_UNK I can sacrifice some fos if it will take off a lot of mass
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK Check for broadcast now
UNK_UNK my part doesnt effect mass very much
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Bore diameter according to the piston is 40 mm
UNK_UNK Yeah, FOS hasn't been an issue for me, it's just mass is way too high
UNK_UNK D is min at 40 I think
UNK_UNK Let me know what flywheel thicknesses and flywheel shaft diamters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
UNK_UNK what numbers are u running
UNK_UNK but mine is flywheel, wont get any lower
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK I dont believe so
UNK_UNK okay I'll keep lowering it
UNK_UNK using r2= .5 r3=.2
UNK_UNK Fos decrease like 2-3
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK What mass are you at?
UNK_UNK Yeah, my fos is minimized as well
UNK_UNK damn
UNK_UNK My best values on both charts have c=60 in common
UNK_UNK I have it low as possible
UNK_UNK what is your bore diameter now?
UNK_UNK i'm asking around rn
UNK_UNK does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you?
UNK_UNK increase it to 50
UNK_UNK Hi! I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK ok same
UNK_UNK Alright, I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design, so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK Piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK 4000
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK We need FS to increase now
UNK_UNK I still see 40
UNK_UNK Still 40mm. Will increasing bore help your design?
UNK_UNK Currently the Piston Bore Diameter is 40
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK ya, try 75
UNK_UNK currently working with them
UNK_UNK Whats your mass and Fos?
UNK_UNK Do you know who controls those factors?
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK lets take bets on who goes rogue
UNK_UNK was that you?
UNK_UNK ok what about mass?
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK the one i'm at now is the best one there is on the list
UNK_UNK just as a reference
UNK_UNK thanks! :)
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK What inputs do you need for calculating the diameter, if any?
UNK_UNK piston-pin is not responding
UNK_UNK okay i just put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
UNK_UNK mm
UNK_UNK What is our piston Bore?
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK but stil m=3.48
UNK_UNK The greater the values for either of those, the greater the FOS and mass
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK 1.35 i mean
UNK_UNK We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
UNK_UNK now it's back ?? idk
UNK_UNK Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
UNK_UNK for mass?
UNK_UNK can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
UNK_UNK Brendan
UNK_UNK unless it drastically changes the mass
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK me neither, poor now
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK The global variables are giving our current FOS is 0.57 so I think we need to maximize that
UNK_UNK _|_|_
UNK_UNK Try 15
UNK_UNK if we can do that it cuts my mass to 1.24
UNK_UNK So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK you next?
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK alright, I can get 2.77 with that value for D, Do you plan on changing D?
UNK_UNK I agree. My part increases in weight linearly and increases in FOS exponentially so its probably better to maximize it. Do you have a part that increases in FOS only linearly? you can see it on the graphs
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK how do they affect the mass and safety factor
UNK_UNK I'm happy with my numbers, but if you need to change something I will compensate
UNK_UNK See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
UNK_UNK For the current bore diameter, yes. If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results
UNK_UNK dwhat is your current piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Yeah I'm talking to the crankshaft
UNK_UNK They just told me their FOS is very high
UNK_UNK I will ask others
UNK_UNK fos went up
UNK_UNK for my component
UNK_UNK same 60 is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now
UNK_UNK what's your fos
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK let me reduce the D to 40
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK we are pretty close
UNK_UNK Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK tf increases mass...
UNK_UNK we are in excellent rn
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK Perfect
UNK_UNK yall stay at where you are
UNK_UNK or we were for a second
UNK_UNK 2.83
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK flywheel would...
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK at the top it says round 2
UNK_UNK Wanna call it?
UNK_UNK So is there any tradeoff at all?
UNK_UNK yea it was perfect a minute ago
UNK_UNK ill go with a ratio of 4 so 900 for connector length
UNK_UNK yeah, told him to reduce it to save some weight
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK End experiment, nice worK!
UNK_UNK If you make it bigger, mass goes up and fos as well?
UNK_UNK how do i checkt that
UNK_UNK My design includes r2 and r3, do those affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK i did
UNK_UNK As long as your fos is above 2, try to find the lowest possible mass
UNK_UNK try to get the mass down below 40
UNK_UNK I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
UNK_UNK Our mass keeps going up
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK What is your range of fos?
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK try to decrease you mass while keeping a FOS above 2
UNK_UNK Literally, there is not
UNK_UNK Is 70 the best value for bore design or have you not messed with it yet?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
UNK_UNK diameter is 80
UNK_UNK I think its cause when anyone else changes their numberss it effects the other numbers
UNK_UNK know whats our next challenge
UNK_UNK were at fair now
UNK_UNK but im stillsuspicious
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK gotcha, try 85 then
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK ...
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK If you reduce FOS to around 2, can we reduce weight?
UNK_UNK What is the factor of safety of the connecting rod at the moment?
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK *max
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK the flywheel apparently only has a mass of 1.27
UNK_UNK Who depends on your variables?
UNK_UNK Do you have piston bore diameter?(D)
UNK_UNK Mass increases, but only by about 1kg at most and FoS increases by about 4
UNK_UNK I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
UNK_UNK I remember the parameter I had
UNK_UNK 6.72
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK dc is crank-pin diameter
UNK_UNK No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
UNK_UNK wait i wonder if the third guy is against the wall too
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK no one depends on mine either
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK yep i got it
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
UNK_UNK are you making any changes  ?
UNK_UNK im at what ive always been at
UNK_UNK yeah agreed, it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect, so im going to stick to maximizing FOS
UNK_UNK now it says 2.03
UNK_UNK Hahaha wow
UNK_UNK So we are in good range right now
UNK_UNK Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
UNK_UNK GROUP: keep communicating!
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK is your FOS 1.79?
UNK_UNK it's just good
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK is flywheel talking>
UNK_UNK Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
UNK_UNK its as small as itll go
UNK_UNK im trying 90 mm
UNK_UNK ok who will my t_h or piston head thickness affect?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find out what everyone's FS is. crankshafter has theirs at 3.62
UNK_UNK Just D
UNK_UNK and the Flywheel shaft diameter to be 15
UNK_UNK so keep playing with your parameters and ill let you know how it impacts me
UNK_UNK do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK Oh yeah okay.
UNK_UNK ok the lower you have it the higher my Fos
UNK_UNK I think someone's trying to get excellent
UNK_UNK thickness = 8
UNK_UNK my friend offered to help tho so we may be able to fix ours
UNK_UNK what are the other variables you need?
UNK_UNK have you considered using 75?
UNK_UNK I didnt change anything
UNK_UNK is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
UNK_UNK cant decrease it anymore, its at 40
UNK_UNK so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high FOS
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
UNK_UNK yea we're at excellent
UNK_UNK yes, they are active
UNK_UNK can you get that FOS up?
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK FS is good just decrease mass
UNK_UNK Have you broadcasted anything recently?
UNK_UNK we are at very good right now
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
UNK_UNK tell them that!
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK I mean Fs only needs to be greater than 2
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK i still have my two best broadcasted
UNK_UNK I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK Thats great, any way you can reduce weight more then?
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK If i increase diameter we go over weight. Still on lowest setting
UNK_UNK lower increases my mass and FOS
UNK_UNK Piston diameter
UNK_UNK the weight increased for some reason
UNK_UNK *mine
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK It still says .51 and he said that was for the team and that I couldn't see my own. I don't know if that makes sense though??
UNK_UNK is your fos 0.09 now?
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK honestly the best bet for me would be a fos of above two and make the smallest weight possible
UNK_UNK rn i have a 90 mm diameter
UNK_UNK my fos is max right now at 1.23 and m of 0.07
UNK_UNK I reduced the diameter to 40mm to reduce the mass of the system
UNK_UNK Got and idea for the flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK didnt change anything
UNK_UNK i guess it's good
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK also which FS are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK No I do flywheel diameter
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK 1.48, my mass is so small im just trying to increase my fos
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK "This crankshaft is so broke I can hear it asking me for money"
UNK_UNK what's your mass and fos when diameter of 70mm is used?
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK my part maintains FOS=2.06
UNK_UNK _|X|_
UNK_UNK try to decrease mass while keeping FOS over 2
UNK_UNK i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
UNK_UNK Sick, our engine is now excellent
UNK_UNK is that your ideal dim?
UNK_UNK did any mass values change?
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK whats the corresponding fos?
UNK_UNK $$$$$
UNK_UNK ya we can always change it too
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK are you the conrod designer
UNK_UNK ds is 20
UNK_UNK increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall
UNK_UNK We need to save weight
UNK_UNK K, what is your weight?
UNK_UNK looks like we're done?
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK Is the mass significantly increased?
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK th, D, m, fos
UNK_UNK I'm gonna switch down to 47.5 diameter for a sec and see what happens. I can increase FOS a bunch by doing that and only add a small bit of mass
UNK_UNK How is your design coming along, do you need any data from me?
UNK_UNK it's corrected
UNK_UNK I'm using 85 so my mass now is 6.72
UNK_UNK My bad that wasn't clear, I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high FOS to begin with
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK getting close
UNK_UNK mine only goes up to 30 max
UNK_UNK ya, seems like we have agreement on that
UNK_UNK Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
UNK_UNK Should we do 75 for D or not so low
UNK_UNK what is your mas and fos?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK Group: no more changes!
UNK_UNK group: who wants to go next?
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK try getting fos above 3 without increasing mass too much
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK what are your ranges?
UNK_UNK Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK what values do you have control over?
UNK_UNK I dunno
UNK_UNK report weight
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Yes please!
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
UNK_UNK mine is 29
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK could yo slightly lower your diamter again?
UNK_UNK i havent changed
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK .45-5
UNK_UNK what variable do you control?
UNK_UNK Nevermind
UNK_UNK okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
UNK_UNK mine: ms 1.07, fos 35.82
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK so close
UNK_UNK It showed very good and I haven't changed anything since then.
UNK_UNK or maybe two or three are tied
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
UNK_UNK Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
UNK_UNK t = 10
UNK_UNK what is the range for your mass values?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK did you get FOS as 1.81?
UNK_UNK new c is broadcast
UNK_UNK there
UNK_UNK ask
UNK_UNK currently with the rod designer
UNK_UNK what is the range of values you can choose?
UNK_UNK Do you know where our low Fos is coming from?
UNK_UNK do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
UNK_UNK mines at 3.84
UNK_UNK rip too late
UNK_UNK The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
UNK_UNK I can minimize my diameter
UNK_UNK Is there anything related to an increase/decrease in mass/fos on your end?
UNK_UNK flywheel, are you good?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK You're right!
UNK_UNK ok so if you increase C my fos goes down but weight is not effected
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK woo!
UNK_UNK getting close
UNK_UNK DONT CHANGE
UNK_UNK I think we should go with 40
UNK_UNK whats your fos at for current settings
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting that?
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK who many rounds do we getr?
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK Yeah they said they're not going to change it now
UNK_UNK Flywheel prob
UNK_UNK he won't respond to me
UNK_UNK what is your diameter?
UNK_UNK ok.
UNK_UNK d back to 10 now because fos is high
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK or global?
UNK_UNK I see
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK I haven't changed a thing
UNK_UNK the final isnt cumulative tho
UNK_UNK mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
UNK_UNK Did you change your broadcast by anychance?
UNK_UNK mine is currently 2.16 so I'll cut that a little closer
UNK_UNK Has yours updated yet?
UNK_UNK What can you change that increases your FOS?
UNK_UNK D = 90 for now
UNK_UNK What is your piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK we should aim for a smaller total mass, it's a little close to 40
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK and go max
UNK_UNK alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
UNK_UNK even in the case by case basis, the higher the FOS the better
UNK_UNK alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
UNK_UNK unless you change that at all?
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
UNK_UNK it was onlt for a sec
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK I know, but the weight is higher for my other options above 2
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK Do you need any parameters from me ?
UNK_UNK Piston Bore I am currently working with is 55mm
UNK_UNK No I'm using the crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK flyweel is good too
UNK_UNK no I got my best value
UNK_UNK what is your mass/fos
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK Flywheel isn't communicating thats the problem
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK does that work well for you?
UNK_UNK definitely try and get your FOS up!
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK try to increase your FS
UNK_UNK yeah it sucked
UNK_UNK okay sweet
UNK_UNK oh damn mine is 0~0.06 when i put diameter as 50
UNK_UNK Nope, mass = 1.27, fos_s=13238
UNK_UNK I'm good too
UNK_UNK those are my values
UNK_UNK it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK 75 mm is the bore diameter
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK lets just try getting our mass down
UNK_UNK oh I see
UNK_UNK That would be my guess too.
UNK_UNK it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
UNK_UNK Havent heard back from piston though
UNK_UNK We've got far too much mass at the moment overall
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK I'm going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it
UNK_UNK im trying to figure out who has the min FOS
UNK_UNK diameter is 25 mm
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK make sure it's broadcasting propperyly, I've had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all
UNK_UNK alright I will try and reduce the mass
UNK_UNK so all the values you get are assuming max piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK That's the minimum
UNK_UNK increasing it will increase the force on the connecting rod
UNK_UNK Do you know whose FOS is the lowest at the moment?
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK no i do not
UNK_UNK Do you still have your diameter at maximum?
UNK_UNK okay sweet
UNK_UNK 2
UNK_UNK Oh wait we hit excellent
UNK_UNK As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
UNK_UNK piston guy controls it
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
UNK_UNK By how much would be good for you?
UNK_UNK so for you design a lower c is better?  does dc affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK quality just went down to poor for me. seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything?
UNK_UNK I change it to 80 now
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK It looks a little better now
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK 1.92
UNK_UNK No, you?
UNK_UNK Have you chosen a crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK Mass: 1.75 FOS:6.07
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK try and use 60 for C
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK 2.06
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK _|O|O
UNK_UNK 1.3 and mass is too high
UNK_UNK ok that's good
UNK_UNK So we can keep it low
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK first day on the job or something?
UNK_UNK .06 and 2.62
UNK_UNK can you cut the mass by any chance?
UNK_UNK good stick with that
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department.  Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK I can hold mine above 2 and reduce but me having a high FOS might brign the overall up for not much more mass
UNK_UNK I do the control ds but its the same
UNK_UNK I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting new values?
UNK_UNK i did it.  Looks a little closer but not quite there
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that
UNK_UNK Our FOS went up
UNK_UNK niceee haha
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK agree
UNK_UNK if I increase the offset, mass increases
UNK_UNK itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
UNK_UNK Ok, just making sure, thanks
UNK_UNK q5: is it a windshield wiper
UNK_UNK do you know what's going on?
UNK_UNK do you need r2 or r3?
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
UNK_UNK Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK 70
UNK_UNK hey the flywheel guy needs some info from you
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
UNK_UNK who went down in weight?
UNK_UNK If you increase the piston bore diameter (D) it increases my FOS
UNK_UNK 0.53 is the mass of my piston currently
UNK_UNK fake
UNK_UNK yup just got that, asked piston to lower his mass. Just to see
UNK_UNK Or rather, what affects it
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK what is your mass/fos
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK don't put it at whatever it was at for when it read excellent
UNK_UNK i have 1.27
UNK_UNK no nothing affects me
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK Now Im at good. weights a bit high but FOS is right on
UNK_UNK great job
UNK_UNK okay thats nothing
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK they said they didnt change it
UNK_UNK I am updating my pin now to get a FOS of about 2.1 and reduce the mass
UNK_UNK No, i dont think so. I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter 
UNK_UNK increasing the bore diameter will increase the factor of safety as well as increase weight
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Okay, do you know who is making the FOS so low?
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK did you try playing around with bearing offset ?
UNK_UNK Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
UNK_UNK I think that is a good idea
UNK_UNK what are yous mass/fos
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK I have the piston set to near lowest mass (m=0.69 and fos = 3.84) sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK Am broadcasting 150 and 50
UNK_UNK did any mass values change?
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK so its fine
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK tf is 10
UNK_UNK Ok, I will try that now
UNK_UNK ratio for piston pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK i havent broadccasted anything new
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK Piston diameter of 75
UNK_UNK c = 85 dc = 15
UNK_UNK mass 1.24
UNK_UNK so nevermind haha
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK Yes, mass minimization is quite useless on my end, as my values are 0.02 - 0.12
UNK_UNK piston is0.91
UNK_UNK m = 0.12 with f at 3.44
UNK_UNK i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK Hello, What parameters do you need from me
UNK_UNK Fos = 1215
UNK_UNK on your list, 
UNK_UNK It doesn't as far as I know, but the length of the crankshaft does. What is your current value for r?
UNK_UNK Yea i believe so. what is it?
UNK_UNK object? i dont know the options for categories lol
UNK_UNK the only person changing values is the flywheel
UNK_UNK all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
UNK_UNK oh noooo go back
UNK_UNK alright, guess no then
UNK_UNK I'm not sure how this works tbh haha
UNK_UNK what c value do you currently have?
UNK_UNK What just changed?
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK think low fos is from piston pin
UNK_UNK and can it be lowered
UNK_UNK What about you
UNK_UNK mine also
UNK_UNK how does diameter affect your part?
UNK_UNK Im at 0.1 rn with a fos of 2.52
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK right now i have a thickness of 12 and diameter of 60
UNK_UNK pretty sure no one
UNK_UNK I do not
UNK_UNK Just did
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK i am at my lowest
UNK_UNK if one of the other values changes, does it give you more options? Like if D increased or decreased?
UNK_UNK i  depennd on C
UNK_UNK we reached good
UNK_UNK cool, if you can minimize mass with a higher FS, do that
UNK_UNK My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK but no one changed anything i believe
UNK_UNK DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK right :(
UNK_UNK ok got it
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK lets just try getting our mass down
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK ill try decreasing my mass slightly
UNK_UNK i didnt touvch anything
UNK_UNK wonderful system, this is.
UNK_UNK can you try 80?
UNK_UNK Maybe. not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up
UNK_UNK did u change D to 88?
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK no way
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK yeah it does now
UNK_UNK Now it is 80
UNK_UNK Yes, my most recent design is what is broadcasted
UNK_UNK D ds and tf
UNK_UNK I set t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4, and the quality turns out to be excellent
UNK_UNK What variables do you need to consider?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK i just clicked broadcast
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK Do you know if theres a specific way all our parts work together? I can change mass and FS of my part but depending on like my offset do other parts need to be a certain dimension?
UNK_UNK Let me know if changing my D value could help improve the FOS or mass
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK For D = 75 and D = 85, what are the minimum masses you can have for a FOS of 2?
UNK_UNK Where is the "change variables of other subsystems" button that it talks about in the handout?
UNK_UNK good job!
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK can you try increasing ds?
UNK_UNK who are you working with?
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK anything above a diamter of 47 gives me very low FOS
UNK_UNK what is your fos and mass?
UNK_UNK No, not that I know of
UNK_UNK Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK We just hit very good
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK I think he'll need my Diameter to increarse, but if i do that then piston-pin FOS goes below 1
UNK_UNK lower bore diameter? on it. I'll go down to 55 and see what we can get
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK Must be crankshaft
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values?
UNK_UNK I havn't changed it since the beginning
UNK_UNK i didnt change anything
UNK_UNK yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good ?
UNK_UNK so im going to max piston bore diamter  and well iterate from there
UNK_UNK Yea, but also the weight
UNK_UNK What bore diameter are you choosing?
UNK_UNK good working with ya
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK I dont no
UNK_UNK do*
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK min with highest fos
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK we are at excellent now
UNK_UNK Mine is at 2.36
UNK_UNK what's your fos ?
UNK_UNK 150 is the lower bound...
UNK_UNK we went from excellent to poor, rip
UNK_UNK does increasing D give you better or worse weight
UNK_UNK now VERY GOOd. we should sit here
UNK_UNK mines at 3
UNK_UNK yeah don't do that lol
UNK_UNK I'm thinking larger D makes my part heavier
UNK_UNK increase* sorry
UNK_UNK Only the lowest matters, so there's no need for anything above 2
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
UNK_UNK let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK Yeah the piston bore
UNK_UNK i was at t=10 and d=15 or 20
UNK_UNK piston-pin is not responding
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at good
UNK_UNK okay that seems good
UNK_UNK Ok. Our FOS isn't too bad right now so that's probably a good place to be at the moment
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my value
UNK_UNK And a thickness of 12?
UNK_UNK Let me know what piston bore diameters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
UNK_UNK thats with both at their minimum so it can't get any lower for my part
UNK_UNK c and dc
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK this is what i ahve rn
UNK_UNK What variables/equations do you deal with?
UNK_UNK what variable can you change  for "change variables of other sub-systems?"
UNK_UNK i am interested in the crankshaft bearing offset by another designer
UNK_UNK from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK but my mass is max 1.61 kg so its very small percent
UNK_UNK i see
UNK_UNK according to the thing on the screen it says very good
UNK_UNK O|X|X
UNK_UNK I've increased thickness to 5 mm
UNK_UNK at 47.5 or 55?
UNK_UNK did your mass just change a ton
UNK_UNK Hey whats the Fs for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK Do you need me to change anything?
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
UNK_UNK Keep me updated on your piston bore diameter. It's something I'll need in my simulations
UNK_UNK sorry I was distracted by other teammates\
UNK_UNK Okay. I played around with it at the beginning and I don't think my FOS has a huge affect on the overall FOS. My mass is only 3.17, and my FOS is at 2. That's where I thought I would keep it for now.
UNK_UNK Its probably weighted. If we can raise the lowest fos to its max and the highest fos to its min mass it might work
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK what is going on
UNK_UNK we still need to reduce mass by a lot
UNK_UNK Can you find a way to increase the FOS for your component?
UNK_UNK I can give a FOS=6 with m = 0.4
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK Will do
UNK_UNK However, I cannot do that because it's critical to the weight of piston
UNK_UNK duh
UNK_UNK Don't change it!
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK let me check
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK yes, piston bore is 80
UNK_UNK do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters?
UNK_UNK mine is 2.44
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK It is updated. That's my current broadcast.
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK 0.63 mass
UNK_UNK 2.79
UNK_UNK Thanks!
UNK_UNK i hope they read all this
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK t1 and r1
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK I'm working with Piston to improve my FOS
UNK_UNK 200 for offset works better for me
UNK_UNK Did you make any change after it was at very good?
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77 now, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK wait what
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK can you try the one thats closes to 2?
UNK_UNK thats the pistonpin i think. rn i have piston diameter of 90
UNK_UNK Did you just change something?
UNK_UNK switched to 43
UNK_UNK Okay, I think I have control of L and r.
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK nvmd
UNK_UNK Global requirements top of page
UNK_UNK and we are just trying to optimize somehow?
UNK_UNK Mass is 0.1 right?
UNK_UNK oh the round number is the simulation number
UNK_UNK retweet
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK increase in either variable causes both the mass and FOS to go up
UNK_UNK I Havent updated in awhile so my numbers are ms: 3.64 Fs:6.92
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK check for a broadcast maybe?
UNK_UNK If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our FOS
UNK_UNK So I'm trying to pick values of D and tH that will minimize m and maximize FOS, but I know D also interacts with Force
UNK_UNK probably
UNK_UNK time is up i believe
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK What is your current mass at?
UNK_UNK my mass is pretty low already. But make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK haha yea fingers crossed it stays at very good
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK Our mass just increased a lot
UNK_UNK new phone who dis?
UNK_UNK my graphs don't show up so i'm somewhat limited
UNK_UNK one sec
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK im going to try to change it to get FOS higher and yeah I broadcasted
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK your part
UNK_UNK I am thanks for letting me know!
UNK_UNK have you lowered mass as much as you can?
UNK_UNK 3
UNK_UNK >:(((((((((((
UNK_UNK I'm testing to see how a crankshaft offset affects my fos and mass, first
UNK_UNK What did you choose your diameter to be?
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK Are you still at 160 for support offset?
UNK_UNK didnt touch anything
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Ye i think so, mine for just my part is 3.84
UNK_UNK the new design looks real good
UNK_UNK the mass shot up
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK Im gonna do 150 instead
UNK_UNK hmm that's weird
UNK_UNK 5.75 @ 75
UNK_UNK it's poor again lol
UNK_UNK mass = 9.86
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK lil nas????
UNK_UNK I have not been having a lot of luck, try something like 110mm
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK yes can do
UNK_UNK tf just changes the mass for me
UNK_UNK 15 to 25
UNK_UNK we just need our Fos to be more than 2 ?
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK broadcast that
UNK_UNK Ok I think you are solid then
UNK_UNK Is your FOS twelve hundred??!
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK Thats great
UNK_UNK increases FOS and mass
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK lets try that
UNK_UNK update back to very good
UNK_UNK 4.42 and 10.19
UNK_UNK What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK mass as low as possible
UNK_UNK whats the range of mass you have?
UNK_UNK mass is 1.7 and fos is 3.5
UNK_UNK where u at
UNK_UNK Are these affecting your results?
UNK_UNK The crankshaft has FOS = 3.05 and mass = 1.33 and that's about the lowest mass I can get with FOS > 2
UNK_UNK What variables do you need to consider?
UNK_UNK I get better values when it is smaller
UNK_UNK by the way, I can get an fs of 10.19 if you go down to 75
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK any preference on the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK can you please share your design variables so that we know what each needs
UNK_UNK We once had an excellent quality though
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK wait which two is it? the two directly behind us? or the one sitting like further right?
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK the values range as other engineers alter their broadcasted values
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK Maybe ask around
UNK_UNK The crankshaft designed is changing values
UNK_UNK i broadcasted my best
UNK_UNK can you reduce fos a bit and reduce the weight?
UNK_UNK from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK and broadcast the design
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK yes but i didnt broadcast
UNK_UNK still mass = 9.86 and fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK wow english
UNK_UNK 130
UNK_UNK and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK As of right now, I'm comfortable around 85 for my diameter, but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass
UNK_UNK whats your mass at?
UNK_UNK and t_h is 2
UNK_UNK Someone changed something
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK So I think lower D is better
UNK_UNK The fos range for others is between 2.5 and 4.09
UNK_UNK and then my system depends on 3 other variables
UNK_UNK its actually at the minimum
UNK_UNK what is your current value for flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK Im sticking with that
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK our mass seems to be going up, are you using the original values?
UNK_UNK sweet, ill update my FOS
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK and see what happens
UNK_UNK so that seems too big
UNK_UNK my lowest fos is still 700. mass only goes down to .52 and its there
UNK_UNK Ok, then I think minimizing offset it fine
UNK_UNK No i changed th piston head thickness but not the diameter
UNK_UNK like one part has huge FS so they just minimized mass bc the part has FS over 100 no matter what option they choose
UNK_UNK Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system?
UNK_UNK do you need to work with C?
UNK_UNK ive been at the first broadcast for a while now
UNK_UNK Are you still going with a crankshaft of 80?
UNK_UNK *conrod
UNK_UNK what mass are you using?
UNK_UNK i know
UNK_UNK are all the values you get assuming you maximize the variables out of your control?
UNK_UNK barely communicating
UNK_UNK 1.15
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK oh yeah but this communication system is a struggle
UNK_UNK I don't understand
UNK_UNK clarify flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness numbers
UNK_UNK hmm i reverted to previous dimensions
UNK_UNK tf = 12
UNK_UNK We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK your individual mass?
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK yeah :/
UNK_UNK you got it
UNK_UNK the mass went up
UNK_UNK Is there any way you can lower your weight?
UNK_UNK I can try, that is the limit tho
UNK_UNK Lower makes it worse
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK Oh, wow. My FoS is in the 20s, so I can definitely scale back
UNK_UNK my current fos is .67 and I think it should be above one
UNK_UNK I'm asking around
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK Awesome, thank you
UNK_UNK that was with r2 at .5, r3 at.7 and D at 40
UNK_UNK Is your FS really low?
UNK_UNK the alternetives are either increase weight by a bunch or decrease fos by a lot
UNK_UNK im at 0.22 and 2.02
UNK_UNK It's up
UNK_UNK Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot.
UNK_UNK Im sticking to a small mass bc right now we are heavier than allowed
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK require: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK no I am just refreshing
UNK_UNK Group: no more changes!
UNK_UNK rad
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK man what happened
UNK_UNK let me know if you do
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop more mass
UNK_UNK yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
UNK_UNK My FS went down I think.
UNK_UNK *same
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK how
UNK_UNK What's your mass?
UNK_UNK Ok I think ive worked out a good combo as far as mass/fos.
UNK_UNK what is your fos? can you reduce your mass at all while staying above fos=2.1
UNK_UNK I'm starting with 40
UNK_UNK i have diameter at 47.5with m = 0.07 and fos = 1.23
UNK_UNK yes i changed my numbers
UNK_UNK mass is to 4
UNK_UNK Im at 4.09
UNK_UNK thickness=2, ratio=3
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK awesome, i think this will help. Should I go to my lowest setting or no? Im on my second to lowest setting right now
UNK_UNK you mean the global variables? the FOS is 0.57 right now
UNK_UNK whats your fos at
UNK_UNK no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK wanna shoot for excellent? :P
UNK_UNK mine is 0.14 which is highest for my lowest mass option
UNK_UNK it's 5625 but my part has a weird fos
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK yeahh i realized that when she got up
UNK_UNK Right. Got mine to mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK just saw that
UNK_UNK Have you changed bore diameter at all?
UNK_UNK what is your mass currently?
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK the fos is quit low
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK flywheel FOS are all very high
UNK_UNK and mass?
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK I think L1 does affect me though
UNK_UNK Im working on the piston
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK mine is 1215
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK diameter is 90
UNK_UNK It's connecting rod Casey geez
UNK_UNK I have conrod thickness and the ratio between conrod length and crank length
UNK_UNK crankshaft is right next to me too lol
UNK_UNK this looks like some weird morse code
UNK_UNK What just changed?
UNK_UNK I have not decided on them yet.
UNK_UNK ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
UNK_UNK 1.29
UNK_UNK did u ever get ur 375 exam back
UNK_UNK what current mass and fos do you have?
UNK_UNK Who is the fly wheel designer ?
UNK_UNK i dont think so
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK Flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK same same
UNK_UNK whats your name fam?
UNK_UNK yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by .01 so probably not me
UNK_UNK I imagine these would contribute to more mass
UNK_UNK Group: no more changes!
UNK_UNK I'm gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
UNK_UNK Nope must be the other two that need that
UNK_UNK pass it on
UNK_UNK Oh I did not receive that update, I'll try my numbers at 40 
UNK_UNK 1.94
UNK_UNK what variables do you depend on?
UNK_UNK if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK my variables are t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4.
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK i got it from crankshaft
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK im at 0.06
UNK_UNK what parameters do you have?
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK i havent really started yet
UNK_UNK 2.5
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK ready?
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK good point
UNK_UNK are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness
UNK_UNK 3.05
UNK_UNK do your projected outputs change when an update happens?
UNK_UNK ok!
UNK_UNK D
UNK_UNK It just updated
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK yep i think so
UNK_UNK I raised mine to 2.28 so someone made a change to something much lower than that
UNK_UNK m 1.14 fos 1.32
UNK_UNK 1.27
UNK_UNK we already had it once
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK lol sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK I have not
UNK_UNK what's your mass ?
UNK_UNK we need mass to be less than 3
UNK_UNK yo uright
UNK_UNK yeah, I see the change now
UNK_UNK working on it
UNK_UNK Smaller diameter is better for me
UNK_UNK overall fos is decreawseing
UNK_UNK and yea I am broadcasting
UNK_UNK Yes but that will also reduce fos and I am the lowest at 1.45 rn
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK Make sure you dont drop too much mass though
UNK_UNK ok looks like you have the biggest % of mass in our system
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK they said they ddnt
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK yeah I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK yes!
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK any updates?
UNK_UNK I'm about to drop the fos and mass because rod designer said it might help them
UNK_UNK dont change anything hahah
UNK_UNK 2.03 for fos
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK What external variables affect your design?
UNK_UNK _|_|o
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK *your
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK do you control ds?
UNK_UNK i feel like we care about the lowest Fos of all subsystems
UNK_UNK Im using .8 and .55 for r2 and r3
UNK_UNK do ti
UNK_UNK I haven't touched anything
UNK_UNK i can decrase on the weight but the FOS wouldn't meet requirement
UNK_UNK m_s : 1.46;   fos_s : 1.32;
UNK_UNK now we are at very good
UNK_UNK do you depend on my variables?
UNK_UNK fos?
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK what about you?
UNK_UNK I can probably drop down by another 0.01 or 0.02 if necessary
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
UNK_UNK Do you have an estimate to what diameter you want for the piston bore?
UNK_UNK It increases the mass a lot
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK try making your fos high because i think that is really hurting the oveerall fos
UNK_UNK Just broadcasted it. I chose 55 for D
UNK_UNK is there any way you can make our fos increase
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK Not too bad, not excited for the lab
UNK_UNK what bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK _|X|_
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK whats your fos
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK noooooooooooo
UNK_UNK Okay, then you can do what you need to increase the FOS, then let me know the new D
UNK_UNK haha
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK also reducing c significantly reduces the FOS
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK I have the piston bore diameter set to 47.5 currently
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK Crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK What is your piston bore diameter right now
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
UNK_UNK Thats great, let's see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length
UNK_UNK do you need my thickness to increase?
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK like our robot is handicapped
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK **suspiciously looks around room**
UNK_UNK Yep
UNK_UNK WHO THE HELL KEEPS MOVING IT TO POOR
UNK_UNK Do you have a factor of safety above 2.06?
UNK_UNK *person's
UNK_UNK Nevermind, global changed to 55.36 and 2.03
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now, in terms of mass and fos
UNK_UNK do we just sit here now?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to while considering what piston did
UNK_UNK Ok do you have a set variable? In your chart
UNK_UNK How does the bearing support offset affect your part?
UNK_UNK Yeah I just saw that. and our weight is massive
UNK_UNK and fos 0f 15k
UNK_UNK piston is in charge of the diameter
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK no clue
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK that's better than poor
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK okay now we're better lol - idk what happened
UNK_UNK I still see the total mass of 2.84
UNK_UNK piston-pin?
UNK_UNK bets on who goes rogue
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK piston bore diameter affects both crankshaft and conrods' variables
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK yea
UNK_UNK Hi how is it going?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK yuppppp
UNK_UNK we havent added it yet
UNK_UNK there ya go
UNK_UNK and ya no its not which is nice
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
UNK_UNK Yeah thats because our parts are heavy
UNK_UNK ������\_(?)_/������
UNK_UNK But I can try that
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK Can your mass be reduced at all?
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK its bleow 40 and above 2
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK Mine neither
UNK_UNK I'm trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass
UNK_UNK but we have a good design
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK I can adjust thickness to have a required FOS at a specific D
UNK_UNK what about the fos?
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK The conrod asked me to change it to see how it affects the numbers. I think 82.5 will be the best
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK Diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK although the new broadcast increased the mass
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK q2: is is smaller than a refridgerator
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK whats the lightest you can go with fs > 2
UNK_UNK it seems so, yet we are still over the mass limit?
UNK_UNK FOS = 2, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
UNK_UNK piston says flywheel is lowest fos
UNK_UNK I don't have control over any diameters
UNK_UNK my part minimized the mass while keeping FOS>2, will keep updating it
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK For the one I just ran I got 2.62
UNK_UNK as someone changes their values, all other fvalues are forced to change
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Nope, only need one thing from the piston
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK my design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter)))
UNK_UNK What's your system FOS?
UNK_UNK what diameter should i use. i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of 97.5
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK Just did. I think that made it heavier
UNK_UNK we can make some spare weight elsewhere
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK Was 12 and 40 still your used numbers?
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK Okay update your D but try to keep it relatively low if possible
UNK_UNK okie
UNK_UNK I currently have it at the lowest, 150 am trying to run simulation to see how it affects the output values
UNK_UNK then we can ask someone to decrease mass
UNK_UNK try working more with FS if you can. Ours is so low
UNK_UNK What are your values?
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK Hey what do you have control over?
UNK_UNK yeah im not sure either. trying to find out
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
UNK_UNK so raising c increases mass and reduces fos
UNK_UNK and see
UNK_UNK What are your ranges?
UNK_UNK Thats a good option
UNK_UNK Try broadcasting 80
UNK_UNK let's get this bread
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK i have the crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
UNK_UNK and crank pin diameter
UNK_UNK on my screen it says quality is excellent
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK no just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK *your
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK Anything changing when you change your numbers now?
UNK_UNK are you limited by D to determine L? we may be able to increase D and reduc eL for a weigh tsavings.
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK Yeah I was about to ask that and i think you are right
UNK_UNK No neither of thos eaffect the crankshaft
UNK_UNK because my part weighs so little, ill just focus on the fos
UNK_UNK Is one of your variables bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Me neither. I think it was flywheel?
UNK_UNK whats the mass?
UNK_UNK for sure. go for it
UNK_UNK I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the FOS
UNK_UNK Currently I'm at 7.69
UNK_UNK I changed mine back
UNK_UNK how you doing
UNK_UNK cool we are good
UNK_UNK maybe we need to be secret
UNK_UNK we are soooo close
UNK_UNK the other thing is that i think heya is trying to get me and anisah to join her team so idk how this is gonna work out
UNK_UNK yep just did
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos when you maximize both your design variables
UNK_UNK no, i got my best value now
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK My flywheel is as small as possible. tf = 12 ds = 40. FOS is still in the thousands.
UNK_UNK my lowest fos is 1.46, max is 31.19
UNK_UNK i'm determining dc and c
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK Ok but what about the chart
UNK_UNK sorry
UNK_UNK fos>2 and m<35
UNK_UNK they updated it
UNK_UNK I mean, its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads. So that's normal.
UNK_UNK Way to be on top of things, I won't vote you off the island
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK as their ranges are also pretty small
UNK_UNK Anything else I can help optimse?
UNK_UNK yo, what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Are you happy with your piston diameter?
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually. So we cannot optimize that part.
UNK_UNK what values are you using for the input poston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK use thickness 10 and diameter 25 for now
UNK_UNK m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples FOS
UNK_UNK Ok.
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK we are using 75 mm rn
UNK_UNK k
UNK_UNK I have it set to max currently, so we may need to both be changing that
UNK_UNK how? are you broadcasting it?
UNK_UNK What's the best you can do with a flywheel shaft diameter of 45?
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK I told everyone that, but I think connector tod and piston pin guys left
UNK_UNK *back up 2
UNK_UNK D = 80 not 90
UNK_UNK impressive
UNK_UNK dang that fos is low
UNK_UNK what can we do to increase your FOS?
UNK_UNK uf
UNK_UNK can you get it above 2?\
UNK_UNK do you have your fos as close to 2
UNK_UNK does only the lowest person's Fos matter?
UNK_UNK Do your variables depend on piston bore diameter and piston head thickness?
UNK_UNK okay wait
UNK_UNK those are the same for me. Can you see any other variables? I can only see those 4
UNK_UNK Ok we're good I think
UNK_UNK what do you control!
UNK_UNK Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
UNK_UNK I'm on 0.69 now with a FOS of 3.84
UNK_UNK we need mass down a bit
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK c = 150 and dc = 45
UNK_UNK Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with?
UNK_UNK where do you see 90
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK No, that does not affect it either
UNK_UNK I let them know
UNK_UNK what r do you have for the pin?
UNK_UNK Nice.
UNK_UNK piston diameter
UNK_UNK under performance requirements
UNK_UNK 12 is the best I got
UNK_UNK i determine c and dc
UNK_UNK well, update your broadcast
UNK_UNK why did it go down?
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK Are you able to change the length and diameter of the piston?
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK What are your initial ideas for bearing offset?
UNK_UNK Ive changed it and I can sway the overall by roughly 0.1 by adding 0.03 mass
UNK_UNK using 85 and 15
UNK_UNK try and lower that mass
UNK_UNK What could i do to help your fos go up?
UNK_UNK bore diameter is 40mm
UNK_UNK That should be good
UNK_UNK I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter, I got these values by setting D = 45 
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK 25 mm
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK We were at excellent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter, so I used 70mm
UNK_UNK did you just increase your mass?
UNK_UNK Let me know if you change the bearing offset
UNK_UNK What happens when you decrease piston diameter?
UNK_UNK yes. I can get up to a FOS of 3 at 45 but only 1.23 at 47.5
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK okay I don't need either of those in my analysis
UNK_UNK piston is 0.83
UNK_UNK I got FOS 2 WITH 1.67 ms
UNK_UNK right now my mass is at .69 and my FS is 3.84
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK broadcasting
UNK_UNK i talked to the TA and the fos of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing. In other words, that number doesn't relate to a single person't part apparently
UNK_UNK Anything you need from me yet
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK our factor of safety went down
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK but piston pin designer has lopw fos
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK mine is a diameter and i think it relates to piston
UNK_UNK we are at excellent
UNK_UNK dang
UNK_UNK yet the mass the horrible lol
UNK_UNK we are at "Good" now
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK Yes. FOS looking good
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK I am at the time we got the best result now
UNK_UNK No. You have the lowest FOS at 1.92 currently
UNK_UNK or reduced offset i should say
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK #ERROR!
UNK_UNK I updated
UNK_UNK i have 2.7 FS and 57 mass
UNK_UNK oh alright
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK I'm communicating now
UNK_UNK I've been at 4 and right around 5.5-5.7 for all my broadcasts
UNK_UNK I will need the piston diameter
UNK_UNK have you talked to the crankshaft?
UNK_UNK Hello piston, based on my information, it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness (tf) and maximize flywheel shaft diameter (ds). Does this work with your design requirements?
UNK_UNK our mass is already 10kg too high
UNK_UNK our mass is the only thing to change now
UNK_UNK Ok I think right now we just need to decrease mass
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK yeah one sec
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK Alright thanks
UNK_UNK my weight is minimized completely fos = 1212
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK Got it thanks
UNK_UNK what are yourmass/fos
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK DONT MOVE
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK no boy we need both
UNK_UNK tbh i think it might be flywheel
UNK_UNK You have a lot of parameters to change, so try and run as many simulations as possible to try and find the sweet spot of mass and FOS
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK TA is saying time is up
UNK_UNK yeahh idk where they r at
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK i dropped 1 kg with 3 fos
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK my configuration has one of the lowest masses available atm
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from crankshaft?
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK Just did max, 105!
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK no only D
UNK_UNK I'm at fair quality. FOS is a bit low, total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though
UNK_UNK decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety
UNK_UNK Looks like they're working with 75 right now, but just forgot to broadcast.
UNK_UNK Hello, I do not
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK I currently have D set at 40
UNK_UNK heyhey
UNK_UNK Is there a way to lower that? Mass is way too high and FOS too low
UNK_UNK try increasing FOS
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK GROUP: keep communicating!
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod lenth and the crank lenth
UNK_UNK Is there a tf that works best for you?
UNK_UNK that wasn't me/ I am trying to shave off that little bit
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
UNK_UNK Same happened to me a bit ago
UNK_UNK We are hitting our requirements
UNK_UNK What is your max FOS? I think it would be worth it to try and get above 1
UNK_UNK go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
UNK_UNK End experiment, nice worK!
UNK_UNK Okay. great
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK fair
UNK_UNK We've gotta get crankshaft down. He's like all of our mass atm
UNK_UNK idk...
UNK_UNK can you lower the r values
UNK_UNK no worries
UNK_UNK it says very good
UNK_UNK ok \
UNK_UNK i havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK Are you referring to  the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
UNK_UNK wanna shoot for excellent? :P
UNK_UNK yeah I saw that, I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers
UNK_UNK were good
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK says very good
UNK_UNK because any FS over like 10 shouldnt really effect the system right
UNK_UNK Not from what I understand
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK yeah exactly
UNK_UNK yes i do
UNK_UNK 82.5, that is the second lowest for me
UNK_UNK I can change diameter if needed
UNK_UNK Do you need flywheel's thickness?
UNK_UNK mine is 2.47
UNK_UNK nice!
UNK_UNK i will compile
UNK_UNK mass is 3 and fos is 1.44
UNK_UNK I like it. I just broadcasted the parameter that has the highest FOS for my lowest possible weight
UNK_UNK No one change anything
UNK_UNK I can bump up FOS by like 2 for every 0.2g of mass I add. We just need to get the rest of the mass down
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK I'm trying to do that as well
UNK_UNK Cause we're still really high on weight
UNK_UNK Yeah that's what I've found too
UNK_UNK Yep, values finalized
UNK_UNK maybe lower if needed
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK so lower piston diamter lowers your fos?
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK also just realized that you and i are gonna have to figure out the quiz alone bc anisah left
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Are you having troubles with FOS?
UNK_UNK smaller gives me a much better fos
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK 4.55
UNK_UNK 2
UNK_UNK Alright
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK 82.5 actually
UNK_UNK at bore diameter of 40
UNK_UNK no problem
UNK_UNK what factors of the crank shaft?
UNK_UNK 1.26 but before it was 2.09
UNK_UNK Her, how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK Do you have any dependencies with others measurements that could help your values?
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK i changed to excellent
UNK_UNK got em
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK or she
UNK_UNK I haven't touched anything for a while
UNK_UNK im guessing flywheel
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Have you messaged the others about this yet?
UNK_UNK its 80 rn
UNK_UNK we may reduce D just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass
UNK_UNK slightly
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK Did you make that change?
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the piston-pin
UNK_UNK 2.26
UNK_UNK Okay, so your FS are in a slightly higher order
UNK_UNK can you trim a tiny bit more?
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK did you already push your broadcast?
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK i think its just the number of times youve broadcasted?
UNK_UNK who is in charge of piston pin
UNK_UNK Let me know when you are done changing D for a little while
UNK_UNK piston pin and flywheel are a little quiet and might not be interacting
UNK_UNK mass 1.97 fos 3.05
UNK_UNK Bore diameter increased
UNK_UNK is that your mass or FOS value
UNK_UNK possibly (as in yes)
UNK_UNK I see 2.73
UNK_UNK D= 47.4 or 40 for me
UNK_UNK 7.4
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK ok same. what is your current diameter size
UNK_UNK current mass is 1.46
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK on it
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK Whats your lowest mass?
UNK_UNK new phone who dis?
UNK_UNK so i got an fos of 3.39 and mass of 0.11
UNK_UNK Can we lower that? It might drop mass.
UNK_UNK No at most ill change it by 10, how much would a diameter of 50 affect your mass and FOS
UNK_UNK same as crankshaft
UNK_UNK We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
UNK_UNK Ok, trying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK Recheck your broadcast. it just went to poor
UNK_UNK Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel diameter
UNK_UNK Can you increase your diameter?
UNK_UNK Will making the bore diameter smaller improve your FOS?
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting new values?
UNK_UNK 1.35, I wonder who has 0.61
UNK_UNK whats your fos ?
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK so someone is a little confused
UNK_UNK piston diameter (D) is currently 105, not variable I control
UNK_UNK Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already?
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK just did!
UNK_UNK lets play tic tac toe (give me a sec)
UNK_UNK input shaft wheel diameter
UNK_UNK piston-pin has the lowest I believe, 1.67
UNK_UNK 5mm currently
UNK_UNK Is your offset still the same?
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK if you lower D I can raise the FOS with ds
UNK_UNK I can choose diameter between 75 and 105
UNK_UNK do you need to know flywheel parameters for your design?
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK current mass is 0.01 with fos 0.1
UNK_UNK what inputs do you control?
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK I can't decrease mass anymore without going below a FOS of 2
UNK_UNK its at 12, lowest
UNK_UNK i havnt changed anything, my variables seem to be the best so far
UNK_UNK I'll send a message too see if they'll respond
UNK_UNK For lower mass I could make it 40, it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn't affect FOS as much
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve fos some with other parts
UNK_UNK ds tf and D
UNK_UNK i dont have 85, i have 82.5
UNK_UNK c is bearing support offset
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK it got worse so i would change it back
UNK_UNK dc is the weight variable for me
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Have you broadcasted your most recent design?
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK try that
UNK_UNK piston told me, crankshaft want him to have miximum diameter
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK global just changed to 1.17
UNK_UNK does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK try bearing offset = 180, crankshaft pin is 35 mm
UNK_UNK whats the best fos you've had?
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK he and i talked
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK I have c and dc what do you control?
UNK_UNK broadcasting 2.85 with a mass of 1.36
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK oh okay
UNK_UNK slim if you can without altering your fos at all
UNK_UNK its bleow 40 and above 2
UNK_UNK Do you need either of those?
UNK_UNK tf-27
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK tf value of 10
UNK_UNK lmk if you change it
UNK_UNK I'll prioritize on increasing FS
UNK_UNK nvm looks good
UNK_UNK go with 90
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK so maybe try lowering your fos a lil bit with smaller mass
UNK_UNK We need to save weight.
UNK_UNK We're good
UNK_UNK sure!, I'm trying to play with c to get a higher FOS
UNK_UNK Nice!
UNK_UNK at 0.1
UNK_UNK Im working on the connecting rod. Honestly just trying to figure out how to start
UNK_UNK Looks like were close again now
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK oh okay, sounds good
UNK_UNK is 60 the minimum you can go with the crankshaft
UNK_UNK do you think increase fos of lighter componet while decreasing fos of my part will work?
UNK_UNK not me, at lowest weight possible
UNK_UNK time is up i believe
UNK_UNK Alright, I will try to figure that out
UNK_UNK what's your mass
UNK_UNK yeah Im doing that after every sim, we're already in the very good range
UNK_UNK piston pin designer is having trouble maxing out his fos
UNK_UNK without going above D = 42
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Same. Minimizing the piston bore would help me push stuff further down.
UNK_UNK ds and tf yes
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
UNK_UNK bc thats the lowest and system level fos
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK 9.09
UNK_UNK Have you changed the diameter at all?
UNK_UNK do we just sit here now?
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK check for broadcast?
UNK_UNK I MEAN INCREASE
UNK_UNK whaddup
UNK_UNK 5.2
UNK_UNK Thanks! good job!
UNK_UNK got it, thanks
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK The only thing that affects my design is the bore diameter so we're all good. Are you affected by r2 or r3?
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
UNK_UNK u mean 80?
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK Okay good, I'm at 85 too
UNK_UNK Has the crankshaft got back to you about his FOS?
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK wait*
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK Sorry, what is your current length
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Great - makes sense.  that's my job lol
UNK_UNK very bad change
UNK_UNK Thank you. Will you please update me if it changes by more than 5?
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK I haven't touched any
UNK_UNK thickness is 10 and diameter is 22
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK crank is 30 lbs alone
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK is your fos still 2.01 ?
UNK_UNK mass 1.66 fos 1.64
UNK_UNK My strategy was to pick the part with lowest weight and factor of safety above 2
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK shows it as broadcasting for me
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting it?
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK Yeah. Im on the second lightest option
UNK_UNK We are good now
UNK_UNK piston
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK it updates the global model
UNK_UNK alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
UNK_UNK I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality
UNK_UNK looks like we're good
UNK_UNK yes, let's do one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK the other parts weigh 0.1,0.06,0.52 and 0.99
UNK_UNK Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
UNK_UNK hi, what are your working on?
UNK_UNK I am getting around 2.26-2.95
UNK_UNK When you broadcast, does that just update the overall model with the design you selected for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK though i guess it's more efficient mass than the shaft
UNK_UNK my fos(s) is 9193.31
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK t = 8
UNK_UNK Mass is at a min. FOS is still about 4700
UNK_UNK right now, I am at 20
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40
UNK_UNK I think the flywheel is changing
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK who r u
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK okay im at max fos
UNK_UNK The piston pin length, and the inner and outer diameter of the of the piston pin 
UNK_UNK piston have control over diameter as well, I need the diameter for my variables
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK We need to meet at least one of these criteria
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK Gotcha. This is harder than if we had a group chat \
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK dec mass
UNK_UNK Only the piston diameter D affects my part
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK good job team
UNK_UNK Piston pin designer said it is in very good range
UNK_UNK what is the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK that's what the piston guy is saying
UNK_UNK i have set it to those values
UNK_UNK whats your fos ?
UNK_UNK WE are GOOD
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK yea what we have right now is perfect
UNK_UNK yeah they won't respond to my chats either
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK ya'' should chat about that
UNK_UNK idk
UNK_UNK 2.01 still
UNK_UNK Oops, my thickness is 10 mm
UNK_UNK I'm going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass, we're not doing too bad with fos
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75to see what happens
UNK_UNK FOS is just whoever has the lowest value
UNK_UNK I haven't changed anything yet
UNK_UNK wait we're at very good
UNK_UNK whats the max diamter
UNK_UNK Increasing C only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start. Do you need it bigger>
UNK_UNK I'll try to bring it down
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK do you have ds?
UNK_UNK lets get this bread
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK We can make that happen
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS?
UNK_UNK fos went up to 2.22 and mass went up to 37.56 from 35. something
UNK_UNK Can you set the piston bore diameter to 85 and get a good fos?
UNK_UNK mine says Very Good
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK is your objectives different?
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK I'm using 47.5
UNK_UNK D, ds, and tf
UNK_UNK use 15 for now as I try to find better values on my end
UNK_UNK we are so close
UNK_UNK i have thickness of flywheel as 12mm and 60mm for shaft diameter
UNK_UNK oh
UNK_UNK 1643.92?
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK did you change your mass a lot just now
UNK_UNK we have exceleent
UNK_UNK the mass of the piston is currently 2.23
UNK_UNK Hello, Do you need any parameters from me? 
UNK_UNK hmm okay i will talk with others
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK were they significantly different twenty minutes ago?
UNK_UNK did u get the light sensor working
UNK_UNK try reducing C?
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK connecting rod: hold on, piston pin changing!
UNK_UNK thickness = 8
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK dont change anything
UNK_UNK ok im going to bump mind to midrange to see how much the mass increases
UNK_UNK So what is your c value?
UNK_UNK as long as you dont dramatically decrease your Fs because i think most oif it is coming from you
UNK_UNK the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get fos to like 0.89
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK What other parameters do you have? Other than C
UNK_UNK before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK I changed to 0.37, fos of 11.
UNK_UNK It says currently broadcasting 42 on my end
UNK_UNK *So if I decrease mass, FOS will decrease by 10000. So I would not do anything
UNK_UNK Is higher or lower D better for you?
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK still maxed at 1.23
UNK_UNK we need smaller mass
UNK_UNK Yea I believe so.
UNK_UNK What about you?
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK 2.47
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK i shit you not lol.
UNK_UNK KK
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK Im currently broadcasting c 60 dc 10 which is m .99 and fos .67
UNK_UNK Reduces mass let me see what i can do
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK something changed we were closer
UNK_UNK you there
UNK_UNK 17.5?
UNK_UNK What would you like?
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK They said they'd broadcast it, but yeah, still 80. IDK what's going on.
UNK_UNK Crankshaft is at 1.49 for m
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK Sounds great to me. With my current design, mass is 0.53 and Fs is 2.1
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK X X O ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK thickness is 10 mm
UNK_UNK 58
UNK_UNK im at 2.36 for fos
UNK_UNK how's your FOS looking
UNK_UNK its up to 1.7 now so getting there
UNK_UNK I agree
UNK_UNK Perfect, I can play around with that. Let me know if anything changes
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK doth D and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass
UNK_UNK are you making any changes ?
UNK_UNK Moving bore diameter down to 55, that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on FOS as much. Rod designer is cool with it
UNK_UNK kmaybe not
UNK_UNK I spent a lot of time staring at it questioning my basic knowledge of engineering so I'd recommend starting haha
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK Based on their mass of 1.66, they take up half the weight of the system. So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important.
UNK_UNK can you increase C value to max i wanna see how it effects my values
UNK_UNK yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back
UNK_UNK Whats your fos?
UNK_UNK yeah, what is it?
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK ey ywe did it
UNK_UNK alright, let me find my  ideal values based on the 40
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK i was using the max but am running simulations for a smaller value currently
UNK_UNK whats your fos now?
UNK_UNK actually keep 45 for crankshaft
UNK_UNK Will experiment
UNK_UNK the broadcast still shows 40
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
UNK_UNK oh ok yeah neither can mine haha
UNK_UNK huh I would ask a TA then,
UNK_UNK i see poor?
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK and my variables are thickness of connecting rod and ratio of length of connecting rod and crank length
UNK_UNK Can you change back to what you had before. The fos needs to increase.
UNK_UNK does a larger bore increase your FOS?
UNK_UNK only the crankshaft offset
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK Great
UNK_UNK go for it
UNK_UNK aight do you need any connector rod info?
UNK_UNK I'm using (0.7, 0.7) at the moment
UNK_UNK Our mass just increased a lot
UNK_UNK also piston guy is using D=40
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you. That is the highest FOS I have found
UNK_UNK Yes that is what I have input
UNK_UNK the smaller those two values are, the lighter the part is, but it gets weaker
UNK_UNK Lmao thats massive
UNK_UNK 0.06
UNK_UNK No one change anything
UNK_UNK Changing D from 40 to 70 lowers the FOS drastically like ~ 3.0 but lowers the mass just a bit like ~ 0.1kg
UNK_UNK yeah right now i have a piston diameter of 90 and head thickness of 7.25
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out, it seems really large
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK and one sec for the other one
UNK_UNK mine is 1.48
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK "however D will need to increase to compensate for the reduced FOS"
UNK_UNK really?
UNK_UNK My values of 150 and 50 are getting me highest fos and lowest mass
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
UNK_UNK blackmail
UNK_UNK .52. it's minimized
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77
UNK_UNK let me know if you change it at all
UNK_UNK yeah i cant change anything. We done?
UNK_UNK group: who wants to go next?
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK nope. thanks.
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK can you broadcaset 150?
UNK_UNK wow!
UNK_UNK I control the r values
UNK_UNK I just bumped mine up
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK How's the design going? I think we got to an excellent rating already!
UNK_UNK great, thanks!
UNK_UNK maybe, I'll try to go back
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting those values?
UNK_UNK Yup..
UNK_UNK Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin?
UNK_UNK 1215
UNK_UNK We need FOS to be around 1.5
UNK_UNK poor of me to assume
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK I've just been clicking refresh for the last 20 minutes haha
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK nor crankshaft
UNK_UNK for ds tf and stuff
UNK_UNK We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
UNK_UNK the equation of the ratio R1 = (connector rod)/(crank length)
UNK_UNK I think you're right
UNK_UNK is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you?
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK someone changed it again
UNK_UNK I am not sure
UNK_UNK you change let me lose 5 lbs! Thanks fellow engineer!!!
UNK_UNK I lowered the r values. It did lower the weight, but the FOS is too low now
UNK_UNK I just dont know why our FS is so low
UNK_UNK 40 mm
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK back to poor
UNK_UNK if i go for a lower mass we don't pass the fos
UNK_UNK end*
UNK_UNK I think so too
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK my current c i 150 and dc of 30
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK i can get my mass between 0.5 and 0.6, and still have a pretty high FOS
UNK_UNK What are the the piston bore diameter are we making?
UNK_UNK but the weight incresases too
UNK_UNK hey, im seeing the Crankshaft bearing support offset to be 60.0mm, is this what you got 
UNK_UNK What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
UNK_UNK ^^^^^
UNK_UNK can you reduce mass but keep FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK what's your fos ?
UNK_UNK im not surprised,he has a pretty big head
UNK_UNK it is the lowest diameter i could do
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK larger piston bore increases both m and fos
UNK_UNK What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK What can I change to help improve your design?
UNK_UNK *tho
UNK_UNK It does not affect my part
UNK_UNK down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK No i think its fine i was just curious
UNK_UNK Thanks, I'll run some simulations with those numbers
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK well mine is only related to yours.
UNK_UNK Ok thank you.
UNK_UNK I dont have any other dependent variables
UNK_UNK mass = 1.27, fos_s=13238
UNK_UNK nope dont thing so
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK My simulation would be excellent, the broadcast was very good and now poor?
UNK_UNK wait now we're very good
UNK_UNK Did you change something?
UNK_UNK with my current dimensions mass is 1.2 and FOS is 15886.04
UNK_UNK haha good can't wait to go work on this lab
UNK_UNK alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past 1.23 FOS
UNK_UNK any changes?
UNK_UNK 10.7
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK I'm not sure why they aren't updating though when I change my input values
UNK_UNK haven't changed anything on my ene
UNK_UNK seems like it
UNK_UNK lmao ya i noticed
UNK_UNK raising it now
UNK_UNK ok make sure your fos is never below 2
UNK_UNK yes. with a mass of 0.1
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting 2.77
UNK_UNK anyway to reduce mass while keeping fos above 2?
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK c bc yes
UNK_UNK bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK did you get FOS as 1.81?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK I am working on setting the thickness of the I section of the connecting rod and the Conrod length to crank length ratio. What about you?
UNK_UNK If I drop my weight way down though my fos is super trash
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain FOS
UNK_UNK I am thinking 82.5 which is the second smallest
UNK_UNK communication is key my brotha
UNK_UNK shoot
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK yes I am
UNK_UNK Ok, is he working on fixing it?
