OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS sounds good
OOS 150 is working pretty well for me right now
OOS 85 right now
OOS Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS What's the mass that you are using?
OOS Kind of, increasing thickness increases FOS
OOS okay im at max fos
OOS Nicole who dis?
OOS My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone  Send
OOS *back up 2
OOS FOS is 2.85
OOS whats your FOS if you dropped mass by 3kg
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS Do you know whose FOS is the lowest at the moment?
OOS so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS not me
OOS lol i think its flywheel haha
OOS ok!
OOS i think its just the number of times youve broadcasted?
OOS ok so your mass should be fine. not a big contributing factor
OOS can you share your equations?
OOS Group- only piston engineer edits
OOS I think that will be the crankshaft!
OOS 0.57
OOS we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
OOS Still 40mm. Will increasing bore help your design?
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS does that work well for you?
OOS group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
OOS 2.77 is my minimum mass and fos I'm afraid
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more
OOS fos>2 and m<35
OOS Hello.  Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
OOS crankshaft a lil suspicious too
OOS Hello
OOS just 0.12
OOS it is at 150
OOS As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
OOS im trying to figure out who has the min FOS
OOS Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
OOS Ok let me know if you change that because it will effect my design
OOS Is there anything related to an increase/decrease in mass/fos on your end?
OOS man 0.09 fos lol
OOS for c?
OOS No. You have the lowest FOS at 1.92 currently
OOS try to increase your FS
OOS sorry hit the wrong button fixed it
OOS So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
OOS gives excellent
OOS yeah i have no clue
OOS Nope, havent changed anything
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS Okay. I played around with it at the beginning and I don't think my FOS has a huge affect on the overall FOS. My mass is only 3.17, and my FOS is at 2. That's where I thought I would keep it for now.
OOS yo bro
OOS 5.82
OOS what mass are you using?
OOS So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
OOS our mass is too high rn
OOS It just looks like the FOS went down a lot
OOS the $20 we just won
OOS or it
OOS lets try 90
OOS what is your mass rn
OOS my time is up
OOS looking good
OOS my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
OOS we have exceleent
OOS Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
OOS so hows life
OOS current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
OOS is your design at the lowest possible weight?
OOS didnt change anything
OOS 1.75 and 6.07
OOS i asked
OOS crankshaft is talking, but he/she depends on flywheel
OOS that wasnt me
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS Moving bore diameter down to 55, that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on FOS as much. Rod designer is cool with it
OOS did you already push your broadcast?
OOS then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and FOS
OOS trying
OOS Will do
OOS FS optimization would be best. Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low FS
OOS 0.55
OOS excellent?
OOS Sounds good
OOS no i do not
OOS What are your design variables currently?
OOS perfect
OOS everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
OOS what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
OOS Pick a threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
OOS bc thats the lowest and system level fos
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS shoot
OOS I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
OOS 20.86 (mass of .6)
OOS current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
OOS mass is 1.18 and thats with both as low as they can get
OOS X|_|O
OOS Are you happy with your piston diameter?
OOS ok conrod's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
OOS okay
OOS what is your fos
OOS Is there anything I can do to help you?
OOS okay
OOS stop changing
OOS our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
OOS group: i changed my part!
OOS In D = 75?
OOS what is your current mass and fos?
OOS Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
OOS nvmd
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS Our mass is too high again
OOS lets leave it like this
OOS Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
OOS My strategy was to pick the part with lowest weight and factor of safety above 2
OOS ok. Im just trying to figure out how it all works together, I was talking with someone else and sometimes when I optimize my part it hurts the overall system
OOS I think 75 is the best right now
OOS What variables do you control?
OOS yes
OOS we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
OOS C does not affect the mass. However, as you increase C the factor of safety decreases
OOS 10 bucks aint bad
OOS sweet!
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
OOS Yes please!
OOS nah man he chill
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS great
OOS idk my FOS at 2 and weight minimized
OOS Hey, what are the updates you would have on the piston bore diameter if any
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS ok somehow we now have way too much mass
OOS Does it kill the FOS if you decrease the offset below 150?
OOS message back when you did it
OOS I used 70mm. Try to update yours
OOS Okay
OOS D =75
OOS I havnt changed anything
OOS yeah same
OOS Yea. I am working with my numbers to try and fix that.
OOS do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
OOS Yes, my most recent design is what is broadcasted
OOS yeah it does now
OOS whoever changed it change back
OOS can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
OOS im at what ive always been at
OOS so it looks like our mass is killing us now
OOS its the smallest I can go
OOS Thank you. Will you please update me if it changes by more than 5?
OOS im at what ive always been at
OOS Yeah, what parameters are you designing for?
OOS I control bearing support offset (c) and crank-pin diameter (d_c))
OOS Is higher or lower D better for you?
OOS that is a lot, between you and the piston, you guys have the majority of the weight
OOS yeah i cant change anything. We done?
OOS flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
OOS that's what the piston guy is saying
OOS Hey, let me know if you need anything from me
OOS I need to find two fitting ratios, r2 and r3. As these are increased, the both the mass and FOS decrease
OOS 7X7 fun
OOS Piston diameter and thickness
OOS With 0.12 mass.
OOS Yeah the mass looks like a problem
OOS why did it go down?
OOS cZ i was gonna try 80
OOS ur not wrong
OOS 2.47
OOS It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
OOS agreed
OOS ok cool
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS What variables/equations do you deal with?
OOS are we all selected?
OOS you can maximize the crank shaft bearing support offset if it benefits your design, it decreases my Fos but my FOS is so high that it doesnt matter much
OOS how do I broadcast?
OOS back to poor
OOS Do you need info from me
OOS my FOS is 2.01
OOS who changed
OOS yes i changed my numbers
OOS I say we stop changing
OOS I have not decided on them yet.
OOS we need to get this puppy down
OOS flywheel, are you good?
OOS )group: we are at good! hold on!
OOS time is up it says on my system
OOS OK
OOS what mass are you getting?
OOS haven't changed anything on my ene
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS wait in the complete range?
OOS we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
OOS we are in excellent right now
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS how much weight can you trim (generally)
OOS Do I have any variables that affect your result?
OOS yes agreed
OOS my time is up
OOS go back to the value you had and itll go back
OOS Yes. My current design has a mass of 0.53 and a Fs of 2.1
OOS maybe lower if needed
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS whats the best fos you've had?
OOS agreed
OOS I'll try lowering my mass some
OOS My current fos in my table is 1.11
OOS im so confused what happened
OOS OK
OOS Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
OOS yes, an old version, I'm running the simulations you requested noe
OOS for D = 85, min mass is 3.4
OOS 2.42
OOS how did the mass go up
OOS ?
OOS Can I have a current value of D
OOS 2.03 for fos
OOS do you need r2 or r3?
OOS FOS = 2.01
OOS 3.11
OOS total
OOS D is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
OOS c bc yes
OOS so yes smaller piston diameter improves my fos
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS same
OOS Heaviest Ms: 3.64 Highest FS: 6.92
OOS Hi Kamran
OOS ;)
OOS I've kept my numbers steady for a while
OOS what option are you currently on
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS No, looks like that L and r are different than mine.
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod lenth and the crank lenth
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on FOS
OOS No
OOS thickness = 10
OOS according to the thing on the screen it says very good
OOS 37.46 and 2.06
OOS My apologies, Plots were not showing up for me originally.  I'm on it
OOS I have not
OOS Yeah it is in good range
OOS FOS/
OOS im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
OOS yeah :/
OOS bore diameter is 40mm
OOS Quality very good Nice!
OOS What's the best crankshaft offset?
OOS cool
OOS Do you have a value for the bore diameter?
OOS really?
OOS whenever I lower my factor of safety it seems to be having a large effect on the overall value for just a small change in mass
OOS Do you need to increase it?
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS what do you need
OOS hey what are your values?
OOS how does diameter affect your part?
OOS Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
OOS m = 0.16, fos = 4.66
OOS ok
OOS that makes sense.  i just maxed my fos right now
OOS what diam are you using
OOS wont let me
OOS I'm using (0.7, 0.7) at the moment
OOS hello?
OOS ok i got fos 2.02 and mass of 5.82
OOS it is the lowest diameter i could do
OOS and crank pin diameter
OOS Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
OOS woah were at poor now
OOS I cant
OOS FOS just went down
OOS Keep 70 mm I'm trying to get out of the poor region
OOS I think you need to try changing that variable and seeing if you can get a higher FOS
OOS _|_|O
OOS Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS piston diameter
OOS mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
OOS seems to be maximized at 2.62 ill keep trying other values
OOS M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
OOS what is your weight at 75 and what is it at 80?
OOS back to very good
OOS although the new broadcast increased the mass
OOS Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
OOS barely communicating
OOS okay
OOS What are your values?
OOS Your FOS is huge
OOS what parameters do you have?
OOS 45
OOS is your objectives different?
OOS What affects your mass the most?
OOS Yeah flywheel isn't communicating
OOS ds and tf yes
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS we should always report current fos
OOS recheck it
OOS FOS no
OOS truuu
OOS I can also change tH
OOS what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
OOS Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
OOS I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, what are you looking at?
OOS I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
OOS Our mass is too high right now
OOS yeah
OOS I have broadcasted the best value
OOS nevermind, back at excellent now.
OOS im tryin g90 mm
OOS It's up
OOS right, but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations? Do you have one?
OOS ms = 6.72?
OOS Flywheel prob
OOS At max FOS
OOS how about FOS?
OOS i agree with that
OOS yes
OOS Yeah I am happy with this gg
OOS Looks like they're working with 75 right now, but just forgot to broadcast.
OOS whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
OOS just did it
OOS It's the same tradeoff for everyone
OOS they've been awfullly quiet
OOS Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all?
OOS awesome, thanks
OOS nobody change anythibn
OOS any preference on the piston bore diameter
OOS I do the control ds but its the same
OOS fos is bad
OOS Smaller diameter is better for me
OOS one sec
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS Good working with you too
OOS who moved
OOS do we just sit here now?
OOS (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
OOS Have you changed your values any?
OOS have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS is bore diameter piston diameter
OOS oh alright
OOS weight is 0.86
OOS Cool
OOS )group: we are at good! hold on!
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS try using 50 mm
OOS I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
OOS Hello, What parameters do you need from me
OOS aiming for a Fs slightly above 2 will let us minimize the mass and have a shot at the "very good
OOS Our FOS just went down to 0.96. Is yours still good?
OOS Bore diameter increased
OOS Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values?
OOS what is your current and fos/
OOS what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
OOS are the dimensions still the same
OOS yeah agreed
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS I did not
OOS sounds good, flywheel now needs to check theirs i think
OOS we reached good
OOS Thats great, let's see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
OOS that will increase my mass, which is where we are too high
OOS lmao ya i noticed
OOS i refuse to go back to those lectures so im just gonna wait
OOS cool. not touching anything
OOS My sim shows m=29.24, f=2.83
OOS I asked the guy, he said it was normal
OOS Thank you
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS no
OOS 51 and 1.1 my values keep getting messed up
OOS it doesnt have to be that high
OOS What are the the piston bore diameter are we making?
OOS and then I depend on ds, t_f, and D
OOS Can you try decreasing diameter back to 45?
OOS sure!, I'm trying to play with c to get a higher FOS
OOS maybe we should just call it good
OOS greatjob
OOS Whats your current diameter?
OOS exactly
OOS my variables depend on piston bore diameter
OOS can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
OOS thanks!! you too!
OOS hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
OOS we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
OOS piston diameter is 75, thickness is 10.5
OOS your part seems to be using the most mass so I'd say worry about that rather than FOS and see if the others can bump it up
OOS these are the variables I need to consider for design
OOS what is your mass/fos
OOS my highest FS is 1.23
OOS Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
OOS just went up to .51 overall
OOS We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
OOS yes
OOS what variable can you change  for "change variables of other sub-systems?"
OOS The current weight of my part is 0.1, so changing it won't affect it a whole lot.
OOS 2.85
OOS New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
OOS Oh I see, yea I'll work on that now
OOS and im kamran
OOS I can hold mine above 2 and reduce but me having a high FOS might brign the overall up for not much more mass
OOS c=150, dc=45
OOS Between 45 and 50 would be wonderful!
OOS M = 6.72
OOS So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
OOS i have 2.7 FS and 57 mass
OOS do you need anything from me?
OOS my fos is still 700 so we can trim something on my end
OOS yup thats working!
OOS there is a default one but i'm trying to figure out how to change it
OOS hello?
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS looks like we both need bore diameter from piston
OOS idk...
OOS agreed
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS I've had it at the first one, but it says you may need my thickness to change
OOS Recheck your broadcast. it just went to poor
OOS what variables do you control?
OOS if you increase the diameter, the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS earlier we had pretty good results with a bore diameter of 75mm, should we give that a try again?
OOS Thank you
OOS For D =85, what was your mass
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS ok the lower you have it the higher my Fos
OOS Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
OOS On it
OOS mass is 1.7 and fos is 3.5
OOS 75 mm is the bore diameter
OOS to do that should I lower r, which could lower our FOS too much
OOS Ok sounds good
OOS are your masses high
OOS Yes
OOS Check for broadcast now
OOS if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
OOS Hello
OOS ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples FOS
OOS If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
OOS it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at 2.03, so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety, that would be ideal
OOS lets decrease mass
OOS Piston-pin seems solid
OOS whats your mass at the moment
OOS Flywheel guy is also in on it
OOS Okay let's keep it at that then
OOS is your fs still 2.1?
OOS they updated it
OOS They are t_I and r_1.
OOS okay, try and get the FOS even higher - we need to at least meet one of these criteria
OOS makes it way worse
OOS i changed to excellent
OOS anyone know why it went back to poor?
OOS shows it as broadcasting for me
OOS Rolid, really solid
OOS just leave it im fine with very good
OOS No I do flywheel diameter
OOS my stats for flywheel are as follow
OOS I am at the time we got the best result now
OOS same and im currently there
OOS 6.61
OOS I'll try
OOS i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
OOS we can tone it down some still
OOS D = 90
OOS It should be our lowest FS, but it's 0.51 instead of 2
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
OOS 1.27
OOS 2.06
OOS c = 85 and dc = 15
OOS Nope must be the other two that need that
OOS Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
OOS are you chaning values and updating your broadcast?
OOS 1.35, I wonder who has 0.61
OOS mass
OOS did you  broadcast your value?
OOS ya the fos is so bad
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS ok just making sure it updates
OOS If you decrease you piston diameter does it decrease mass and FOS?
OOS I think so too
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS nice
OOS thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
OOS Can we lower that? It might drop mass.
OOS Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
OOS duh
OOS Yeah we just need mass to go down
OOS haven't changed anything on my end, that's weird
OOS will let you know in few minutes
OOS did you change your mass a lot just now
OOS what is your FOS
OOS ok can u tell everyone that we agreed to move? i will also!
OOS well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
OOS And the mass for my component is 0.55
OOS by the way, I can get an fs of 10.19 if you go down to 75
OOS I'm pretty sure no one depends on my variables though
OOS okay, i havent updated in awhile
OOS really?
OOS is your fos still 2.01 ?
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS Yea I just asked him
OOS Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
OOS Thanks. What's your FOS?
OOS I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the fos
OOS grp-im done
OOS yea we're at excellent
OOS Where is your FOS at?
OOS Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
OOS why
OOS I have piston-pin length and piston pin diameter, so let me know if youd like me to change any of those values
OOS Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
OOS Ok.
OOS what is your fos?
OOS sounds good
OOS I am not sure
OOS yes
OOS Not by much. I can find values that work for it quickly
OOS I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
OOS I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
OOS i dont think so
OOS yup trying 85 now
OOS and a tH of 10.5
OOS are you changing anything ?
OOS Hey
OOS can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
OOS my current fos is 1.35, conrod has 7.69, what do you have?
OOS Me neither. I think it was flywheel?
OOS What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
OOS I think were good. We are at the highest point we can be. Good job!
OOS my masss is 6.28
OOS 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
OOS You have bore diameter too?
OOS I agree, I also can change the Piston head thickness.
OOS Which part do you think has the most mass? mine is small but i can chang FOS a lot
OOS Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS i talked to the TA and the fos of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing. In other words, that number doesn't relate to a single person't part apparently
OOS piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
OOS Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
OOS Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
OOS we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
OOS I don't think it is
OOS My part only accounts for only 0.1 so I can't do much for mass
OOS I changed my FOS to around 30 by adding 0.07 kg
OOS interesting
OOS DONT CHANGE
OOS yeah drop that to like 1.5 if you can
OOS i know
OOS do you have the 1.65 fos?
OOS what are your mass/fos
OOS Have you made any progress on the piston diameter D?
OOS no only on piston bore diameter
OOS our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
OOS Brendan
OOS true. what's your mass?
OOS I think so
OOS can you get that FOS up?
OOS I broadcasted something but then i changed it now
OOS Broadcast your latest values
OOS Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
OOS Our mass just increased a lot
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS X _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ _ _
OOS DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
OOS Did you change something?
OOS are you still updating mass? we were in excellent
OOS mine is 2.44
OOS maybe use a  smaller c
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS I think we can keep going
OOS That's alright, as long as we have a FOS above 2
OOS dont change anything hahah
OOS Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel diameter
OOS Ok now it dropped
OOS No
OOS _|_|o
OOS I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
OOS message back when you did it
OOS 0.1 to 3.24 for mass, 1.72 to 54.23 for FS.
OOS Flywheel guy is also in on it
OOS higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
OOS okay so my FOS is over 2000 for any design parameters and the mass is less than 2 so I can't figure out how my design affects everyone
OOS mm
OOS ?
OOS yeah
OOS most of mass is in piston and flywheel
OOS I need to change D to 85 though
OOS Thanks!
OOS how does the piston bore diameter affect your equations?
OOS DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
OOS whats your name fam?
OOS 6.45 now
OOS ok
OOS m=0.07 FOS=1.23
OOS mine are piston diameter and head thickness
OOS by about .7 or 1
OOS rip too late
OOS Lost a great deal on FOS.
OOS hello
OOS We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS larger has a better FOS but the currently I used 45 and it's just high enough
OOS i'm determining dc and c
OOS Mass is 0.1 right?
OOS the other values on our team are like between 2.5 and 5000
OOS crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter, so I used 70mm
OOS does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
OOS its just flywheel that is rich apparently and can afford to experiment
OOS Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
OOS did you change anything?>
OOS whoever changed please go back
OOS does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
OOS sorry i wrote backwards, increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
OOS I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used
OOS We need to get the fos higher even if it means the mass is greater than 35
OOS Nice!
OOS ok same
OOS nor crankshaft
OOS i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
OOS on it
OOS try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
OOS What is the piston bore diameter?
OOS 40 inches currently
OOS crankshaft weighs the most i think
OOS I'd minimzie mass
OOS I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do
OOS very big
OOS my mass is pretty low already. But make sure to broadcast variables
OOS We're good\
OOS I'm using 47.5
OOS lets try only  small changes now since we are at very good, maybe make it to excellent
OOS wow ok
OOS Wanna call it?
OOS What is your FOS right now?
OOS If I increase the Piston Diameter, how much will it affect your FOS
OOS I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
OOS all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
OOS group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
OOS Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
OOS M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
OOS oh dang
OOS im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety
OOS t1 or tf?
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS So you want to minimize mass, but increase FOS?
OOS Ok, that's odd
OOS Oh ok mine just updated
OOS any good values for the piston bore D?
OOS they just not responding to messages?
OOS now mass is 1.18
OOS group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
OOS I currently have D set at 40
OOS heyhey
OOS yes, do you need that changed?
OOS Don't change anything
OOS Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
OOS min with highest fos
OOS Each part should be at 2
OOS ok
OOS Im at 12 60 now.
OOS and we are just trying to optimize somehow?
OOS sweet
OOS 2.77
OOS 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
OOS sounds good
OOS "Good"
OOS fos went up
OOS I haven't broadcasted yet ho
OOS yeet
OOS we can try smaller mass
OOS Yep just got paid
OOS Me too
OOS and which do you need
OOS i did try it a few minutes ago, did anythjing change? Ill try it again
OOS we are so close
OOS We were at excellent and now poor, did you change anything?
OOS Is there any way you can lower your weight?
OOS I think we should be good, just don't change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
OOS For the current bore diameter, yes. If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results
OOS adjust which part?
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS okay so the piston and I also have that variable and we have it at 47.5 currently
OOS That's what I'm altering
OOS we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
OOS once you figure it out
OOS I haven't it increases mass and decreases FOS so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn't make sense on my end
OOS I don't think so
OOS how much does your fos increase though? because then we could save mass in other parts
OOS Also, what is optimal in terms of parameters for you?
OOS cats game
OOS We need to meet at least one of these criteria
OOS Maybe? My pin length is called l1 (el 1) and I also control the inner and outer diameter of the pin (d0 and di)
OOS #ERROR!
OOS hmm
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS our weight is too high
OOS were they significantly different twenty minutes ago?
OOS Got and idea for the flywheel thickness?
OOS go back to what you had bc we were at very good
OOS What are you using as your diameter
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS not anymore. do you have control over D?
OOS me either
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
OOS do you wanna lower the mass further to see what we get or no?
OOS diameter is 25
OOS Im on mine rn with 0.1
OOS whats it to u
OOS New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
OOS ok
OOS no
OOS Tractor king
OOS we can optimize c and tf looks like
OOS got it
OOS is this scooter
OOS D = 85, M = 6.72
OOS might be piston
OOS but piston pin designer has lopw fos
OOS GOOD
OOS ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
OOS flywheel is 0.52 currently
OOS I think I have the easiest part lol.  No one's asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them
OOS ok somehow we now have way too much mass
OOS What just changed?
OOS rn my mass is 6.5 and fos is 2.09
OOS its fine now
OOS Actually its better now
OOS Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
OOS nope
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS I mean, its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads. So that's normal.
OOS like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
OOS are you using my dc dimension?
OOS what is yours?
OOS Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
OOS but im strugling with mass
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS What weight are you at?
OOS and keep D lower
OOS there ya go
OOS I'm using 85 so my mass now is 6.72
OOS its as small as itll go
OOS our factor of safety went down
OOS what about the fos?
OOS you need to change your current broadcast
OOS enough money for me
OOS have you reached an ideal value for your part yet?
OOS piston range is pretty high
OOS Do we want to end with very good?
OOS 20.86
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS YOurs is currently the bottleneck
OOS on my broadcast thing theyre just called r2 and r3.  r2 is the ratio of piston pin length to diameter and r3 is piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
OOS basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
OOS (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
OOS hey did you find a diameter for the piston bore?
OOS try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
OOS mine is 1215
OOS The lowest offset possible would be ideal for the mass and FoS for the crankshaft
OOS can you please share your design variables so that we know what each needs
OOS I think that works, i'm not sure how that affects the flyweel but I will change it to offset of 60 which is minimum
OOS so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
OOS "Select a design to broadcast"
OOS I haven't changed the broadcast for awhile, it must be someone else
OOS I will ask others
OOS since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
OOS The crankshaft has FOS = 3.05 and mass = 1.33 and that's about the lowest mass I can get with FOS > 2
OOS i didnt
OOS we need to cut down on mass
OOS I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS ok my m is .53 and fos is 1929
OOS hmm
OOS hello?
OOS I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
OOS I am getting around 2.26-2.95
OOS mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
OOS No, i dont think so. I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter 
OOS ds = 50
OOS Done
OOS try not to change anything until you talk to someone
OOS group-piston pin now
OOS yep
OOS it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
OOS I'm not sure how this works tbh haha
OOS have you considered using 75?
OOS Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
OOS nice work!
OOS from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
OOS can you try to reduce tf at all
OOS Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
OOS yes
OOS that's not good. why did you tell me to increase the diameter?
OOS Have you changed bore diameter at all?
OOS ready?
OOS it got worse so i would change it back
OOS O|X|X
OOS ok
OOS The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
OOS time is up i believe
OOS ok
OOS good work
OOS your part seems pretty light how large can you make the FOS
OOS for my part or the whole thing?
OOS Changing D from 40 to 70 lowers the FOS drastically like ~ 3.0 but lowers the mass just a bit like ~ 0.1kg
OOS Thanks
OOS what mass do you have for the flywheel?
OOS 3.03
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it
OOS ?
OOS sorry, dc\
OOS Sweet we're at excellent quality rn
OOS ill try
OOS Sounds good
OOS My bad that wasn't clear, I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high FOS to begin with
OOS Can you change ds to 55 and braodcast
OOS idk i didnt change
OOS what is your mass?
OOS what is your mass and fos?
OOS yes
OOS from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS ok
OOS maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
OOS i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
OOS Hi what is the mass that you are currently using?
OOS Ok great
OOS We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
OOS what is the range of masses you can select?
OOS :)
OOS i dropped 1 kg with 3 fos
OOS ok it went up to 300 rn
OOS not me
OOS all good
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS mainly because mass
OOS ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
OOS mass?
OOS okay perfect
OOS basically c = 85  and dc =15
OOS weight is an output for me. The lowest weight I can get with a passable factor of safety at the current bore is 0.53
OOS did u try everyone else? cause our mass is too high
OOS Group: alert everyone before you change anything!\
OOS mine is 2.47
OOS sounds good
OOS Not with the current piston parameters. I'll see if he can change things so I can get a FOS back over 3
OOS In my simulation I increased Tf to 51. It brought the fos down ever so slightly, but brought down the mass by 2 kg for some reason
OOS What is your current FOS?
OOS my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
OOS t_f = 12.0 and d_s = 60.0
OOS nobody touch anything haha
OOS Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
OOS no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio
OOS thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter
OOS hello
OOS My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help
OOS group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
OOS if someone can decrease their mass by .9
OOS Sorry, t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length.
OOS The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
OOS i gotchu
OOS it said very good but someone changed someting
OOS kg
OOS GROUP: keep communicating!
OOS ooooo it went down but so did FOS
OOS wait
OOS so for you design a lower c is better?  does dc affect yours at all?
OOS that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
OOS OK STOP
OOS What is your current bearing offset?
OOS its good now just mass to worry about
OOS hahah this is rough
OOS How's the design going? I think we got to an excellent rating already!
OOS who many rounds do we getr?
OOS sup
OOS currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
OOS I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length
OOS My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
OOS try increasing your fos without increasing mass too much
OOS thats the only reason i knew how to do hw prob3
OOS okay nice
OOS i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier
OOS I am a little confused. I though I knew what I was doing, but when I hit broadcast my numbers for the subsystem changed.
OOS we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
OOS Increase
OOS and fos
OOS do you have your fos as close to 2
OOS I have around 10
OOS im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
OOS i willl try decreasing dc
OOS yes!
OOS nothing actually
OOS whats your fos?
OOS 1.14
OOS yeah its fine i jsut want $17
OOS Piston diameter of 75
OOS 43 or lower for fos greater than 2
OOS 150
OOS my factor of safety is maximized at low c values
OOS okay, I'll try using that now
OOS Trying to figure out what's happening
OOS good?
OOS We've got a "Good" engine
OOS K, lowest I can make my weight with FOS>2 is 5.42 which is a big improvement
OOS Yes that is what I have input
OOS i can get my mass between 0.5 and 0.6, and still have a pretty high FOS
OOS Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
OOS Hi
OOS I cant get a response tho
OOS Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller? What about the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS are we content with very good?
OOS No
OOS I think you need to change your c value
OOS dont change!
OOS also i forgot fos is just the minimum value not an average
OOS 0.63 mass
OOS hey
OOS Lets not change anything and get that $20
OOS What can you change that increases your FOS?
OOS our mass seems to be going up, are you using the original values?
OOS yeah but that increase weight by .5 gram is that worth it for you
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS did you change your mass a lot just now
OOS I have my diameter set to 40, but that has likely changed since I last chacked
OOS everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
OOS Do you need me to change anything?
OOS I haven't changed my dimensions for awhile now, hope that helps
OOS i haven't updated
OOS I am staying at m 0.07 and fs 1.23
OOS go back to what you had bc we were at good
OOS only the crankshaft offset
OOS updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
OOS What's your mass?
OOS i'm trying to minimize weight while keeping fos around 2
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS what do you control and what do you need
OOS how
OOS no
OOS That would be my guess too.
OOS or global?
OOS no they remain the same
OOS i broadcasted my best
OOS It says currently broadcasting 42 on my end
OOS kmaybe not
OOS Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
OOS first day on the job or something?
OOS you too!
OOS whats your current FOS?
OOS i don't believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
OOS I think it's at 2 right now
OOS mass = 4, FoS = 2.4
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS do you need to know any flywheel variables?
OOS What is the mass of your components?
OOS Ok cool
OOS 90
OOS Do you need flywheel's thickness?
OOS i think you might have to increase it
OOS just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
OOS what's your fos ?
OOS how much weight can you reduce roughly
OOS while keeping the fos fixed
OOS 70
OOS i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
OOS ive been at the first broadcast for a while now
OOS we are in excellent!
OOS We need FOS to be around 1.5
OOS got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
OOS what do you need to increase it?
OOS I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
OOS okay i just put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
OOS How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
OOS Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
OOS We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
OOS The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
OOS Ok that's what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes
OOS I've been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing D, but I haven't gotten any response.
OOS Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
OOS we're at good
OOS I'll be on it
OOS we are 1.94 over mass rn
OOS What are your mass and FOS?
OOS But FOS is low
OOS So we can keep it low
OOS Did you make any change after it was at very good?
OOS what is your fos?
OOS what variable do you control?
OOS the mass of the piston is currently 2.23
OOS connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
OOS Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
OOS How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
OOS Yeah, that was weird haha
OOS *increaseing
OOS ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS on the projector
OOS we went from excellent to poor, rip
OOS same here, any small decrease in mass lowers FOS by a lot for me
OOS can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
OOS GOOD***
OOS heyy is there anyway you could reduce the weight slightly?
OOS do you need any of my variables?
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS I'm at 2.77 now, all my numbers are at their minimum 
OOS let me check
OOS hello
OOS did oyu change?
OOS _IXI_
OOS I'll ask them
OOS piston-pin?
OOS Are you still running with diameter of 40
OOS Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
OOS how much mass is your part?
OOS 1643.92?
OOS Great - let me know if you need anything from me
OOS I don't think you need anything from me, do you?
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS did it.  we need to drop mass more still
OOS its helpful to get the ball rolling
OOS okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
OOS which do you need
OOS (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
OOS if you change the diameter to 65
OOS Whats the max fos you can get? without adding too much weight
OOS OK
OOS Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
OOS what is your mas and fos?
OOS It only matters about our lowest one I believe
OOS hahaha
OOS Hi
OOS 200 for offset works better for me
OOS we have our fos up, try reducing the mass
OOS ds is 20
OOS for the last simulation it is 43
OOS Keep your FOS above 2
OOS hmm, anything I can do to help reduce your mass?
OOS Yeah still at 40 just made thickness smaller
OOS dont change!
OOS flywheel guy was that you
OOS can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera?
OOS yee it has been good working with you as well
OOS i did it
OOS What's your mass?
OOS Nope, I have held mine constant since i cant get better than mass: 1.61 and FOS: 1.35
OOS ya, and im at poor quality, are you as well?
OOS 80 worked good for me
OOS 12 for tf and 60 for ds, my foss shows it at 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
OOS nope!
OOS Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
OOS now we are at poor again...
OOS we got excellent
OOS what up
OOS lets gooo
OOS just changed it to 25 d and t is 10
OOS gotcha
OOS I just increased it by 2 mm and we are still slightly below our mass requirement
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS group: who wants to go next?
OOS Mine neither
OOS Cool, and that brings the piston-pin FOS to just under 2
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS I control Flywheel thickness and Flywheel shaft diameter. I need Crankshaft Bearing Offset
OOS hmmm okay
OOS We just hit very good
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS Global requirements top of page
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
OOS What's your FoS?
OOS Can you increase your diameter?
OOS what is your current ds
OOS dc is crank-pin diameter
OOS so i got an fos of 3.39 and mass of 0.11
OOS what I'm looking at is 60 and 12
OOS Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
OOS k
OOS looks like we're done?
OOS I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts. I dont need them, fos = 0.71 now
OOS Where is the "change variables of other subsystems" button that it talks about in the handout?
OOS yes
OOS Hello my friend
OOS Yes
OOS D = 90
OOS havent found a combination better than .06 and 2.62
OOS did you get FOS as 1.81?
OOS before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
OOS yea sure
OOS Ok updated broadcast, now we're close
OOS What's your FOS?
OOS How does the bearing support offset affect your part?
OOS We only need above 2, so try as must as you can to lower the mass
OOS fake
OOS is diameter 90
OOS (To all): ok with results
OOS also reducing c significantly reduces the FOS
OOS Ok 60 is my lowest possible so I'll leave it at that
OOS ok got it
OOS i wouldnt up your weight
OOS the new design looks real good
OOS sounds good
OOS nobofy left the room did they?
OOS doesnt have to be ;)
OOS what is your FOS now?
OOS yes, as high as we can get FOS the better
OOS Maybe ask around
OOS Do you have control over D?
OOS we are at very good again as of 12;53
OOS lmk what you think
OOS 3.21
OOS what bore diameter are you using?
OOS I do not
OOS I'm at Mass 0.69 and FOS 3.84. We need to find some more weight to up your FOS
OOS Ok, I'm talking to the crankshaft guy to figure out how it affects his FOS because he is the one with the lowest FOS right now
OOS what is your fos?
OOS I'm about to drop the fos and mass because rod designer said it might help them
OOS Someone picked an FS of 0.51
OOS Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
OOS the crankshafts mass is really high
OOS What's your fos?
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS nah
OOS How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
OOS mass?
OOS Currently I'm at 7.69
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS on my screen it says your limit is between 150 and 300?
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS I don't know if I can get a FOS over 1 with that diameter
OOS hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod. my variables are l1 (length of the pin), and the inner and outer diameter of the pin (di, d0)
OOS do you have offset value?
OOS We are good, he said his FOS went up when I changed it down to 45
OOS why?
OOS Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
OOS TRUE
OOS looks like we're good
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS hah punnnnnnny
OOS 4000
OOS Diameter and thickness
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS cool we are good
OOS Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
OOS t = 8
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS Oh I've got a different system FOS, mine is about 2
OOS Awesome, thank you. Are you in control of that diameter?
OOS Do you have control over D?
OOS Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
OOS ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed
OOS Should have gone through? C= 150, dc=50
OOS hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
OOS ok
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS decrease mass
OOS sweet
OOS Our FOS just dropped a ton
OOS ranges
OOS interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
OOS I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and fos
OOS We need to decrease mass a lot
OOS Do what you need to do to get FoS > 1.5 and then we can adjust masses from there
OOS 3.91
OOS Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out, it seems really large
OOS I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
OOS Ohhh truee didn't think about that. Hmmm
OOS And the mass?
OOS i havent changed
OOS (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
OOS sorry I was distracted by other teammates\
OOS 1.92
OOS unless it drastically changes the mass
OOS That is my current max FOS. It can change some based on what piston diameter I have
OOS what mass are you working with?
OOS I have not decided yet. What would help you most?
OOS need: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
OOS cause i havent been changing my stuff and its fluctuating
OOS yeah
OOS its the flywheel guy
OOS That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
OOS Made diameter 75
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS make it higher
OOS ok i increased dc and it got better?
OOS Yeah one sec
OOS Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot.
OOS ok mine are c and dc will look into those
OOS Oh yeah okay.
OOS yeah im pretty confident mine is not gonna work
OOS *he or she
OOS mine is a diameter and i think it relates to piston
OOS but we can try to imporve
OOS for subsytsem
OOS input shaft wheel diameter
OOS The piston has a diameter of 75
OOS did you get your mass down?
OOS PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
OOS increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
OOS do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight?
OOS if I increase the offset, mass increases
OOS is it each part or globally
OOS im guessing flywheel
OOS what ranges of mass do you have for your part?
OOS yeah that is what im using
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS it's 5625 but my part has a weird fos
OOS what is your fos? can you reduce your mass at all while staying above fos=2.1
OOS Oh I did not receive that update, I'll try my numbers at 40 
OOS Great - thanks
OOS oof
OOS Ok
OOS our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad
OOS It just changed back to good
OOS do you need my thickness to increase?
OOS No, my FOS values are all greater than 300.
OOS how's your FOS looking
OOS like my FS just went from 1.9 to 2.2 without me changin anything for my part
OOS dont change it theyre changing it back
OOS use 43mm shaft diameter. The crankshaft engineer gave me that value recently
OOS please do
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS i waaaaaant mooooney
OOS check
OOS ms:1.17 fs:2.0
OOS what's your fos?
OOS interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
OOS ok will try some other variations
OOS yep
OOS need: piston bore diamter
OOS Nope
OOS If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
OOS I let the mknow
OOS i can get higher fos with relatively low m so maybe we can leverage this
OOS Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS what happened to our FOS oh geez
OOS SAme
OOS q4: did we talk about it in our classes this semester?
OOS my objective is to maximize it
OOS and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS whats your current FOS ?
OOS nah
OOS not sure whose is 1.79
OOS D= 47.4 or 40 for me
OOS and we need all the help we can get with fs
OOS we have our fos up, try reducing the amss
OOS for both fos and mass?
OOS Noted
OOS ok thats not me then. maybe ask around
OOS crank is 30 lbs alone
OOS Is your FOS twelve hundred??!
OOS mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
OOS Yea, nvm we're good i think
OOS same
OOS tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
OOS flywheel changed a value and i lost 5 lbs!
OOS okay!
OOS I think the other designers have way too high fos's
OOS Alright, I will try to figure that out
OOS ?
OOS do you control piston bore diameter?
OOS Don't think so
OOS No, because I haven't needed to. I'm mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now.
OOS I do not believe so
OOS Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
OOS the values range as other engineers alter their broadcasted values
OOS nevermind, back at excellent now.
OOS 60 mm
OOS and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS its 4821.91
OOS ?
OOS mine is 1.48
OOS if i make the piston diameter smaller, my FOS goes up
OOS sorry yes, 90 mm for bore D, I control the r values
OOS Yep, values finalized
OOS So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
OOS It does, if one of the engineers changes their dimensions mine are forced to change
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there?
OOS fos = 2.36
OOS thanks
OOS dont change!
OOS i kinda wanna know who the other people are
OOS from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
OOS my time is up
OOS I see it
OOS are you conerned with dimension dc?
OOS 5625
OOS mass 27.44
OOS and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS c:150 dc:50
OOS ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve fos some with other parts
OOS I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
OOS I hit up the piston but they never got back to me
OOS Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
OOS Ok with the minimum mass, for the flywheel, Fs is still 1215
OOS large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
OOS Is there any way you can reduce D?
OOS yeah it's a lot heavier
OOS my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
OOS I can minimize my diameter
OOS No
OOS how did the mass increase by this much
OOS 82.5, that is the second lowest for me
OOS what is your mass currently?
OOS yes
OOS I have not changed mine
OOS We did
OOS Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
OOS 1.48, my mass is so small im just trying to increase my fos
OOS How about you?
OOS how about increasing fos?
OOS we got it!
OOS If the piston diameter is 75, I can get a good mix of mass and fs
OOS (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
OOS I can try
OOS what is your current mass and fos?
OOS and also maximizing all the other variables I need
OOS at 47.5 or 55?
OOS ok \
OOS We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
OOS i think that will raise my FOS and lower weight
OOS ok make sure your fos is never below 2
OOS I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77
OOS Nevermind we getting there!
OOS It's not me
OOS sounds good but do you have any more room to reduce mass? I'm about the smallest I can make my parts
OOS will do
OOS group-save current values as backup 2
OOS No I do not, I would consult the piston
OOS Keeping it 45!
OOS yeah
OOS doing that now
OOS whats your fos? mine is 2.09, piston is 2.09 as well
OOS Hi
OOS changed piston back to 40 mm
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
OOS what's your max mass?
OOS ok
OOS we already had it once
OOS okay, so you part and my part are the heaviest
OOS Do you know why the mass is so high?
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS ...
OOS hahaha
OOS q3: does it hav emoving parts
OOS Not sure yet.
OOS do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
OOS lets not change anything and get that $20
OOS its huge its 15886
OOS Hows it looking now
OOS nice
OOS The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
OOS What are your current parameters?
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS Would a larger bore work better for you? I could go to about 45 but beyond that, my FOS goes below 1.7. My FOS is currently at 3.44 with a bore of 40
OOS undo what you did
OOS Do you know whats up
OOS I'm trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the fos while minimizing its mass
OOS i made my connector rod to crank length ratio 4
OOS 2.31
OOS agreed
OOS Yes
OOS ok your numbers seem ok idk where this low fos came from it was just good]
OOS lmk what you think
OOS For the diameter it is 25 right now
OOS Every 10 D I decrease from 70, mass decrease like 0.2-0.3
OOS what is your flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS 3.42
OOS yeah thats ok the fos for othee's will be less
OOS dc is the weight variable for me
OOS Anything changing when you change your numbers now?
OOS smaller gives me a much better fos
OOS *anyone has lower FOS change when mass dec?
OOS Agreed
OOS try to get the mass down below 40
OOS I dont no
OOS do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
OOS ok let me know if you want to change something
OOS BTW, shaved my mass down a tad. m = 0.52 now
OOS I don't have control over any diameters
OOS some one got good quality what where your variables in that
OOS At max FOS
OOS Okay sounds good
OOS group - same with piston-pin
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS yep trying my best now - we need to meet at least one of the criteria
OOS it is the smallest it can be
OOS yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
OOS oh right
OOS It just updated
OOS what's your mass ?
OOS Same for me my fos drops waaaay down and shaves only 0.12 from m
OOS Thanks
OOS What are your design variables currently?
OOS I don't have control over that. I believe that's the piston.
OOS Literally, there is not
OOS hello
OOS i have set it to those values
OOS Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
OOS m=0.07 FOS=1.23
OOS yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back
OOS My mass is 1.12, Fos is 4707
OOS We need to save weight.
OOS My simulation would be excellent, the broadcast was very good and now poor?
OOS keep fos around 2 never below
OOS bearing is 150, pin is 50 mm
OOS Currently is 21.49 for me, FoS is 1.74
OOS yes
OOS well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
OOS ok nvm
OOS my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
OOS hello
OOS We're close, guys
OOS ?
OOS alright yeah, I'm at lowest possible mass (0.1) and fos is 2.77
OOS my mass is minimized
OOS definitely
OOS make sure you update the global broadcast
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS can you try using 50 mm? and try to maximize the fos?
OOS no i dont have control of it
OOS try 40?
OOS i thought we are done?
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS 3.62
OOS Don't change anything
OOS Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
OOS The length of the crankshaft
OOS ok
OOS group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
OOS I think this is a trap
OOS *same
OOS Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
OOS whats the d and t values you
OOS maximize FOS
OOS against one of the walls
OOS my FOS is the lowest at 2.03, so you can probably make it even smaller if possible
OOS 1215
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS 17.5 would be great, lowers mass a ton
OOS I had it at m = 0.04 and f = 0.74 when the status of the engine was good
OOS let me check
OOS Is either tf or ds a variable of other subsystems for you?
OOS My dimension?
OOS lowest *
OOS our global FS just the lowest part FS you think
OOS yeah, working on it
OOS What are your ranges?
OOS Did you change anything?
OOS we are at very good
OOS what have you been in control of?
OOS re using now?
OOS yeah for sure him
OOS are you changing things
OOS D = 75
OOS ok
OOS group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
OOS U mean 0.672?
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS great
OOS Im still at poor quality... are you as well?
OOS one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
OOS the bearing support offset?
OOS that's cool
OOS ok let me see how that effects my design
OOS make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
OOS okay
OOS and t_h is 2
OOS I updated
OOS i updated another design
OOS Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod
OOS doth D and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass
OOS i was at t=10 and d=15 or 20
OOS what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
OOS looking at that now
OOS (piston head)
OOS what is your fs
OOS no only D
OOS Just changed it and it didn't help much
OOS okay that seems good
OOS FS?
OOS Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
OOS what is your mass currently?
OOS trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
OOS TA is saying time is up
OOS No, you?
OOS yea
OOS the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
OOS Piston Bore I am currently working with is 55mm
OOS but then
OOS okay, the bearing support offset should be minimized for my part and an increasing crank pin diameter increases my FOS
OOS I can increase my mass toi 0.75 and my Fos to 24.38
OOS alright, guess no then
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS Ok I can do that
OOS Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
OOS Looks like moving from 90 up to 105 doesn't benefit me much in terms of the FoS/mass ratio
OOS what value are you using because my design is dependant on that value
OOS yeah agreed, it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect, so im going to stick to maximizing FOS
OOS okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
OOS i meant for your individual part
OOS wassup
OOS The bore diameter?
OOS oh okay my handout said piston pin diameter should be displayed but isnt
OOS hi
OOS Same
OOS no
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
OOS Hello
OOS oops sorry for the repeat
OOS Who changed it
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS no
OOS sounds good
OOS yeah that makes sense
OOS just as a reference
OOS okay sounds good
OOS my design is basically fixed, i found a good design that have decent fos but not too heavy
OOS sweet, ill update my FOS
OOS c = 85 dc = 15
OOS lets just try getting our mass down
OOS lol
OOS my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter
OOS no I don't need either
OOS What is your range of fos?
OOS hmm i reverted to previous dimensions
OOS no
OOS Hello! what's the piston bore diameter?
OOS Is higher or lower D better for you?
OOS nice
OOS Could yo uoptimize your fos? I think your weight is mainly negligible
OOS Deciding on dimensions of a piston-pin
OOS The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
OOS do you need my rod cross section to increase?
OOS what c value do you currently have?
OOS crankshaft bearing offset
OOS yes
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS Yes, that's the minimum diameter I can use
OOS *person's
OOS See if you can bump that up
OOS 1.64
OOS let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS i think i will reach my  ideal values in a second
OOS just did
OOS ok. I have heard nothing from Crank Design
OOS we can
OOS Hi, please keep me updated on the piston bore diameter
OOS I still see 40
OOS Try to lower it to 2
OOS OK STOP
OOS perfect
OOS its at very good
OOS for c = 85 dc = 15 ds = 25 tf= 30 D = 70 fos = 2.37
OOS Tell me the tradeoffs
OOS 55mm
OOS Whichever works best for you
OOS ya we can always change it too
OOS oh wait, it might be the connecting rod
OOS it seems so, yet we are still over the mass limit?
OOS 3.05
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS D = 75
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS yeah that is what i am thinking as well
OOS to simulate
OOS you need to broadcast your simulation results. after simulating, you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS Ok. I will make adjustments
OOS 24.3 at m = .75
OOS mostly in flywheel design, I'm updating my values to see how those work
OOS That's literally the lowest value i have that's above 2 though
OOS ok guys looks good
OOS check with the others
OOS *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
OOS 1.29
OOS whats your FS
OOS 80,150,12,60
OOS I think my pin is what connects the crankshaft connecting rod to the piston
OOS m=4.28 fos=3.05
OOS global is at 2.3 right now
OOS which part of the piston are you handling?
OOS oh I see
OOS hows it going
OOS The piston can be any value between 3 and 15kg
OOS Check the top of the second page of the handout
OOS Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
OOS dont move
OOS I got good results with 55, but trying to bring down the mass
OOS Great
OOS piston bore diameter
OOS I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length. All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety
OOS Where is your FOS at?
OOS try that
OOS go with 90
OOS What is your range for diameter?
OOS thats the most central point in my simulation
OOS changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS 1.3 and mass is too high
OOS th, D, m, fos
OOS Di the numbers change for you?
OOS I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
OOS But I have the minimum fos so I'll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
OOS 22.4 and 1.5
OOS what are your input params besides the bore diam?
OOS Yeah really
OOS let me know what you think crank bearing offset (c) will be
OOS Nope
OOS cool
OOS bad ok dont do that
OOS Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
OOS hot dog
OOS I haven't touched any
OOS thats getting better, Im working w the piston to find the best D and will let you konw when we do
OOS nope mine has been at 1.27
OOS hmm...
OOS go for the lower Ms that has an FS above 2
OOS REFRESH IT, ITS LOWER THAN 2 RIGHT NOW
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS I used 40 mm which is the minimum value I can use
OOS I am thanks for letting me know!
OOS Can you increase mass slightly?
OOS The crankshaft takes up the most amount in terms of mass but is it possible to lower the value any further than 2.43?
OOS What is your range for D?
OOS ok guys looks good
OOS not me
OOS gave me dimensions earlier
OOS what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS is*
OOS I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs > 2 design.
OOS Ok
OOS what is your current mass and fos/
OOS try 65
OOS So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea
OOS lowest I could do is 75 for the weight
OOS make sure to broadcast variables
OOS someone changed thier mass
OOS we're at good lets leave it
OOS Our dimensions line up at least
OOS connecting rod said their mass is 0.11
OOS yes so run it with those values a
OOS okay. Have you talked to the other subsystems about only changing one subsytem at a time?
OOS I have D at 40
OOS I think that doing that effects the other designs as well
OOS Ok we're doing well. We're at good s
OOS oh okay, sounds good
OOS decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety
OOS Yep
OOS and i have leeway with my factor of safety
OOS how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
OOS it is best for me
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS did you make a change?
OOS Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS I'm the low FOS of 2.01, can you cut any more mass out
OOS I'm guessing the crankshaft. the piston is .55 and the piston pin is 0.06
OOS what variables do you depend on?
OOS make sure to broadcast
OOS i didnt change
OOS PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
OOS piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
OOS Hey so what changes have you made so far to the piston design?
OOS very close now
OOS my part doesnt effect mass very much
OOS See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
OOS Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
OOS what variables do you use?
OOS for your ouputs only?
OOS Ok
OOS Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
OOS and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
OOS nope
OOS yes, piston bore is 80
OOS I'll try again with new parameters
OOS I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
OOS Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
OOS the minimum it gives me is 150
OOS its 2700
OOS and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS *of mass
OOS What could i do to help your fos go up?
OOS Its excellent now
OOS Who is the fly wheel designer ?
OOS you change let me lose 5 lbs! Thanks fellow engineer!!!
OOS What is your FS
OOS I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
OOS I did and piston should be low now. rod is only a mass of .14
OOS look at the chart on the last page of your booklet, we are shooting for the highest FOS and lowest mass
OOS awesome! go team
OOS what does thatdo?
OOS Okay try and change C
OOS but it's better
OOS I will change to 70
OOS What's your mass rn?
OOS Hello! can you send me the ds and tf value>
OOS increasing c increases mass
OOS yes, let's do one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS trying to max fos and min weight
OOS grp-im done
OOS i control Ti and r1
OOS what are your weight and fos values
OOS 11.11
OOS Hi! what the values you are using?
OOS yeah, I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can
OOS i have one more setting before im at my lowest
OOS If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit
OOS I haven't touched anything for a while
OOS what bore diameter are you using?
OOS mass is lowest it can be with FOS larger than 2, I'll try more decimals
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS >:(((((((((((
OOS Hello
OOS did it.  need to drop more mass
OOS ok
OOS No
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS what is your bearing offset ?
OOS Okay, then you can do what you need to increase the FOS, then let me know the new D
OOS How is the factor of safety
OOS like one part has huge FS so they just minimized mass bc the part has FS over 100 no matter what option they choose
OOS no problem
OOS with a ratio of 4
OOS Its probably weighted. If we can raise the lowest fos to its max and the highest fos to its min mass it might work
OOS I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it?
OOS We've got a Good FoS now, just need to get mass down
OOS hello
OOS our mass just went up 20kg...
OOS good job team
OOS not that high
OOS I think hes at fos 1.64 and mass of 2,26 but that was a while ago
OOS decrease mass
OOS reply when done
OOS So we are in good range right now
OOS it's just good
OOS We're still seeing 80 as the globally broadcast value. Weird.
OOS no keep it low
OOS so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS WE are GOOD
OOS What factors are you interested in?
OOS What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
OOS what is your fos?
OOS Because they asked me for that
OOS i  have fos at 3.23
OOS Just did max, 105!
OOS sweet we're at excellent
OOS Do you need either of those?
OOS diameter D has been at 40 whole time
OOS because mine still read as excellent when my diameter was at 80
OOS idk what changed but quality just dropped
OOS 82.5 i was thinking, the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
OOS 150 mm
OOS got it, hmmm
OOS Hi, what is the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS m = 0.07 and fos = 1.59
OOS Hold where you are
OOS sure
OOS leave yours as is for now, piston is biggest factor rn
OOS mass = 11.09
OOS Same
OOS what diameter are you sitting at?
OOS yes
OOS Thanks.  If you need them, Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
OOS Im just trying to figure out how everything fits. We have to need to set certain parameters based on others
OOS Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
OOS I'm pretty sure I will leave the thickness at 10 mm
OOS Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
OOS good good. Lets keep it that way
OOS I don't think so, all I need is piston bore diameter
OOS You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his.her mass, crankshaft is the heaviest part
OOS u mean 80?
OOS Yeah. mass is still high though
OOS we were at 3.5 mass and 1.5 fos but now it is worse
OOS mass = 1.27 and f_os = 15886.04
OOS ?
OOS Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS yep i think so
OOS Does a large Flywheel mass help you?
OOS i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
OOS Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my value
OOS oh there we go
OOS I can choose diameter between 75 and 105
OOS yep...
OOS someone change thier mass
OOS Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
OOS if u want to adjust urs, u can announce to all chats
OOS piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
OOS he and i talked
OOS Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
OOS 75 mm
OOS We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
OOS ey ywe did it
OOS what mass are you getting?
OOS what is your crankshaft mass? And are you still using 70 for your crankshaft offset?
OOS By how much would be good for you?
OOS What did u choose for D?
OOS itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
OOS wait so I asked piston to lower his mass. So now my fos is lowered to 70, 
OOS i havent changed anything
OOS Wait, did you just change a value?
OOS it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
OOS Yeah I put my thickness and diameter to make ms=0.52
OOS did u get the light sensor working
OOS hiyo
OOS and one sec for the other one
OOS I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
OOS What parameters increaes your fos or mass?
OOS alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
OOS Are you there
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS Gotcha. We've got to get our FoS up to 1.5 if we're gonna get out of the poor category
OOS Do you have a value for piston bore diameter?
OOS more like first hour
OOS Yo
OOS ok ill leave it then
OOS now 1.46
OOS yeah if it lowers FOS too much, weshouldnt
OOS need: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS lmk what you think
OOS now its 4.92
OOS and how so?
OOS 40 mm
OOS Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
OOS we finished now?
OOS are you the conrod designer
OOS we got it, don't change things
OOS XI_IO
OOS idk how but our mass earlier was 33.29 or something
OOS minimized
OOS we need smaller mass
OOS yeah, what is it?
OOS My weight varies between 0.0 and 0.12 so im the wrong person to reduce weight
OOS 130
OOS tf = 12
OOS Mine are, but i have not made any drastic changes since. Your lowering of ds helped me shave off 2 more lbs
OOS We need an FS of 1.5
OOS we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
OOS nor crankshaft
OOS mine only goes up to 30 max
OOS wanna shoot for excellent? :P
OOS yep i got it
OOS What's your fos?
OOS what's your mass and fos when diameter of 70mm is used?
OOS yes. d from 20 to 15
OOS does increasing D give you better or worse weight
OOS Gotcha
OOS I think I've lowered it as much as possible without completely sacrificing FOS
OOS Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
OOS 2.77
OOS he won't respond to me
OOS we desperately need to reduce weight
OOS Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
OOS Hey, what fos, do you think would be good enough, 1.5-2.25 ish?
OOS Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
OOS i got barely any points on the third problem
OOS i will see what i can do
OOS need: crankshaft bearing offset
OOS alriight
OOS wait what
OOS also you can only see a few of the design variables, so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn't as good
OOS 60 ia the current value
OOS My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
OOS we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
OOS makes sense
OOS thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length
OOS Hello, is your FOS above 1.5?
OOS I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
OOS that puts my mass at 2.43 and fos at 3.9 with t=10, d=25, and c=70. That's not bad for now
OOS No idea
OOS I think flywheel is where our problems are
OOS Ok, is he working on fixing it?
OOS The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
OOS the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get fos to like 0.89
OOS does that work well for your subsystem?
OOS Lets decrease mass
OOS yes
OOS Oh, wow. My FoS is in the 20s, so I can definitely scale back
OOS What parameters can you change
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS Great - we're getting close.  I'm trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values
OOS Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
OOS ms was 2.79
OOS will do
OOS I think so
OOS i just reduced my mass
OOS group-flywheel now
OOS Whats your lowest mass?
OOS i have m = 0.07 and fos at 1.23
OOS I-section thickness and length of connecting rod.
OOS do you know what's going on?
OOS who changed
OOS I can increase the FOS, but it almost isn't worth it with how much weight is added on
OOS and increase FOS a decent amount
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS any updates?
OOS Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
OOS check for broadcast?
OOS ok no one anything
OOS what values are you using for the flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel
OOS so thats nice
OOS am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
OOS I don't select any diameter
OOS Did you make that change?
OOS ?
OOS Connecting rod says they are at FOS = 2.77
OOS group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
OOS our mass just went up 20kg...
OOS I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
OOS are we content with very good?
OOS for sure. go for it
OOS i will compile
OOS let me know if you need anything from me
OOS now we are at very good
OOS can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
OOS piston pin and flywheel are a little quiet and might not be interacting
OOS Are you changing youre values?
OOS what values are you suggesting?
OOS end*
OOS Cool
OOS hello?
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS wait your ds is 15 now?
OOS No at most ill change it by 10, how much would a diameter of 50 affect your mass and FOS
OOS I didn;t change
OOS Only the lowest matters, so there's no need for anything above 2
OOS I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS where are you getting that info
OOS whats your current FOS ?
OOS Our factor of safety is greater than 2, which is excellent 
OOS thats great, im at 0.1,2.62
OOS yes
OOS to give the same factor of saftey and reduced weight
OOS group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
OOS right :(
OOS *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
OOS Would it be possible for you to increase your fos?
OOS the highest fos rn for me is 0.89
OOS whyd we get bumped down
OOS That effects me as well
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS holy cow someone is making major changes
OOS okay, so let's try to get a high FS, as flywheel has huge masses, and they well work on mass reduction
OOS I have FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
OOS we need to work on making the design much lighter though if thats possible with your part
OOS I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
OOS looks like mass dropped a lot
OOS are the other people responding
OOS its bleow 40 and above 2
OOS i agree haha
OOS hahahahaa
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS no idea
OOS It's down to 3.22 with the current bore diameter
OOS piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
OOS update:
OOS higher tf is better for me
OOS yeah I think since the piston pin weighs so little, what you have is good
OOS We're a little above the mass but otherwise good
OOS what ur fos
OOS wow english
OOS nope, haven't broadcasted in a bit. The most I can change the wieght is by like 3 anyways
OOS X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
OOS me too
OOS End experiment, nice worK!
OOS Ok. I decreased my weight a little bit
OOS hmm
OOS oh okay
OOS Piston diameter and piston head thickness
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS diamater is 90
OOS group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
OOS ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
OOS aight did you broadcast anything?
OOS object? i dont know the options for categories lol
OOS For lower mass I could make it 40, it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn't affect FOS as much
OOS and what are your numbers when you do that
OOS thickness 12 diameter 60
OOS someones FOS is too low
OOS ok
OOS piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
OOS crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
OOS Same.
OOS the piston wont respond
OOS c is bearing support offset
OOS I'm gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
OOS no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
OOS i think ive optimized my part
OOS 1.36
OOS Ok, try reducing the diameter to 45 and see what happens
OOS thinking about changing it to 55
OOS Interesting, the mass is what is hurting us but the FOS is beautifull
OOS Hey could I get the value of the piston bore diameter whenever you've got it?
OOS We're done
OOS I know.
OOS I've just been clicking refresh for the last 20 minutes haha
OOS Are you currently changing values?
OOS now its 1.67
OOS Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
OOS back at 80
OOS do you control ds?
OOS gg team
OOS Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
OOS i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
OOS yes
OOS let me know if you need to go any lower
OOS currently 1.64
OOS ya I need the piston to change the bore diameter so I can see how if effects my numbers
OOS how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
OOS Good point, 40 is the lower limit
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is.  we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS group-save current values as backup 2
OOS okay
OOS current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS message back when you did it
OOS make sure to broadcast variables
OOS 55
OOS yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
OOS Alright.
OOS back at80
OOS Do you need any info from me?
OOS Hey what do you have control over?
OOS f_os = 9193.31
OOS right now its 0.1 but it ranges from 0.01 to 0.1
OOS thanks
OOS My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
OOS whats your mass
OOS 7.98
OOS or we were for a second
OOS I would double my system weight though.
OOS Way to be on top of things, I won't vote you off the island
OOS trying to lower mass of 2.43, still using 70
OOS Our fos just dropped again
OOS whats your weight at?
OOS whats your fos ?
OOS what is the mass of your design?
OOS good working with ya
OOS ?
OOS Make sure your part's FOS isnt the same as the sub system's. If it is, increase it slightly
OOS I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually. So we cannot optimize that part.
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department.  Let's reduce mass.
OOS diameter is 25 mm
OOS Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
OOS its already over 2
OOS awesome. have you noticed that based on the chart we should be in excellent with our current values?
OOS what are your ds and tf?
OOS gotcha
OOS alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
OOS kk
OOS does your design depend on the flywheel at all?
OOS some one got good quality what where your variables in that
OOS i have 1.7 fos with 58 mass
OOS If you need to increase up to 42 thats possible
OOS what diameter should i use. i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of 97.5
OOS 0.13
OOS 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
OOS Are you in charge of determining the piston bore diameter?
OOS perfect
OOS nope
OOS What's your system mass and FOS?
OOS piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
OOS Do you have piston bore diameter?(D)
OOS our weight is the high bit
OOS Im going to reduce piston D to 75to see what happens
OOS they were the minimum of both
OOS sweet
OOS What did you choose your diameter to be?
OOS Have you changed the diameter at all?
OOS update back to very good
OOS i only depend on the piston
OOS I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
OOS can get 2.62 fos with .01 extra mass
OOS my mass is 1.27 already
OOS or crankshaft
OOS how much mass is your part?
OOS Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
OOS I don't think so, maybe try to find an fos closer to 2 and reduce the mass?
OOS what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
OOS your FOS is in the thousands????
OOS Ah okay, gotcha
OOS tractor king
OOS I dont think those effect my design. Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else
OOS Ok
OOS nice
OOS Hello piston, based on my information, it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness (tf) and maximize flywheel shaft diameter (ds). Does this work with your design requirements?
OOS Sweet!
OOS Yeah I'm talking to the crankshaft
OOS Minimize mass of connecting rod and maximize factor of safety against yielding due to buckling.
OOS who went down in weight?
OOS I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
OOS Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
OOS we havent added it yet
OOS okay
OOS also decreases my fos
OOS mass went up quite a bit on my end
OOS yup just got that, asked piston to lower his mass. Just to see
OOS Ok, someone changed something and made it much worse
OOS ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
OOS im not sure if everyone is on board.
OOS piston controls it
OOS yeah the pin is pretty light, shouldnt be an issue
OOS Didn't change anything. We need to decrease mass
OOS yea lets not change any more variables
OOS nice work!
OOS no I dont
OOS the final isnt cumulative tho
OOS Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already?
OOS kk ill test
OOS Supposedly increasing the offset increases m and decreases f, so lose-lose for me
OOS Lets not change it now
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS communication is key my brotha
OOS great, done then
OOS Alright, thank you. That is the highest FOS I have found
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS Do you need to know what the thickness of I-section or Conrod length is because I am in charge of choosing those variables?
OOS what is the bore diameter?
OOS Ok
OOS the new one is 45 as of now
OOS Mine's still 2.95
OOS Our FOS dipped again
OOS Who changed it
OOS group: who's next?
OOS what values do you have control over?
OOS whats your current FOS
OOS im not sure yet
OOS Thank you
OOS increase in either variable causes both the mass and FOS to go up
OOS My piston mass is 0.52 and FOS is 2.01
OOS What's the FOS of your current selection? I'm trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over FOS
OOS I'm at lowest mass for 55 bore diameter. I can step down to 47.5 bore diameter and that might help
OOS mine says Very Good
OOS I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
OOS 2.01
OOS me too
OOS It still says .51 and he said that was for the team and that I couldn't see my own. I don't know if that makes sense though??
OOS flywheel
OOS With my current design, mass is 0.52 and Fs is 2.0
OOS Its the lowest mass with an FOS above 2
OOS Try for a FOS of 2 with minimum mass
OOS X|X|O
OOS at this point, just piston diameter
OOS My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
OOS we have our fos up, just need to reduce the mass
OOS so it looks like my max FOS is 1.23 with 47
OOS Sick, our engine is now excellent
OOS it costs money
OOS crankshaft offset
OOS Not yet
OOS mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
OOS then we can ask someone to decrease mass
OOS increase* sorry
OOS yeah it sucked
OOS no we need mass below 35
OOS crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
OOS I mean something changed and made it go back down to very good, but I didn't change anything, did you?
OOS and D = 85
OOS we can both move. i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it
OOS my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
OOS my current c i 150 and dc of 30
OOS at bore diameter of 40
OOS And also the fos?
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS what fos #s are you getting?
OOS 100 as initial experiment
OOS mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
OOS and thickness
OOS *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
OOS A bit. I can lower bore diameter
OOS *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
OOS the closest FOS I have above 2 is 3.78. I'll try broadcasting it
OOS maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
OOS yeah, I see the change now
OOS good?
OOS Alright, thank you!
OOS nevermind just updated broadcast
OOS pretty sure no one
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS What is your mass?
OOS why isnt this exxcellent
OOS The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass
OOS any changes?
OOS FOS 2.06
OOS I just got my FOS up to 9
OOS ok i did
OOS How are we looking with FS?
OOS Mine is at 2.36
OOS i updated
OOS What are you working on?
OOS m_s : 1.46;   fos_s : 1.32;
OOS cool
OOS awesome
OOS 80 as the current design
OOS Did your values just change?
OOS What value would be ideal for the flywheel?
OOS sure
OOS right now
OOS 12 and 60
OOS Fos could increase with increase in mass but if it's already so high I don't think it matters, right?
OOS yeah right now i have a piston diameter of 90 and head thickness of 7.25
OOS Hey whats the Fs for your subsystem?
OOS I'm trying to find out what everyone's FS is. crankshafter has theirs at 3.62
OOS i did it.  Looks a little closer but not quite there
OOS ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
OOS 82.5 actually
OOS Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS 40 inches.
OOS updated my mass to 1.19
OOS Yeah I was about to ask that and i think you are right
OOS Weigght!
OOS actually
OOS these are the same values for the "very good" design
OOS Ok
OOS we are 1.94 over mass rn
OOS we need less mass folks
OOS yep
OOS the mass shot up
OOS .06 and 2.62
OOS whats your mass?
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
OOS if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
OOS did any mass values change?
OOS for my subsystem?
OOS nice. So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
OOS sounds good
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS also how much does bore diameter effect you? If i go down to the lowest bore diameter I can increase FOS a bit
OOS we're at excellent
OOS I'm not sure what happened, but if you need me to change anything, let me know. From here all I can do is increase FOS and mass, but we don't need that
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS who are you working with?
OOS what is your mass
OOS lower bore diameter? on it. I'll go down to 55 and see what we can get
OOS D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
OOS but were at v good
OOS Hello, I am currently trying to solve for the piston-pin length, and I need the piston bore diameter (D). Do you happen to have this value?
OOS Got it
OOS Im working on the connecting rod. Honestly just trying to figure out how to start
OOS What about you?
OOS We were at exceelent and now poor, did you change anything?
OOS no i do not. i am compiling everyones
OOS Lower D works better for both me and the rod designer, do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS No only the inner piston bore diameter
OOS so ds doesn't make a difference for my fos
OOS I can try and trim a little more tho]
OOS i need: piston bore diameter
OOS our weight is the high bit
OOS the broadcast still shows 40
OOS I double checked the handout and yeah, it's only dependent on lower FOS
OOS we need FOS up a bit more now overall
OOS also broadcast those, I am not using your variables others might
OOS I'll try
OOS piston is0.91
OOS and yes I'm broadcasting that
OOS no
OOS Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
OOS make sure you update the global broadcast
OOS No i think its fine i was just curious
OOS mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
OOS what FS are you broadcasting
OOS Right now I am at 90. Would you want me to increase or decrease that?
OOS yep
OOS 0.1
OOS My parameters are thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter. If you feel this directly applies to your design let me know!
OOS let's not change it
OOS Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
OOS ok dont do that
OOS Are you chnaging anything?
OOS ok
OOS We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
OOS _I_I_
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS I didn't, and neither did crankshaft. I think flywheel did
OOS I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the FS, I can make my part heavier
OOS Thanks
OOS Okay we are good now
OOS 3.2, but that's about to decrease since my mass is way too high
OOS I set t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4, and the quality turns out to be excellent
OOS So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably
OOS try changing your other values?
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS Can you broadcast a design with c as 130?
OOS yes
OOS what is your ms?
OOS indeed
OOS bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
OOS ans 0.63 mass
OOS _I_IO
OOS are you still using 40 for the diameter?
OOS the dream team
OOS Yeah they said they're not going to change it now
OOS hmm ok I'll check around
OOS Will experiment
OOS idk
OOS Do you need any information from me?
OOS yeah me too
OOS how much does the mass increase?
OOS got em
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS you have o maximise c right?
OOS yes
OOS yes, the minimum is 700 haha
OOS So we are in good range right now
OOS how about you?
OOS yeah 0.09 isnt hot
OOS group - same with piston-pin
OOS can you please share your variables with just the letters
OOS aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click "check for broadcast"
OOS and I have no variables controlled by others
OOS The value I'm at now is the lowest it can be without going below 1.5. As the crank lenght is changed, my values change though
OOS group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
OOS it was excelent, someone messed it up
OOS Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS what do you control!
OOS how are your masses and FS looking?
OOS great question, but it is all legitimate
OOS there
OOS Are they related? There is nothing in my design to indicate that they are
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
OOS I think we're .1 over now. Best options I have to increase FOS would also lead to lowering bore diameter. IDK how that effects you
OOS 40~70
OOS Can you lower your diameter a touch? My options depend only on that.
OOS "however D will need to increase to compensate for the reduced FOS"
OOS What factors are you interested in?
OOS what's your mass and FOS
OOS for fos
OOS :)
OOS fos went up to 2.22 and mass went up to 37.56 from 35. something
OOS bearing support offest
OOS 1.12
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS If that reduces your fos
OOS can we submit now?
OOS thats a double negative then right. Can you see the power components. I know we have to satisfy minimums for some specs
OOS i can go lower but it'ss reduce fos
OOS It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I'm doing something wrong
OOS The fos range for others is between 2.5 and 4.09
OOS no, i got my best value now
OOS The crankshaft designed is changing values
OOS I control D somewhere in 90
OOS i think this is a trap
OOS D = 80 not 90
OOS yo the far right column, should we just pick the one with the lowest ms and highest fos
OOS so all the values you get are assuming max piston bore diameter?
OOS Must be
OOS what is your fos rn?
OOS Okay
OOS i'm focusing on minimizing thickness primarily
OOS okay. I think the value is not this.
OOS piston is 0.83
OOS What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter?
OOS ok so id say you worry more about low mass with D and I can worry more about high FOS with ds
OOS we had "good" at one point didnt we?
OOS okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
OOS ta said we're good
OOS no my mass is 3.05 and my FOS is 2.02
OOS I think the rest of us are right around 2.0
OOS I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
OOS We need to decrease mass a lot
OOS agreed
OOS I will be using 40mm going forward
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS I can get mine up to 3.44 max where D = 40
OOS 51 and 1.1
OOS should we end?
OOS thickness is at lowest
OOS Did you change your broadcast?
OOS is there any way you can change your numbers to increase fos while keeping mass similar
OOS I'm seeing 1.75
OOS will do
OOS ok.
OOS Are you currently changing values?
OOS current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
OOS we only need it to be above 2
OOS even in the case by case basis, the higher the FOS the better
OOS hey try changing the diameter to 90
OOS and your mass?
OOS but imma find em
OOS What value are you using for your piston bore diameter?
OOS did you just change something?
OOS mine still says fair
OOS *we only need to decrease mass now
OOS I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the FS, I can make my part heavier
OOS fos went from 3.18 to 2.95 and mass from 0.13 to 0.11
OOS okay one sec
OOS Yeah I think that's the best we can get
OOS ill check
OOS Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
OOS We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
OOS Gotcha
OOS alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past 1.23 FOS
OOS ok sounds good
OOS changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
OOS okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
OOS Im sticking with that
OOS ok youre the minimum
OOS this is as good as i can get
OOS mine has been constant from last change
OOS quality just went down to poor for me. seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything?
OOS ya go ahead and change it back, can you lower D any more?
OOS thanks
OOS I have control over D
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS I think my d_c makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
OOS We at fair. Good enough?
OOS okay, you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger
OOS piston-pin is not responding
OOS What's your FOS given the crankshaft bearing offset that the crankshaft has?
OOS crankshaft has a mass of 28
OOS any suggestions?
OOS I'll prioritize on increasing FS
OOS what is the range of values you can choose?
OOS can we submit now?
OOS i drop to .97 FS
OOS i broadcasted my best
OOS Currently 3.2
OOS yeah thats weird
OOS ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
OOS are you still using D = 40?
OOS someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
OOS If I drop my weight way down though my fos is super trash
OOS hi
OOS i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS Wanna call it?
OOS do you think I should try and increase those?
OOS mass is currently 1.53 and FOS 2.01
OOS hey
OOS Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
OOS I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
OOS How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
OOS Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod?
OOS that's better than poor
OOS did you change anything?
OOS awesome job
OOS rad
OOS what's your factor of safety currently
OOS what are your current values for mass and fos?
OOS Around 2 would be ideal
OOS but that might change the system actually
OOS my FOS is best at 40, making it larger decreases my FOS
OOS We need to work on FS. Is it just an average of all the factor of safetys?
OOS you should probably ask him/her
OOS 1.23 is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter
OOS what shaft diameter are you using
OOS Aim for FOS to be above 2 while minimizing mass
OOS Well it's between 40 and 70 so maybe like 55 to start? I'll run some simulations
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
OOS the thickness(t_I) ranges from 5 to 15 mm, and ratio(r1) ranges from 5 to 5
OOS we finished now?
OOS cool. not touching anything
OOS Did
OOS FS is currently 1.23
OOS okay, stay at that point
OOS my foss is 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
OOS but we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
OOS I don't think so
OOS We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
OOS What is your current mass at?
OOS yo
OOS ok, i m gonna try different thckness of I section on the rod as well as the conrod length
OOS My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
OOS check out my latest broadcast, that looks like the best I can do
OOS What does your system FS value say? mine are all like over 4000 even when i minimize mass
OOS for c
OOS i changed the mass from 50 to 30
OOS No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
OOS so let's lower our weight first
OOS also what are your ds and tf values
OOS Yeah I noticed the same thing
OOS 2 is for expecially good design
OOS maybe we need to be secret
OOS What is your piston bore diameter?
OOS Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
OOS Okay, thank you
OOS I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
OOS I'm jumping between (0.7,0.7) and (0.7,0.8) for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass
OOS thickness = 8
OOS Right. Got mine to mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
OOS diameter is 90
OOS can you share all your variables
OOS Rod designer still here
OOS crankshaft hit the wrong button that is why i think it went back to poor
OOS We need FS to increase now
OOS let me know if you change it at all
OOS can you trim a tiny bit more?
OOS btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
OOS You could reduce the FOS value since they are looking for the component with the smallest FOS value
OOS we need mass down a bit
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS But I haven't changed anything and it went down.
OOS gg team
OOS can you reduce mass but keep FOS above 2?
OOS 1.8 to 4.72, I'm currently at 2.14 but can drop to 1.96 without loosing too much fos
OOS D = 90 for now
OOS my mass = 6. im guessing connecting rod?
OOS yo
OOS i think i changed it to excellent
OOS bets on who goes rogue
OOS alright
OOS lets play tic tac toe (give me a sec)
OOS what values are you using for the input poston bore diameter?
OOS yeah exactly
OOS 27.44
OOS try to decrease mass while keeping FOS over 2
OOS at the top it says round 2
OOS smallest
OOS but 90 is best for us
OOS yeahh idk where they r at
OOS 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
OOS sweet
OOS piston told me, crankshaft want him to have miximum diameter
OOS no, i mean 6.72
OOS I have, at least on my screen.
OOS These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different D: 75: 5.45, 85: 6.72, 95: 8.08, 105: 9.56. These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different diameters
OOS what is your piston bore diameter? 40?
OOS sweet we just need to get mass down
OOS no one depends on mine either
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS I think i have my ideal broadcast
OOS LOL NO
OOS I think it could be a little lower since a factor of safety above 2 is considered excellent
OOS ranges from0.45 to 4.43
OOS yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
OOS i used 40mm
OOS same
OOS We are good on mass
OOS excellent
OOS Good
OOS Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design.
OOS but you can't change that right?
OOS For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
OOS Is there a tf that works best for you?
OOS nice
OOS ok so if you increase C my fos goes down but weight is not effected
OOS thats good
OOS it doesnt impact it much, and my part is low mass so if i have to change it, that wont be a big deal
OOS 2.11. I can't really descrease is. my dimensions are at their max/min
OOS Ive changed it and I can sway the overall by roughly 0.1 by adding 0.03 mass
OOS it says very good
OOS c was changed to 80
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS Sounds good
OOS waaaaait my bad
OOS back at 80
OOS ms=0.52 fos=1215
OOS Currently I think the mass is too much.
OOS The crankshaft by far has the most mass
OOS I am doing that now. Thanks for the help!
OOS ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
OOS same
OOS everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
OOS We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
OOS Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
OOS still fos of over 1000
OOS You good to leave
OOS but no one changed anything i believe
OOS minimum mass that has FOS > 2
OOS We need to reduce mass if possible
OOS I just bumped mine up
OOS Do you know if theres a specific way all our parts work together? I can change mass and FS of my part but depending on like my offset do other parts need to be a certain dimension?
OOS what is your mass and fos when you maximize both your design variables
OOS current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
OOS yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
OOS *your
OOS It does not affect my part
OOS No i do not!
OOS We need just a hair less mass
OOS D, d_s, and t_f, but I don't know how to use those
OOS yes, 40
OOS Im sticking to a small mass bc right now we are heavier than allowed
OOS now the whole part is 3.86
OOS Our FOS was at like 2.5 and mass was at 44. Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton.
OOS whats the name of the diameter?
OOS try reducing C?
OOS what changed>
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS Are you broadcasting that?
OOS how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
OOS I think the 82.5 is the best. let me know when you are okay for me to change it back.
OOS the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS mass,fos
OOS alright, let me find my  ideal values based on the 40
OOS is that a typo?
OOS its too low to have the impact it is having
OOS X X O ; O O X ; X O O
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS rn i have a 90 mm diameter
OOS I just saved mass changing tf to 30
OOS have you changed the bore diameter?
OOS i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
OOS im using a 40
OOS ahh, its changed for me
OOS your variables affect the other measurements
OOS well the grade scale shows that a total mass below 2 should be possible
OOS I think tyhe 47.5 produced better results
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS what you need and what you have
OOS you too!
OOS or maybe 80
OOS Actually we're only at 2.84
OOS piston
OOS Would increasing or decreasing ds lower the weight?
OOS 0.11
OOS I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
OOS Yeah for a second we were meeting both...I wonder what just updated?
OOS Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin?
OOS My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
OOS and i think D
OOS i have been
OOS you could try increasing D a little and see what happens overall
OOS whats your mass at? and can it be lowered
OOS We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
OOS *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
OOS Can you do D =85?
OOS flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
OOS gg
OOS I'm not sure why they aren't updating though when I change my input values
OOS t = 5.7, r1 = 4
OOS sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter, connecting rod thickness, and connecting rod length ratio
OOS My fs is 2.27 and mass is 19.96
OOS Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
OOS Do we want to end with very good?
OOS 4.55 which is my highest
OOS hello?
OOS Sorry, what is your current length
OOS i havent changed anything
OOS yeahh i think thats what happened to most people
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS ok we are good
OOS I'm looking for the lowest mass with highest fos right now
OOS Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
OOS i increased the diameter to improve the factor of safety, I can reduce it if we want to try it out
OOS ok and which do you depend on
OOS me either
OOS yeah one sec
OOS 0.02-0.12
OOS Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass = 0.12 and FOS = 3.44
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS We're done
OOS I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
OOS 40 mm works fine for me. Fs of 4.71 and mass of 0.76. I will continue to iterate.
OOS I'd like to keep it at 47 since that help connecting rod
OOS were in good range rn
OOS it was 2.79 then made a couple changes and now it 1.25
OOS I can only do 60-130
OOS but ive decided im gonna focus more on 352 bc its a heavier weighted class
OOS hi
OOS down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
OOS Whats the best you can get with a bore diameter of 80?
OOS so are we just done then? lol
OOS whats your fos  ?
OOS Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
OOS My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
OOS just above 2
OOS I have found a piston bore diameter of around 90 to be best for me
OOS right now we need to focus on mass
OOS think low fos is from piston pin
OOS my bad, thanks 
OOS cool. I'll let everyone else know
OOS My mass is 0.87
OOS we can see how good his/her part is with 45 and increase if necessary
OOS The global variables are giving our current FOS is 0.57 so I think we need to maximize that
OOS Ok my fos is 2.03 with m - 0.05
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS 1.2
OOS i have mass 1.27, FOS: 15886
OOS is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
OOS Yeah we were at excellent but we've gone back down to poor now somehow
OOS okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
OOS I lowered the r values. It did lower the weight, but the FOS is too low now
OOS is there any way you can make our fos increase
OOS 44, 1.29
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS sorry left my caps on
OOS okay cool everyone responded
OOS we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
OOS Hello, Do you need any parameters from me? 
OOS ours just does donuts as of rn
OOS sorry 50 mm
OOS current mass is 0.01 with fos 0.1
OOS i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS do you depend on t1 or r1?
OOS goal weight is actually 35
OOS grp-im done
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
OOS no
OOS What are your settings now?
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS flywheel - update the group when you change!
OOS Mine range from 1.5 to 65.
OOS I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
OOS some one got good quality what where your variables in that
OOS yep
OOS whats dc
OOS Alright thanks
OOS 2.83
OOS Yeah, FOS hasn't been an issue for me, it's just mass is way too high
OOS Yes
OOS is it possible for that to go lower
OOS Thanks
OOS Lets try and get back to where Fair was, that seemed like the right track 
OOS or avg
OOS I think the lowest fos is what is broadcasted
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS I believe FOS of 2.31
OOS can you reduce is closer to 2 while decreasing mass?
OOS oh true
OOS and see
OOS good job team
OOS hows it going?
OOS Is there any information I could give you that could help your design?
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS awesome, i think this will help. Should I go to my lowest setting or no? Im on my second to lowest setting right now
OOS Im at 0.1 rn with a fos of 2.52
OOS Don't use a FOS of higher than like 5
OOS dont change anything
OOS I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality
OOS no way
OOS q5: is it a windshield wiper
OOS can you try the one thats closes to 2?
OOS though I might switch to 75
OOS same
OOS I have an fos of 1.45 now, I'll try increasing the diameter
OOS mass?
OOS Ok, I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
OOS what are the values you put
OOS GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
OOS ok thx
OOS At max FOS
OOS crankshaft is 1.93
OOS Our fos just dropped again
OOS Nope, mass = 1.27, fos_s=13238
OOS so let's lower our weight first
OOS ok I have mass: 3.05, FOS 2.02
OOS my weight is minimized completely fos = 1212
OOS go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS Fair!
OOS IT HAS US AT EXCELLENT NOW
OOS okay
OOS ?
OOS I see
OOS was it D=75 that was giving us that low weight?
OOS 1.62 kg
OOS group-piston pin now
OOS ggs
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS group: who's next?
OOS So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
OOS its up to 1.7 now so getting there
OOS Crankshaft bearing offset? I don't control that variable!
OOS what parameters do you have?
OOS Are you referring to  the piston bore diameter?
OOS 1.35 i mean
OOS what is the range for your mass values?
OOS that wasnt me
OOS 0.24
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
OOS so for flywheel reasonable mass and best FOS is giving thickness of 12
OOS Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by .15 while also increasing fos by .65
OOS Thats great, any way you can reduce weight more then?
OOS Do you need any dimensions from me?
OOS aight
OOS thanks!
OOS I don't think so
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS perfect
OOS I'm ending it
OOS Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness, piston bore diameter
OOS i am maxed out i think
OOS 150
OOS just kidding, back to poor. 
OOS No idea
OOS did it.  need to drop mass more
OOS broadcasting 2.85 with a mass of 1.36
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS we are at excellent now
OOS my mass is 3.57
OOS ok i get fos of 5 and ms of 7
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS I'm working with Piston to improve my FOS
OOS can you change yours? Piston and flywheel just changed theres
OOS 0.11
OOS I can decrease my mass by .19kg but that brings my FoS down 1.49
OOS Hello
OOS also piston guy is using D=40
OOS thats an L
OOS okay, what's your weight?
OOS wasnt me
OOS yeet
OOS 2.95 is my minimum, I can't go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
OOS alright, guess not then
OOS Not moving even a bit :')
OOS everyone else has remained the same values
OOS Makes sense, but when I improve mine the overall systems decreases.
OOS Okay
OOS nope
OOS i brought it down
OOS I changed fos but not the diamter
OOS does yours say that too?
OOS I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
OOS how much mass is your part?
OOS we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
OOS ok who will my t_h or piston head thickness affect?
OOS Not from what I understand
OOS 80mm
OOS r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
OOS The piston pin is pretty important though so id say maximize mass for fos if you can
OOS to 150
OOS Do you have an option of an FOS of at least 1?
OOS what fos are you broadcasting?
OOS ayyyyyy
OOS How's the effect of the diameter on mass?
OOS my connecting rod length = 1/(crank length)
OOS ah okk
OOS perfect
OOS Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
OOS No, I have two of my own variables
OOS no just leave it im fine with very good
OOS Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
OOS Hell to the yeah
OOS Awesome. Thanks
OOS whats the max diamter
OOS group-save current values as backup 12
OOS m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
OOS yeah
OOS my part maintains FOS=2.06
OOS Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
OOS lol
OOS I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
OOS Try and decrease C so that we increase the factor of safety
OOS Are we good to end?
OOS nah dont do that
OOS more mass
OOS mine is 0.1 so idk why our mass is so high
OOS Yea I believe so.
OOS ok that was what I was seeing as well
OOS im at 2.07
OOS Not for a little bit. did something change for you?
OOS ?
OOS Mine is at 4.55
OOS 27.44
OOS I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
OOS Nevermind
OOS did you change something after excellent
OOS Are you changing youre values?
OOS it needs to be just above 2
OOS Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
OOS I also have that dimension
OOS no worries
OOS D = 90
OOS The input crank-shaft bearing support offset
OOS 7.02
OOS I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the FOS
OOS can you change it to 150?
OOS Ok.
OOS i didnt move
OOS Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
OOS just kidding, back to poor. 
OOS What requirements do you have on the Piston bore diameter?
OOS if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an FOS of over 2 that chould do it
OOS rying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
OOS Is 75 still the number youre going with
OOS lets get this bread
OOS since if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
OOS I am at my lowest
OOS whats your fos?
OOS nah, I assume you're talking about the piston bore diameter right?
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS my mass is minimized rn
OOS as long as you dont dramatically decrease your Fs because i think most oif it is coming from you
OOS ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
