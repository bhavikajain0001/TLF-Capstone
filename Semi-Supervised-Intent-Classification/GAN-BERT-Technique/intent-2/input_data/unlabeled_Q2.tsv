UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK 150 is working pretty well for me right now
UNK_UNK 85 right now
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK What's the mass that you are using?
UNK_UNK Kind of, increasing thickness increases FOS
UNK_UNK okay im at max fos
UNK_UNK Nicole who dis?
UNK_UNK My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone  Send
UNK_UNK *back up 2
UNK_UNK FOS is 2.85
UNK_UNK whats your FOS if you dropped mass by 3kg
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK Do you know whose FOS is the lowest at the moment?
UNK_UNK so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK lol i think its flywheel haha
UNK_UNK ok!
UNK_UNK i think its just the number of times youve broadcasted?
UNK_UNK ok so your mass should be fine. not a big contributing factor
UNK_UNK can you share your equations?
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK I think that will be the crankshaft!
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
UNK_UNK Still 40mm. Will increasing bore help your design?
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK does that work well for you?
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK 2.77 is my minimum mass and fos I'm afraid
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more
UNK_UNK fos>2 and m<35
UNK_UNK Hello.  Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
UNK_UNK crankshaft a lil suspicious too
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK just 0.12
UNK_UNK it is at 150
UNK_UNK As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
UNK_UNK im trying to figure out who has the min FOS
UNK_UNK Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
UNK_UNK Ok let me know if you change that because it will effect my design
UNK_UNK Is there anything related to an increase/decrease in mass/fos on your end?
UNK_UNK man 0.09 fos lol
UNK_UNK for c?
UNK_UNK No. You have the lowest FOS at 1.92 currently
UNK_UNK try to increase your FS
UNK_UNK sorry hit the wrong button fixed it
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK gives excellent
UNK_UNK yeah i have no clue
UNK_UNK Nope, havent changed anything
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK Okay. I played around with it at the beginning and I don't think my FOS has a huge affect on the overall FOS. My mass is only 3.17, and my FOS is at 2. That's where I thought I would keep it for now.
UNK_UNK yo bro
UNK_UNK 5.82
UNK_UNK what mass are you using?
UNK_UNK So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
UNK_UNK our mass is too high rn
UNK_UNK It just looks like the FOS went down a lot
UNK_UNK the $20 we just won
UNK_UNK or it
UNK_UNK lets try 90
UNK_UNK what is your mass rn
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK looking good
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK we have exceleent
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK so hows life
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK is your design at the lowest possible weight?
UNK_UNK didnt change anything
UNK_UNK 1.75 and 6.07
UNK_UNK i asked
UNK_UNK crankshaft is talking, but he/she depends on flywheel
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK Moving bore diameter down to 55, that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on FOS as much. Rod designer is cool with it
UNK_UNK did you already push your broadcast?
UNK_UNK then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and FOS
UNK_UNK trying
UNK_UNK Will do
UNK_UNK FS optimization would be best. Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low FS
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK excellent?
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK no i do not
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK Pick a threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK bc thats the lowest and system level fos
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK shoot
UNK_UNK I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
UNK_UNK 20.86 (mass of .6)
UNK_UNK current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
UNK_UNK mass is 1.18 and thats with both as low as they can get
UNK_UNK X|_|O
UNK_UNK Are you happy with your piston diameter?
UNK_UNK ok conrod's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK what is your fos
UNK_UNK Is there anything I can do to help you?
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK stop changing
UNK_UNK our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK In D = 75?
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos?
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK nvmd
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high again
UNK_UNK lets leave it like this
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
UNK_UNK My strategy was to pick the part with lowest weight and factor of safety above 2
UNK_UNK ok. Im just trying to figure out how it all works together, I was talking with someone else and sometimes when I optimize my part it hurts the overall system
UNK_UNK I think 75 is the best right now
UNK_UNK What variables do you control?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK C does not affect the mass. However, as you increase C the factor of safety decreases
UNK_UNK 10 bucks aint bad
UNK_UNK sweet!
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK Yes please!
UNK_UNK nah man he chill
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK idk my FOS at 2 and weight minimized
UNK_UNK Hey, what are the updates you would have on the piston bore diameter if any
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK Does it kill the FOS if you decrease the offset below 150?
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK I used 70mm. Try to update yours
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK D =75
UNK_UNK I havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK yeah same
UNK_UNK Yea. I am working with my numbers to try and fix that.
UNK_UNK do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK Yes, my most recent design is what is broadcasted
UNK_UNK yeah it does now
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
UNK_UNK im at what ive always been at
UNK_UNK so it looks like our mass is killing us now
UNK_UNK its the smallest I can go
UNK_UNK Thank you. Will you please update me if it changes by more than 5?
UNK_UNK im at what ive always been at
UNK_UNK Yeah, what parameters are you designing for?
UNK_UNK I control bearing support offset (c) and crank-pin diameter (d_c))
UNK_UNK Is higher or lower D better for you?
UNK_UNK that is a lot, between you and the piston, you guys have the majority of the weight
UNK_UNK yeah i cant change anything. We done?
UNK_UNK flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
UNK_UNK that's what the piston guy is saying
UNK_UNK Hey, let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK I need to find two fitting ratios, r2 and r3. As these are increased, the both the mass and FOS decrease
UNK_UNK 7X7 fun
UNK_UNK Piston diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK With 0.12 mass.
UNK_UNK Yeah the mass looks like a problem
UNK_UNK why did it go down?
UNK_UNK cZ i was gonna try 80
UNK_UNK ur not wrong
UNK_UNK 2.47
UNK_UNK It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK What variables/equations do you deal with?
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK you can maximize the crank shaft bearing support offset if it benefits your design, it decreases my Fos but my FOS is so high that it doesnt matter much
UNK_UNK how do I broadcast?
UNK_UNK back to poor
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK yes i changed my numbers
UNK_UNK I say we stop changing
UNK_UNK I have not decided on them yet.
UNK_UNK we need to get this puppy down
UNK_UNK flywheel, are you good?
UNK_UNK )group: we are at good! hold on!
UNK_UNK time is up it says on my system
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK haven't changed anything on my ene
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK wait in the complete range?
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK we are in excellent right now
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK how much weight can you trim (generally)
UNK_UNK Do I have any variables that affect your result?
UNK_UNK yes agreed
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK go back to the value you had and itll go back
UNK_UNK Yes. My current design has a mass of 0.53 and a Fs of 2.1
UNK_UNK maybe lower if needed
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK whats the best fos you've had?
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK I'll try lowering my mass some
UNK_UNK My current fos in my table is 1.11
UNK_UNK im so confused what happened
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK yes, an old version, I'm running the simulations you requested noe
UNK_UNK for D = 85, min mass is 3.4
UNK_UNK 2.42
UNK_UNK how did the mass go up
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Can I have a current value of D
UNK_UNK 2.03 for fos
UNK_UNK do you need r2 or r3?
UNK_UNK FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK 3.11
UNK_UNK total
UNK_UNK D is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
UNK_UNK c bc yes
UNK_UNK so yes smaller piston diameter improves my fos
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK Heaviest Ms: 3.64 Highest FS: 6.92
UNK_UNK Hi Kamran
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK I've kept my numbers steady for a while
UNK_UNK what option are you currently on
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK No, looks like that L and r are different than mine.
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod lenth and the crank lenth
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on FOS
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK thickness = 10
UNK_UNK according to the thing on the screen it says very good
UNK_UNK 37.46 and 2.06
UNK_UNK My apologies, Plots were not showing up for me originally.  I'm on it
UNK_UNK I have not
UNK_UNK Yeah it is in good range
UNK_UNK FOS/
UNK_UNK im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
UNK_UNK yeah :/
UNK_UNK bore diameter is 40mm
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK What's the best crankshaft offset?
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK really?
UNK_UNK whenever I lower my factor of safety it seems to be having a large effect on the overall value for just a small change in mass
UNK_UNK Do you need to increase it?
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK what do you need
UNK_UNK hey what are your values?
UNK_UNK how does diameter affect your part?
UNK_UNK Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
UNK_UNK m = 0.16, fos = 4.66
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK that makes sense.  i just maxed my fos right now
UNK_UNK what diam are you using
UNK_UNK wont let me
UNK_UNK I'm using (0.7, 0.7) at the moment
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK ok i got fos 2.02 and mass of 5.82
UNK_UNK it is the lowest diameter i could do
UNK_UNK and crank pin diameter
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK woah were at poor now
UNK_UNK I cant
UNK_UNK FOS just went down
UNK_UNK Keep 70 mm I'm trying to get out of the poor region
UNK_UNK I think you need to try changing that variable and seeing if you can get a higher FOS
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK piston diameter
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK seems to be maximized at 2.62 ill keep trying other values
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK what is your weight at 75 and what is it at 80?
UNK_UNK back to very good
UNK_UNK although the new broadcast increased the mass
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK barely communicating
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK What are your values?
UNK_UNK Your FOS is huge
UNK_UNK what parameters do you have?
UNK_UNK 45
UNK_UNK is your objectives different?
UNK_UNK What affects your mass the most?
UNK_UNK Yeah flywheel isn't communicating
UNK_UNK ds and tf yes
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK recheck it
UNK_UNK FOS no
UNK_UNK truuu
UNK_UNK I can also change tH
UNK_UNK what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, what are you looking at?
UNK_UNK I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high right now
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK I have broadcasted the best value
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK im tryin g90 mm
UNK_UNK It's up
UNK_UNK right, but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations? Do you have one?
UNK_UNK ms = 6.72?
UNK_UNK Flywheel prob
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK how about FOS?
UNK_UNK i agree with that
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Yeah I am happy with this gg
UNK_UNK Looks like they're working with 75 right now, but just forgot to broadcast.
UNK_UNK whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
UNK_UNK just did it
UNK_UNK It's the same tradeoff for everyone
UNK_UNK they've been awfullly quiet
UNK_UNK Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all?
UNK_UNK awesome, thanks
UNK_UNK nobody change anythibn
UNK_UNK any preference on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I do the control ds but its the same
UNK_UNK fos is bad
UNK_UNK Smaller diameter is better for me
UNK_UNK one sec
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK Good working with you too
UNK_UNK who moved
UNK_UNK do we just sit here now?
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK Have you changed your values any?
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK is bore diameter piston diameter
UNK_UNK oh alright
UNK_UNK weight is 0.86
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK )group: we are at good! hold on!
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK try using 50 mm
UNK_UNK I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
UNK_UNK Hello, What parameters do you need from me
UNK_UNK aiming for a Fs slightly above 2 will let us minimize the mass and have a shot at the "very good
UNK_UNK Our FOS just went down to 0.96. Is yours still good?
UNK_UNK Bore diameter increased
UNK_UNK Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values?
UNK_UNK what is your current and fos/
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK are the dimensions still the same
UNK_UNK yeah agreed
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK I did not
UNK_UNK sounds good, flywheel now needs to check theirs i think
UNK_UNK we reached good
UNK_UNK Thats great, let's see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
UNK_UNK that will increase my mass, which is where we are too high
UNK_UNK lmao ya i noticed
UNK_UNK i refuse to go back to those lectures so im just gonna wait
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK My sim shows m=29.24, f=2.83
UNK_UNK I asked the guy, he said it was normal
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK 51 and 1.1 my values keep getting messed up
UNK_UNK it doesnt have to be that high
UNK_UNK What are the the piston bore diameter are we making?
UNK_UNK and then I depend on ds, t_f, and D
UNK_UNK Can you try decreasing diameter back to 45?
UNK_UNK sure!, I'm trying to play with c to get a higher FOS
UNK_UNK maybe we should just call it good
UNK_UNK greatjob
UNK_UNK Whats your current diameter?
UNK_UNK exactly
UNK_UNK my variables depend on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK thanks!! you too!
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
UNK_UNK piston diameter is 75, thickness is 10.5
UNK_UNK your part seems to be using the most mass so I'd say worry about that rather than FOS and see if the others can bump it up
UNK_UNK these are the variables I need to consider for design
UNK_UNK what is your mass/fos
UNK_UNK my highest FS is 1.23
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK just went up to .51 overall
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK what variable can you change  for "change variables of other sub-systems?"
UNK_UNK The current weight of my part is 0.1, so changing it won't affect it a whole lot.
UNK_UNK 2.85
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK Oh I see, yea I'll work on that now
UNK_UNK and im kamran
UNK_UNK I can hold mine above 2 and reduce but me having a high FOS might brign the overall up for not much more mass
UNK_UNK c=150, dc=45
UNK_UNK Between 45 and 50 would be wonderful!
UNK_UNK M = 6.72
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK i have 2.7 FS and 57 mass
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK my fos is still 700 so we can trim something on my end
UNK_UNK yup thats working!
UNK_UNK there is a default one but i'm trying to figure out how to change it
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK looks like we both need bore diameter from piston
UNK_UNK idk...
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK I've had it at the first one, but it says you may need my thickness to change
UNK_UNK Recheck your broadcast. it just went to poor
UNK_UNK what variables do you control?
UNK_UNK if you increase the diameter, the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK earlier we had pretty good results with a bore diameter of 75mm, should we give that a try again?
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK For D =85, what was your mass
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK ok the lower you have it the higher my Fos
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK On it
UNK_UNK mass is 1.7 and fos is 3.5
UNK_UNK 75 mm is the bore diameter
UNK_UNK to do that should I lower r, which could lower our FOS too much
UNK_UNK Ok sounds good
UNK_UNK are your masses high
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK Check for broadcast now
UNK_UNK if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples FOS
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at 2.03, so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety, that would be ideal
UNK_UNK lets decrease mass
UNK_UNK Piston-pin seems solid
UNK_UNK whats your mass at the moment
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK Okay let's keep it at that then
UNK_UNK is your fs still 2.1?
UNK_UNK they updated it
UNK_UNK They are t_I and r_1.
UNK_UNK okay, try and get the FOS even higher - we need to at least meet one of these criteria
UNK_UNK makes it way worse
UNK_UNK i changed to excellent
UNK_UNK anyone know why it went back to poor?
UNK_UNK shows it as broadcasting for me
UNK_UNK Rolid, really solid
UNK_UNK just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK No I do flywheel diameter
UNK_UNK my stats for flywheel are as follow
UNK_UNK I am at the time we got the best result now
UNK_UNK same and im currently there
UNK_UNK 6.61
UNK_UNK I'll try
UNK_UNK i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK It should be our lowest FS, but it's 0.51 instead of 2
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
UNK_UNK 1.27
UNK_UNK 2.06
UNK_UNK c = 85 and dc = 15
UNK_UNK Nope must be the other two that need that
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK are you chaning values and updating your broadcast?
UNK_UNK 1.35, I wonder who has 0.61
UNK_UNK mass
UNK_UNK did you  broadcast your value?
UNK_UNK ya the fos is so bad
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK ok just making sure it updates
UNK_UNK If you decrease you piston diameter does it decrease mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK I think so too
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Can we lower that? It might drop mass.
UNK_UNK Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
UNK_UNK duh
UNK_UNK Yeah we just need mass to go down
UNK_UNK haven't changed anything on my end, that's weird
UNK_UNK will let you know in few minutes
UNK_UNK did you change your mass a lot just now
UNK_UNK what is your FOS
UNK_UNK ok can u tell everyone that we agreed to move? i will also!
UNK_UNK well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
UNK_UNK And the mass for my component is 0.55
UNK_UNK by the way, I can get an fs of 10.19 if you go down to 75
UNK_UNK I'm pretty sure no one depends on my variables though
UNK_UNK okay, i havent updated in awhile
UNK_UNK really?
UNK_UNK is your fos still 2.01 ?
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK Yea I just asked him
UNK_UNK Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
UNK_UNK Thanks. What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the fos
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK yea we're at excellent
UNK_UNK Where is your FOS at?
UNK_UNK Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
UNK_UNK why
UNK_UNK I have piston-pin length and piston pin diameter, so let me know if youd like me to change any of those values
UNK_UNK Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
UNK_UNK Ok.
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK I am not sure
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Not by much. I can find values that work for it quickly
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK i dont think so
UNK_UNK yup trying 85 now
UNK_UNK and a tH of 10.5
UNK_UNK are you changing anything ?
UNK_UNK Hey
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, conrod has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK Me neither. I think it was flywheel?
UNK_UNK What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
UNK_UNK I think were good. We are at the highest point we can be. Good job!
UNK_UNK my masss is 6.28
UNK_UNK 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
UNK_UNK You have bore diameter too?
UNK_UNK I agree, I also can change the Piston head thickness.
UNK_UNK Which part do you think has the most mass? mine is small but i can chang FOS a lot
UNK_UNK Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK i talked to the TA and the fos of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing. In other words, that number doesn't relate to a single person't part apparently
UNK_UNK piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
UNK_UNK Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
UNK_UNK I don't think it is
UNK_UNK My part only accounts for only 0.1 so I can't do much for mass
UNK_UNK I changed my FOS to around 30 by adding 0.07 kg
UNK_UNK interesting
UNK_UNK DONT CHANGE
UNK_UNK yeah drop that to like 1.5 if you can
UNK_UNK i know
UNK_UNK do you have the 1.65 fos?
UNK_UNK what are your mass/fos
UNK_UNK Have you made any progress on the piston diameter D?
UNK_UNK no only on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
UNK_UNK Brendan
UNK_UNK true. what's your mass?
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK can you get that FOS up?
UNK_UNK I broadcasted something but then i changed it now
UNK_UNK Broadcast your latest values
UNK_UNK Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK Our mass just increased a lot
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK X _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ _ _
UNK_UNK DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
UNK_UNK Did you change something?
UNK_UNK are you still updating mass? we were in excellent
UNK_UNK mine is 2.44
UNK_UNK maybe use a  smaller c
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK I think we can keep going
UNK_UNK That's alright, as long as we have a FOS above 2
UNK_UNK dont change anything hahah
UNK_UNK Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel diameter
UNK_UNK Ok now it dropped
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK _|_|o
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK 0.1 to 3.24 for mass, 1.72 to 54.23 for FS.
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
UNK_UNK okay so my FOS is over 2000 for any design parameters and the mass is less than 2 so I can't figure out how my design affects everyone
UNK_UNK mm
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK most of mass is in piston and flywheel
UNK_UNK I need to change D to 85 though
UNK_UNK Thanks!
UNK_UNK how does the piston bore diameter affect your equations?
UNK_UNK DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
UNK_UNK whats your name fam?
UNK_UNK 6.45 now
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK m=0.07 FOS=1.23
UNK_UNK mine are piston diameter and head thickness
UNK_UNK by about .7 or 1
UNK_UNK rip too late
UNK_UNK Lost a great deal on FOS.
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK larger has a better FOS but the currently I used 45 and it's just high enough
UNK_UNK i'm determining dc and c
UNK_UNK Mass is 0.1 right?
UNK_UNK the other values on our team are like between 2.5 and 5000
UNK_UNK crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter, so I used 70mm
UNK_UNK does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
UNK_UNK its just flywheel that is rich apparently and can afford to experiment
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK did you change anything?>
UNK_UNK whoever changed please go back
UNK_UNK does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
UNK_UNK sorry i wrote backwards, increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
UNK_UNK I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used
UNK_UNK We need to get the fos higher even if it means the mass is greater than 35
UNK_UNK Nice!
UNK_UNK ok same
UNK_UNK nor crankshaft
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK on it
UNK_UNK try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
UNK_UNK What is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK 40 inches currently
UNK_UNK crankshaft weighs the most i think
UNK_UNK I'd minimzie mass
UNK_UNK I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do
UNK_UNK very big
UNK_UNK my mass is pretty low already. But make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK We're good\
UNK_UNK I'm using 47.5
UNK_UNK lets try only  small changes now since we are at very good, maybe make it to excellent
UNK_UNK wow ok
UNK_UNK Wanna call it?
UNK_UNK What is your FOS right now?
UNK_UNK If I increase the Piston Diameter, how much will it affect your FOS
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK oh dang
UNK_UNK im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety
UNK_UNK t1 or tf?
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK So you want to minimize mass, but increase FOS?
UNK_UNK Ok, that's odd
UNK_UNK Oh ok mine just updated
UNK_UNK any good values for the piston bore D?
UNK_UNK they just not responding to messages?
UNK_UNK now mass is 1.18
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK I currently have D set at 40
UNK_UNK heyhey
UNK_UNK yes, do you need that changed?
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
UNK_UNK min with highest fos
UNK_UNK Each part should be at 2
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Im at 12 60 now.
UNK_UNK and we are just trying to optimize somehow?
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK 2.77
UNK_UNK 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK "Good"
UNK_UNK fos went up
UNK_UNK I haven't broadcasted yet ho
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK we can try smaller mass
UNK_UNK Yep just got paid
UNK_UNK Me too
UNK_UNK and which do you need
UNK_UNK i did try it a few minutes ago, did anythjing change? Ill try it again
UNK_UNK we are so close
UNK_UNK We were at excellent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK Is there any way you can lower your weight?
UNK_UNK I think we should be good, just don't change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
UNK_UNK For the current bore diameter, yes. If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results
UNK_UNK adjust which part?
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK okay so the piston and I also have that variable and we have it at 47.5 currently
UNK_UNK That's what I'm altering
UNK_UNK we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
UNK_UNK once you figure it out
UNK_UNK I haven't it increases mass and decreases FOS so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn't make sense on my end
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK how much does your fos increase though? because then we could save mass in other parts
UNK_UNK Also, what is optimal in terms of parameters for you?
UNK_UNK cats game
UNK_UNK We need to meet at least one of these criteria
UNK_UNK Maybe? My pin length is called l1 (el 1) and I also control the inner and outer diameter of the pin (d0 and di)
UNK_UNK #ERROR!
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK were they significantly different twenty minutes ago?
UNK_UNK Got and idea for the flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at very good
UNK_UNK What are you using as your diameter
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK not anymore. do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK do you wanna lower the mass further to see what we get or no?
UNK_UNK diameter is 25
UNK_UNK Im on mine rn with 0.1
UNK_UNK whats it to u
UNK_UNK New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Tractor king
UNK_UNK we can optimize c and tf looks like
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK is this scooter
UNK_UNK D = 85, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK might be piston
UNK_UNK but piston pin designer has lopw fos
UNK_UNK GOOD
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK flywheel is 0.52 currently
UNK_UNK I think I have the easiest part lol.  No one's asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK What just changed?
UNK_UNK rn my mass is 6.5 and fos is 2.09
UNK_UNK its fine now
UNK_UNK Actually its better now
UNK_UNK Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK I mean, its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads. So that's normal.
UNK_UNK like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
UNK_UNK are you using my dc dimension?
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
UNK_UNK but im strugling with mass
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK What weight are you at?
UNK_UNK and keep D lower
UNK_UNK there ya go
UNK_UNK I'm using 85 so my mass now is 6.72
UNK_UNK its as small as itll go
UNK_UNK our factor of safety went down
UNK_UNK what about the fos?
UNK_UNK you need to change your current broadcast
UNK_UNK enough money for me
UNK_UNK have you reached an ideal value for your part yet?
UNK_UNK piston range is pretty high
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK YOurs is currently the bottleneck
UNK_UNK on my broadcast thing theyre just called r2 and r3.  r2 is the ratio of piston pin length to diameter and r3 is piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK hey did you find a diameter for the piston bore?
UNK_UNK try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
UNK_UNK mine is 1215
UNK_UNK The lowest offset possible would be ideal for the mass and FoS for the crankshaft
UNK_UNK can you please share your design variables so that we know what each needs
UNK_UNK I think that works, i'm not sure how that affects the flyweel but I will change it to offset of 60 which is minimum
UNK_UNK so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
UNK_UNK "Select a design to broadcast"
UNK_UNK I haven't changed the broadcast for awhile, it must be someone else
UNK_UNK I will ask others
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK The crankshaft has FOS = 3.05 and mass = 1.33 and that's about the lowest mass I can get with FOS > 2
UNK_UNK i didnt
UNK_UNK we need to cut down on mass
UNK_UNK I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK ok my m is .53 and fos is 1929
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
UNK_UNK I am getting around 2.26-2.95
UNK_UNK mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
UNK_UNK No, i dont think so. I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter 
UNK_UNK ds = 50
UNK_UNK Done
UNK_UNK try not to change anything until you talk to someone
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
UNK_UNK I'm not sure how this works tbh haha
UNK_UNK have you considered using 75?
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK can you try to reduce tf at all
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK that's not good. why did you tell me to increase the diameter?
UNK_UNK Have you changed bore diameter at all?
UNK_UNK ready?
UNK_UNK it got worse so i would change it back
UNK_UNK O|X|X
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK time is up i believe
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK your part seems pretty light how large can you make the FOS
UNK_UNK for my part or the whole thing?
UNK_UNK Changing D from 40 to 70 lowers the FOS drastically like ~ 3.0 but lowers the mass just a bit like ~ 0.1kg
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK what mass do you have for the flywheel?
UNK_UNK 3.03
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK sorry, dc\
UNK_UNK Sweet we're at excellent quality rn
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK My bad that wasn't clear, I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high FOS to begin with
UNK_UNK Can you change ds to 55 and braodcast
UNK_UNK idk i didnt change
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
UNK_UNK Hi what is the mass that you are currently using?
UNK_UNK Ok great
UNK_UNK We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
UNK_UNK what is the range of masses you can select?
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK i dropped 1 kg with 3 fos
UNK_UNK ok it went up to 300 rn
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK all good
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK mainly because mass
UNK_UNK ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK okay perfect
UNK_UNK basically c = 85  and dc =15
UNK_UNK weight is an output for me. The lowest weight I can get with a passable factor of safety at the current bore is 0.53
UNK_UNK did u try everyone else? cause our mass is too high
UNK_UNK Group: alert everyone before you change anything!\
UNK_UNK mine is 2.47
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK Not with the current piston parameters. I'll see if he can change things so I can get a FOS back over 3
UNK_UNK In my simulation I increased Tf to 51. It brought the fos down ever so slightly, but brought down the mass by 2 kg for some reason
UNK_UNK What is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK t_f = 12.0 and d_s = 60.0
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
UNK_UNK no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio
UNK_UNK thats if D = 45 where D is the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK Sorry, t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length.
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK i gotchu
UNK_UNK it said very good but someone changed someting
UNK_UNK kg
UNK_UNK GROUP: keep communicating!
UNK_UNK ooooo it went down but so did FOS
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK so for you design a lower c is better?  does dc affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK What is your current bearing offset?
UNK_UNK its good now just mass to worry about
UNK_UNK hahah this is rough
UNK_UNK How's the design going? I think we got to an excellent rating already!
UNK_UNK who many rounds do we getr?
UNK_UNK sup
UNK_UNK currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
UNK_UNK I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK try increasing your fos without increasing mass too much
UNK_UNK thats the only reason i knew how to do hw prob3
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier
UNK_UNK I am a little confused. I though I knew what I was doing, but when I hit broadcast my numbers for the subsystem changed.
UNK_UNK we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
UNK_UNK Increase
UNK_UNK and fos
UNK_UNK do you have your fos as close to 2
UNK_UNK I have around 10
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK i willl try decreasing dc
UNK_UNK yes!
UNK_UNK nothing actually
UNK_UNK whats your fos?
UNK_UNK 1.14
UNK_UNK yeah its fine i jsut want $17
UNK_UNK Piston diameter of 75
UNK_UNK 43 or lower for fos greater than 2
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK my factor of safety is maximized at low c values
UNK_UNK okay, I'll try using that now
UNK_UNK Trying to figure out what's happening
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK We've got a "Good" engine
UNK_UNK K, lowest I can make my weight with FOS>2 is 5.42 which is a big improvement
UNK_UNK Yes that is what I have input
UNK_UNK i can get my mass between 0.5 and 0.6, and still have a pretty high FOS
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK I cant get a response tho
UNK_UNK Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller? What about the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK I think you need to change your c value
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK also i forgot fos is just the minimum value not an average
UNK_UNK 0.63 mass
UNK_UNK hey
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK What can you change that increases your FOS?
UNK_UNK our mass seems to be going up, are you using the original values?
UNK_UNK yeah but that increase weight by .5 gram is that worth it for you
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK did you change your mass a lot just now
UNK_UNK I have my diameter set to 40, but that has likely changed since I last chacked
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK Do you need me to change anything?
UNK_UNK I haven't changed my dimensions for awhile now, hope that helps
UNK_UNK i haven't updated
UNK_UNK I am staying at m 0.07 and fs 1.23
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at good
UNK_UNK only the crankshaft offset
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK What's your mass?
UNK_UNK i'm trying to minimize weight while keeping fos around 2
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK what do you control and what do you need
UNK_UNK how
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK That would be my guess too.
UNK_UNK or global?
UNK_UNK no they remain the same
UNK_UNK i broadcasted my best
UNK_UNK It says currently broadcasting 42 on my end
UNK_UNK kmaybe not
UNK_UNK Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
UNK_UNK first day on the job or something?
UNK_UNK you too!
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS?
UNK_UNK i don't believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
UNK_UNK I think it's at 2 right now
UNK_UNK mass = 4, FoS = 2.4
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK do you need to know any flywheel variables?
UNK_UNK What is the mass of your components?
UNK_UNK Ok cool
UNK_UNK 90
UNK_UNK Do you need flywheel's thickness?
UNK_UNK i think you might have to increase it
UNK_UNK just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK what's your fos ?
UNK_UNK how much weight can you reduce roughly
UNK_UNK while keeping the fos fixed
UNK_UNK 70
UNK_UNK i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
UNK_UNK ive been at the first broadcast for a while now
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK We need FOS to be around 1.5
UNK_UNK got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
UNK_UNK what do you need to increase it?
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK okay i just put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
UNK_UNK Ok that's what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes
UNK_UNK I've been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing D, but I haven't gotten any response.
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK we're at good
UNK_UNK I'll be on it
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK What are your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK But FOS is low
UNK_UNK So we can keep it low
UNK_UNK Did you make any change after it was at very good?
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK what variable do you control?
UNK_UNK the mass of the piston is currently 2.23
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK Yeah, that was weird haha
UNK_UNK *increaseing
UNK_UNK ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK on the projector
UNK_UNK we went from excellent to poor, rip
UNK_UNK same here, any small decrease in mass lowers FOS by a lot for me
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK GOOD***
UNK_UNK heyy is there anyway you could reduce the weight slightly?
UNK_UNK do you need any of my variables?
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77 now, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK let me check
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK did oyu change?
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK I'll ask them
UNK_UNK piston-pin?
UNK_UNK Are you still running with diameter of 40
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK how much mass is your part?
UNK_UNK 1643.92?
UNK_UNK Great - let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK I don't think you need anything from me, do you?
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK did it.  we need to drop mass more still
UNK_UNK its helpful to get the ball rolling
UNK_UNK okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
UNK_UNK which do you need
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK if you change the diameter to 65
UNK_UNK Whats the max fos you can get? without adding too much weight
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK what is your mas and fos?
UNK_UNK It only matters about our lowest one I believe
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK 200 for offset works better for me
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, try reducing the mass
UNK_UNK ds is 20
UNK_UNK for the last simulation it is 43
UNK_UNK Keep your FOS above 2
UNK_UNK hmm, anything I can do to help reduce your mass?
UNK_UNK Yeah still at 40 just made thickness smaller
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK flywheel guy was that you
UNK_UNK can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera?
UNK_UNK yee it has been good working with you as well
UNK_UNK i did it
UNK_UNK What's your mass?
UNK_UNK Nope, I have held mine constant since i cant get better than mass: 1.61 and FOS: 1.35
UNK_UNK ya, and im at poor quality, are you as well?
UNK_UNK 80 worked good for me
UNK_UNK 12 for tf and 60 for ds, my foss shows it at 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
UNK_UNK now we are at poor again...
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK what up
UNK_UNK lets gooo
UNK_UNK just changed it to 25 d and t is 10
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK I just increased it by 2 mm and we are still slightly below our mass requirement
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK group: who wants to go next?
UNK_UNK Mine neither
UNK_UNK Cool, and that brings the piston-pin FOS to just under 2
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK I control Flywheel thickness and Flywheel shaft diameter. I need Crankshaft Bearing Offset
UNK_UNK hmmm okay
UNK_UNK We just hit very good
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK Global requirements top of page
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK Can you increase your diameter?
UNK_UNK what is your current ds
UNK_UNK dc is crank-pin diameter
UNK_UNK so i got an fos of 3.39 and mass of 0.11
UNK_UNK what I'm looking at is 60 and 12
UNK_UNK Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
UNK_UNK k
UNK_UNK looks like we're done?
UNK_UNK I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts. I dont need them, fos = 0.71 now
UNK_UNK Where is the "change variables of other subsystems" button that it talks about in the handout?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Hello my friend
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK havent found a combination better than .06 and 2.62
UNK_UNK did you get FOS as 1.81?
UNK_UNK before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
UNK_UNK yea sure
UNK_UNK Ok updated broadcast, now we're close
UNK_UNK What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK How does the bearing support offset affect your part?
UNK_UNK We only need above 2, so try as must as you can to lower the mass
UNK_UNK fake
UNK_UNK is diameter 90
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK also reducing c significantly reduces the FOS
UNK_UNK Ok 60 is my lowest possible so I'll leave it at that
UNK_UNK ok got it
UNK_UNK i wouldnt up your weight
UNK_UNK the new design looks real good
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK nobofy left the room did they?
UNK_UNK doesnt have to be ;)
UNK_UNK what is your FOS now?
UNK_UNK yes, as high as we can get FOS the better
UNK_UNK Maybe ask around
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK 3.21
UNK_UNK what bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK I do not
UNK_UNK I'm at Mass 0.69 and FOS 3.84. We need to find some more weight to up your FOS
UNK_UNK Ok, I'm talking to the crankshaft guy to figure out how it affects his FOS because he is the one with the lowest FOS right now
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK I'm about to drop the fos and mass because rod designer said it might help them
UNK_UNK Someone picked an FS of 0.51
UNK_UNK Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
UNK_UNK the crankshafts mass is really high
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK Currently I'm at 7.69
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK on my screen it says your limit is between 150 and 300?
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK I don't know if I can get a FOS over 1 with that diameter
UNK_UNK hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod. my variables are l1 (length of the pin), and the inner and outer diameter of the pin (di, d0)
UNK_UNK do you have offset value?
UNK_UNK We are good, he said his FOS went up when I changed it down to 45
UNK_UNK why?
UNK_UNK Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK looks like we're good
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK hah punnnnnnny
UNK_UNK 4000
UNK_UNK Diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK cool we are good
UNK_UNK Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
UNK_UNK t = 8
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK Oh I've got a different system FOS, mine is about 2
UNK_UNK Awesome, thank you. Are you in control of that diameter?
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
UNK_UNK ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed
UNK_UNK Should have gone through? C= 150, dc=50
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK Our FOS just dropped a ton
UNK_UNK ranges
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and fos
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK Do what you need to do to get FoS > 1.5 and then we can adjust masses from there
UNK_UNK 3.91
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out, it seems really large
UNK_UNK I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
UNK_UNK Ohhh truee didn't think about that. Hmmm
UNK_UNK And the mass?
UNK_UNK i havent changed
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK sorry I was distracted by other teammates\
UNK_UNK 1.92
UNK_UNK unless it drastically changes the mass
UNK_UNK That is my current max FOS. It can change some based on what piston diameter I have
UNK_UNK what mass are you working with?
UNK_UNK I have not decided yet. What would help you most?
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK cause i havent been changing my stuff and its fluctuating
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK its the flywheel guy
UNK_UNK That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK Made diameter 75
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK make it higher
UNK_UNK ok i increased dc and it got better?
UNK_UNK Yeah one sec
UNK_UNK Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot.
UNK_UNK ok mine are c and dc will look into those
UNK_UNK Oh yeah okay.
UNK_UNK yeah im pretty confident mine is not gonna work
UNK_UNK *he or she
UNK_UNK mine is a diameter and i think it relates to piston
UNK_UNK but we can try to imporve
UNK_UNK for subsytsem
UNK_UNK input shaft wheel diameter
UNK_UNK The piston has a diameter of 75
UNK_UNK did you get your mass down?
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight?
UNK_UNK if I increase the offset, mass increases
UNK_UNK is it each part or globally
UNK_UNK im guessing flywheel
UNK_UNK what ranges of mass do you have for your part?
UNK_UNK yeah that is what im using
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK it's 5625 but my part has a weird fos
UNK_UNK what is your fos? can you reduce your mass at all while staying above fos=2.1
UNK_UNK Oh I did not receive that update, I'll try my numbers at 40 
UNK_UNK Great - thanks
UNK_UNK oof
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad
UNK_UNK It just changed back to good
UNK_UNK do you need my thickness to increase?
UNK_UNK No, my FOS values are all greater than 300.
UNK_UNK how's your FOS looking
UNK_UNK like my FS just went from 1.9 to 2.2 without me changin anything for my part
UNK_UNK dont change it theyre changing it back
UNK_UNK use 43mm shaft diameter. The crankshaft engineer gave me that value recently
UNK_UNK please do
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK i waaaaaant mooooney
UNK_UNK check
UNK_UNK ms:1.17 fs:2.0
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK ok will try some other variations
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK need: piston bore diamter
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK I let the mknow
UNK_UNK i can get higher fos with relatively low m so maybe we can leverage this
UNK_UNK Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK what happened to our FOS oh geez
UNK_UNK SAme
UNK_UNK q4: did we talk about it in our classes this semester?
UNK_UNK my objective is to maximize it
UNK_UNK and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK not sure whose is 1.79
UNK_UNK D= 47.4 or 40 for me
UNK_UNK and we need all the help we can get with fs
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, try reducing the amss
UNK_UNK for both fos and mass?
UNK_UNK Noted
UNK_UNK ok thats not me then. maybe ask around
UNK_UNK crank is 30 lbs alone
UNK_UNK Is your FOS twelve hundred??!
UNK_UNK mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
UNK_UNK Yea, nvm we're good i think
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
UNK_UNK flywheel changed a value and i lost 5 lbs!
UNK_UNK okay!
UNK_UNK I think the other designers have way too high fos's
UNK_UNK Alright, I will try to figure that out
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Don't think so
UNK_UNK No, because I haven't needed to. I'm mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now.
UNK_UNK I do not believe so
UNK_UNK Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
UNK_UNK the values range as other engineers alter their broadcasted values
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK 60 mm
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK its 4821.91
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK mine is 1.48
UNK_UNK if i make the piston diameter smaller, my FOS goes up
UNK_UNK sorry yes, 90 mm for bore D, I control the r values
UNK_UNK Yep, values finalized
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK It does, if one of the engineers changes their dimensions mine are forced to change
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there?
UNK_UNK fos = 2.36
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK i kinda wanna know who the other people are
UNK_UNK from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK I see it
UNK_UNK are you conerned with dimension dc?
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK mass 27.44
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK c:150 dc:50
UNK_UNK ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve fos some with other parts
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK I hit up the piston but they never got back to me
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK Ok with the minimum mass, for the flywheel, Fs is still 1215
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK Is there any way you can reduce D?
UNK_UNK yeah it's a lot heavier
UNK_UNK my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
UNK_UNK I can minimize my diameter
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK how did the mass increase by this much
UNK_UNK 82.5, that is the second lowest for me
UNK_UNK what is your mass currently?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK I have not changed mine
UNK_UNK We did
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK 1.48, my mass is so small im just trying to increase my fos
UNK_UNK How about you?
UNK_UNK how about increasing fos?
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK If the piston diameter is 75, I can get a good mix of mass and fs
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK I can try
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos?
UNK_UNK and also maximizing all the other variables I need
UNK_UNK at 47.5 or 55?
UNK_UNK ok \
UNK_UNK We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK i think that will raise my FOS and lower weight
UNK_UNK ok make sure your fos is never below 2
UNK_UNK I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77
UNK_UNK Nevermind we getting there!
UNK_UNK It's not me
UNK_UNK sounds good but do you have any more room to reduce mass? I'm about the smallest I can make my parts
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK No I do not, I would consult the piston
UNK_UNK Keeping it 45!
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK doing that now
UNK_UNK whats your fos? mine is 2.09, piston is 2.09 as well
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK changed piston back to 40 mm
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK what's your max mass?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK we already had it once
UNK_UNK okay, so you part and my part are the heaviest
UNK_UNK Do you know why the mass is so high?
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK ...
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK q3: does it hav emoving parts
UNK_UNK Not sure yet.
UNK_UNK do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
UNK_UNK lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK its huge its 15886
UNK_UNK Hows it looking now
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK What are your current parameters?
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK Would a larger bore work better for you? I could go to about 45 but beyond that, my FOS goes below 1.7. My FOS is currently at 3.44 with a bore of 40
UNK_UNK undo what you did
UNK_UNK Do you know whats up
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the fos while minimizing its mass
UNK_UNK i made my connector rod to crank length ratio 4
UNK_UNK 2.31
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK ok your numbers seem ok idk where this low fos came from it was just good]
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK For the diameter it is 25 right now
UNK_UNK Every 10 D I decrease from 70, mass decrease like 0.2-0.3
UNK_UNK what is your flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK 3.42
UNK_UNK yeah thats ok the fos for othee's will be less
UNK_UNK dc is the weight variable for me
UNK_UNK Anything changing when you change your numbers now?
UNK_UNK smaller gives me a much better fos
UNK_UNK *anyone has lower FOS change when mass dec?
UNK_UNK Agreed
UNK_UNK try to get the mass down below 40
UNK_UNK I dont no
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK ok let me know if you want to change something
UNK_UNK BTW, shaved my mass down a tad. m = 0.52 now
UNK_UNK I don't have control over any diameters
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK Okay sounds good
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK yep trying my best now - we need to meet at least one of the criteria
UNK_UNK it is the smallest it can be
UNK_UNK yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
UNK_UNK oh right
UNK_UNK It just updated
UNK_UNK what's your mass ?
UNK_UNK Same for me my fos drops waaaay down and shaves only 0.12 from m
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK I don't have control over that. I believe that's the piston.
UNK_UNK Literally, there is not
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK i have set it to those values
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK m=0.07 FOS=1.23
UNK_UNK yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back
UNK_UNK My mass is 1.12, Fos is 4707
UNK_UNK We need to save weight.
UNK_UNK My simulation would be excellent, the broadcast was very good and now poor?
UNK_UNK keep fos around 2 never below
UNK_UNK bearing is 150, pin is 50 mm
UNK_UNK Currently is 21.49 for me, FoS is 1.74
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
UNK_UNK ok nvm
UNK_UNK my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK We're close, guys
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK alright yeah, I'm at lowest possible mass (0.1) and fos is 2.77
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized
UNK_UNK definitely
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK can you try using 50 mm? and try to maximize the fos?
UNK_UNK no i dont have control of it
UNK_UNK try 40?
UNK_UNK i thought we are done?
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK 3.62
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
UNK_UNK The length of the crankshaft
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK I think this is a trap
UNK_UNK *same
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK whats the d and t values you
UNK_UNK maximize FOS
UNK_UNK against one of the walls
UNK_UNK my FOS is the lowest at 2.03, so you can probably make it even smaller if possible
UNK_UNK 1215
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK 17.5 would be great, lowers mass a ton
UNK_UNK I had it at m = 0.04 and f = 0.74 when the status of the engine was good
UNK_UNK let me check
UNK_UNK Is either tf or ds a variable of other subsystems for you?
UNK_UNK My dimension?
UNK_UNK lowest *
UNK_UNK our global FS just the lowest part FS you think
UNK_UNK yeah, working on it
UNK_UNK What are your ranges?
UNK_UNK Did you change anything?
UNK_UNK we are at very good
UNK_UNK what have you been in control of?
UNK_UNK re using now?
UNK_UNK yeah for sure him
UNK_UNK are you changing things
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK U mean 0.672?
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK Im still at poor quality... are you as well?
UNK_UNK one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
UNK_UNK the bearing support offset?
UNK_UNK that's cool
UNK_UNK ok let me see how that effects my design
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK and t_h is 2
UNK_UNK I updated
UNK_UNK i updated another design
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod
UNK_UNK doth D and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass
UNK_UNK i was at t=10 and d=15 or 20
UNK_UNK what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
UNK_UNK looking at that now
UNK_UNK (piston head)
UNK_UNK what is your fs
UNK_UNK no only D
UNK_UNK Just changed it and it didn't help much
UNK_UNK okay that seems good
UNK_UNK FS?
UNK_UNK Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
UNK_UNK what is your mass currently?
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
UNK_UNK TA is saying time is up
UNK_UNK No, you?
UNK_UNK yea
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK Piston Bore I am currently working with is 55mm
UNK_UNK but then
UNK_UNK okay, the bearing support offset should be minimized for my part and an increasing crank pin diameter increases my FOS
UNK_UNK I can increase my mass toi 0.75 and my Fos to 24.38
UNK_UNK alright, guess no then
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK Ok I can do that
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK Looks like moving from 90 up to 105 doesn't benefit me much in terms of the FoS/mass ratio
UNK_UNK what value are you using because my design is dependant on that value
UNK_UNK yeah agreed, it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect, so im going to stick to maximizing FOS
UNK_UNK okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
UNK_UNK i meant for your individual part
UNK_UNK wassup
UNK_UNK The bore diameter?
UNK_UNK oh okay my handout said piston pin diameter should be displayed but isnt
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK oops sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK yeah that makes sense
UNK_UNK just as a reference
UNK_UNK okay sounds good
UNK_UNK my design is basically fixed, i found a good design that have decent fos but not too heavy
UNK_UNK sweet, ill update my FOS
UNK_UNK c = 85 dc = 15
UNK_UNK lets just try getting our mass down
UNK_UNK lol
UNK_UNK my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter
UNK_UNK no I don't need either
UNK_UNK What is your range of fos?
UNK_UNK hmm i reverted to previous dimensions
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Hello! what's the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Is higher or lower D better for you?
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Could yo uoptimize your fos? I think your weight is mainly negligible
UNK_UNK Deciding on dimensions of a piston-pin
UNK_UNK The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
UNK_UNK do you need my rod cross section to increase?
UNK_UNK what c value do you currently have?
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK Yes, that's the minimum diameter I can use
UNK_UNK *person's
UNK_UNK See if you can bump that up
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK i think i will reach my  ideal values in a second
UNK_UNK just did
UNK_UNK ok. I have heard nothing from Crank Design
UNK_UNK we can
UNK_UNK Hi, please keep me updated on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I still see 40
UNK_UNK Try to lower it to 2
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK its at very good
UNK_UNK for c = 85 dc = 15 ds = 25 tf= 30 D = 70 fos = 2.37
UNK_UNK Tell me the tradeoffs
UNK_UNK 55mm
UNK_UNK Whichever works best for you
UNK_UNK ya we can always change it too
UNK_UNK oh wait, it might be the connecting rod
UNK_UNK it seems so, yet we are still over the mass limit?
UNK_UNK 3.05
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK yeah that is what i am thinking as well
UNK_UNK to simulate
UNK_UNK you need to broadcast your simulation results. after simulating, you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK Ok. I will make adjustments
UNK_UNK 24.3 at m = .75
UNK_UNK mostly in flywheel design, I'm updating my values to see how those work
UNK_UNK That's literally the lowest value i have that's above 2 though
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK check with the others
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK 1.29
UNK_UNK whats your FS
UNK_UNK 80,150,12,60
UNK_UNK I think my pin is what connects the crankshaft connecting rod to the piston
UNK_UNK m=4.28 fos=3.05
UNK_UNK global is at 2.3 right now
UNK_UNK which part of the piston are you handling?
UNK_UNK oh I see
UNK_UNK hows it going
UNK_UNK The piston can be any value between 3 and 15kg
UNK_UNK Check the top of the second page of the handout
UNK_UNK Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK I got good results with 55, but trying to bring down the mass
UNK_UNK Great
UNK_UNK piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length. All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK Where is your FOS at?
UNK_UNK try that
UNK_UNK go with 90
UNK_UNK What is your range for diameter?
UNK_UNK thats the most central point in my simulation
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK 1.3 and mass is too high
UNK_UNK th, D, m, fos
UNK_UNK Di the numbers change for you?
UNK_UNK I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
UNK_UNK But I have the minimum fos so I'll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
UNK_UNK 22.4 and 1.5
UNK_UNK what are your input params besides the bore diam?
UNK_UNK Yeah really
UNK_UNK let me know what you think crank bearing offset (c) will be
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK bad ok dont do that
UNK_UNK Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
UNK_UNK hot dog
UNK_UNK I haven't touched any
UNK_UNK thats getting better, Im working w the piston to find the best D and will let you konw when we do
UNK_UNK nope mine has been at 1.27
UNK_UNK hmm...
UNK_UNK go for the lower Ms that has an FS above 2
UNK_UNK REFRESH IT, ITS LOWER THAN 2 RIGHT NOW
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK I used 40 mm which is the minimum value I can use
UNK_UNK I am thanks for letting me know!
UNK_UNK Can you increase mass slightly?
UNK_UNK The crankshaft takes up the most amount in terms of mass but is it possible to lower the value any further than 2.43?
UNK_UNK What is your range for D?
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK gave me dimensions earlier
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK is*
UNK_UNK I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs > 2 design.
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos/
UNK_UNK try 65
UNK_UNK So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea
UNK_UNK lowest I could do is 75 for the weight
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK someone changed thier mass
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK Our dimensions line up at least
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their mass is 0.11
UNK_UNK yes so run it with those values a
UNK_UNK okay. Have you talked to the other subsystems about only changing one subsytem at a time?
UNK_UNK I have D at 40
UNK_UNK I think that doing that effects the other designs as well
UNK_UNK Ok we're doing well. We're at good s
UNK_UNK oh okay, sounds good
UNK_UNK decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety
UNK_UNK Yep
UNK_UNK and i have leeway with my factor of safety
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
UNK_UNK it is best for me
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK did you make a change?
UNK_UNK Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK I'm the low FOS of 2.01, can you cut any more mass out
UNK_UNK I'm guessing the crankshaft. the piston is .55 and the piston pin is 0.06
UNK_UNK what variables do you depend on?
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast
UNK_UNK i didnt change
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
UNK_UNK Hey so what changes have you made so far to the piston design?
UNK_UNK very close now
UNK_UNK my part doesnt effect mass very much
UNK_UNK See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK what variables do you use?
UNK_UNK for your ouputs only?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
UNK_UNK and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK yes, piston bore is 80
UNK_UNK I'll try again with new parameters
UNK_UNK I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK the minimum it gives me is 150
UNK_UNK its 2700
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK *of mass
UNK_UNK What could i do to help your fos go up?
UNK_UNK Its excellent now
UNK_UNK Who is the fly wheel designer ?
UNK_UNK you change let me lose 5 lbs! Thanks fellow engineer!!!
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK I did and piston should be low now. rod is only a mass of .14
UNK_UNK look at the chart on the last page of your booklet, we are shooting for the highest FOS and lowest mass
UNK_UNK awesome! go team
UNK_UNK what does thatdo?
UNK_UNK Okay try and change C
UNK_UNK but it's better
UNK_UNK I will change to 70
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK Hello! can you send me the ds and tf value>
UNK_UNK increasing c increases mass
UNK_UNK yes, let's do one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK i control Ti and r1
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK 11.11
UNK_UNK Hi! what the values you are using?
UNK_UNK yeah, I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can
UNK_UNK i have one more setting before im at my lowest
UNK_UNK If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit
UNK_UNK I haven't touched anything for a while
UNK_UNK what bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK mass is lowest it can be with FOS larger than 2, I'll try more decimals
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK >:(((((((((((
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop more mass
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK what is your bearing offset ?
UNK_UNK Okay, then you can do what you need to increase the FOS, then let me know the new D
UNK_UNK How is the factor of safety
UNK_UNK like one part has huge FS so they just minimized mass bc the part has FS over 100 no matter what option they choose
UNK_UNK no problem
UNK_UNK with a ratio of 4
UNK_UNK Its probably weighted. If we can raise the lowest fos to its max and the highest fos to its min mass it might work
UNK_UNK I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it?
UNK_UNK We've got a Good FoS now, just need to get mass down
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK good job team
UNK_UNK not that high
UNK_UNK I think hes at fos 1.64 and mass of 2,26 but that was a while ago
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK reply when done
UNK_UNK So we are in good range right now
UNK_UNK it's just good
UNK_UNK We're still seeing 80 as the globally broadcast value. Weird.
UNK_UNK no keep it low
UNK_UNK so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK WE are GOOD
UNK_UNK What factors are you interested in?
UNK_UNK What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK Because they asked me for that
UNK_UNK i  have fos at 3.23
UNK_UNK Just did max, 105!
UNK_UNK sweet we're at excellent
UNK_UNK Do you need either of those?
UNK_UNK diameter D has been at 40 whole time
UNK_UNK because mine still read as excellent when my diameter was at 80
UNK_UNK idk what changed but quality just dropped
UNK_UNK 82.5 i was thinking, the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
UNK_UNK 150 mm
UNK_UNK got it, hmmm
UNK_UNK Hi, what is the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK m = 0.07 and fos = 1.59
UNK_UNK Hold where you are
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK leave yours as is for now, piston is biggest factor rn
UNK_UNK mass = 11.09
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK what diameter are you sitting at?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Thanks.  If you need them, Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0
UNK_UNK Im just trying to figure out how everything fits. We have to need to set certain parameters based on others
UNK_UNK Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
UNK_UNK I'm pretty sure I will leave the thickness at 10 mm
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK good good. Lets keep it that way
UNK_UNK I don't think so, all I need is piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his.her mass, crankshaft is the heaviest part
UNK_UNK u mean 80?
UNK_UNK Yeah. mass is still high though
UNK_UNK we were at 3.5 mass and 1.5 fos but now it is worse
UNK_UNK mass = 1.27 and f_os = 15886.04
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK yep i think so
UNK_UNK Does a large Flywheel mass help you?
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my value
UNK_UNK oh there we go
UNK_UNK I can choose diameter between 75 and 105
UNK_UNK yep...
UNK_UNK someone change thier mass
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK if u want to adjust urs, u can announce to all chats
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK he and i talked
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK 75 mm
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK ey ywe did it
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK what is your crankshaft mass? And are you still using 70 for your crankshaft offset?
UNK_UNK By how much would be good for you?
UNK_UNK What did u choose for D?
UNK_UNK itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
UNK_UNK wait so I asked piston to lower his mass. So now my fos is lowered to 70, 
UNK_UNK i havent changed anything
UNK_UNK Wait, did you just change a value?
UNK_UNK it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
UNK_UNK Yeah I put my thickness and diameter to make ms=0.52
UNK_UNK did u get the light sensor working
UNK_UNK hiyo
UNK_UNK and one sec for the other one
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK What parameters increaes your fos or mass?
UNK_UNK alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
UNK_UNK Are you there
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK Gotcha. We've got to get our FoS up to 1.5 if we're gonna get out of the poor category
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK more like first hour
UNK_UNK Yo
UNK_UNK ok ill leave it then
UNK_UNK now 1.46
UNK_UNK yeah if it lowers FOS too much, weshouldnt
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK now its 4.92
UNK_UNK and how so?
UNK_UNK 40 mm
UNK_UNK Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK are you the conrod designer
UNK_UNK we got it, don't change things
UNK_UNK XI_IO
UNK_UNK idk how but our mass earlier was 33.29 or something
UNK_UNK minimized
UNK_UNK we need smaller mass
UNK_UNK yeah, what is it?
UNK_UNK My weight varies between 0.0 and 0.12 so im the wrong person to reduce weight
UNK_UNK 130
UNK_UNK tf = 12
UNK_UNK Mine are, but i have not made any drastic changes since. Your lowering of ds helped me shave off 2 more lbs
UNK_UNK We need an FS of 1.5
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK nor crankshaft
UNK_UNK mine only goes up to 30 max
UNK_UNK wanna shoot for excellent? :P
UNK_UNK yep i got it
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK what's your mass and fos when diameter of 70mm is used?
UNK_UNK yes. d from 20 to 15
UNK_UNK does increasing D give you better or worse weight
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK I think I've lowered it as much as possible without completely sacrificing FOS
UNK_UNK Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
UNK_UNK 2.77
UNK_UNK he won't respond to me
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
UNK_UNK Hey, what fos, do you think would be good enough, 1.5-2.25 ish?
UNK_UNK Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
UNK_UNK i got barely any points on the third problem
UNK_UNK i will see what i can do
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK alriight
UNK_UNK wait what
UNK_UNK also you can only see a few of the design variables, so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn't as good
UNK_UNK 60 ia the current value
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
UNK_UNK makes sense
UNK_UNK thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length
UNK_UNK Hello, is your FOS above 1.5?
UNK_UNK I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
UNK_UNK that puts my mass at 2.43 and fos at 3.9 with t=10, d=25, and c=70. That's not bad for now
UNK_UNK No idea
UNK_UNK I think flywheel is where our problems are
UNK_UNK Ok, is he working on fixing it?
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get fos to like 0.89
UNK_UNK does that work well for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK Lets decrease mass
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Oh, wow. My FoS is in the 20s, so I can definitely scale back
UNK_UNK What parameters can you change
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK Great - we're getting close.  I'm trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values
UNK_UNK Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
UNK_UNK ms was 2.79
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK i just reduced my mass
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK Whats your lowest mass?
UNK_UNK i have m = 0.07 and fos at 1.23
UNK_UNK I-section thickness and length of connecting rod.
UNK_UNK do you know what's going on?
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK I can increase the FOS, but it almost isn't worth it with how much weight is added on
UNK_UNK and increase FOS a decent amount
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK any updates?
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK check for broadcast?
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK what values are you using for the flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel
UNK_UNK so thats nice
UNK_UNK am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK I don't select any diameter
UNK_UNK Did you make that change?
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Connecting rod says they are at FOS = 2.77
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK for sure. go for it
UNK_UNK i will compile
UNK_UNK let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK now we are at very good
UNK_UNK can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
UNK_UNK piston pin and flywheel are a little quiet and might not be interacting
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK what values are you suggesting?
UNK_UNK end*
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK wait your ds is 15 now?
UNK_UNK No at most ill change it by 10, how much would a diameter of 50 affect your mass and FOS
UNK_UNK I didn;t change
UNK_UNK Only the lowest matters, so there's no need for anything above 2
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK where are you getting that info
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK Our factor of safety is greater than 2, which is excellent 
UNK_UNK thats great, im at 0.1,2.62
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK to give the same factor of saftey and reduced weight
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK right :(
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK Would it be possible for you to increase your fos?
UNK_UNK the highest fos rn for me is 0.89
UNK_UNK whyd we get bumped down
UNK_UNK That effects me as well
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK holy cow someone is making major changes
UNK_UNK okay, so let's try to get a high FS, as flywheel has huge masses, and they well work on mass reduction
UNK_UNK I have FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK we need to work on making the design much lighter though if thats possible with your part
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK looks like mass dropped a lot
UNK_UNK are the other people responding
UNK_UNK its bleow 40 and above 2
UNK_UNK i agree haha
UNK_UNK hahahahaa
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK no idea
UNK_UNK It's down to 3.22 with the current bore diameter
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK update:
UNK_UNK higher tf is better for me
UNK_UNK yeah I think since the piston pin weighs so little, what you have is good
UNK_UNK We're a little above the mass but otherwise good
UNK_UNK what ur fos
UNK_UNK wow english
UNK_UNK nope, haven't broadcasted in a bit. The most I can change the wieght is by like 3 anyways
UNK_UNK X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK End experiment, nice worK!
UNK_UNK Ok. I decreased my weight a little bit
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK oh okay
UNK_UNK Piston diameter and piston head thickness
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK diamater is 90
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK aight did you broadcast anything?
UNK_UNK object? i dont know the options for categories lol
UNK_UNK For lower mass I could make it 40, it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn't affect FOS as much
UNK_UNK and what are your numbers when you do that
UNK_UNK thickness 12 diameter 60
UNK_UNK someones FOS is too low
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
UNK_UNK Same.
UNK_UNK the piston wont respond
UNK_UNK c is bearing support offset
UNK_UNK I'm gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
UNK_UNK no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
UNK_UNK i think ive optimized my part
UNK_UNK 1.36
UNK_UNK Ok, try reducing the diameter to 45 and see what happens
UNK_UNK thinking about changing it to 55
UNK_UNK Interesting, the mass is what is hurting us but the FOS is beautifull
UNK_UNK Hey could I get the value of the piston bore diameter whenever you've got it?
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK I know.
UNK_UNK I've just been clicking refresh for the last 20 minutes haha
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK now its 1.67
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK do you control ds?
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK let me know if you need to go any lower
UNK_UNK currently 1.64
UNK_UNK ya I need the piston to change the bore diameter so I can see how if effects my numbers
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK Good point, 40 is the lower limit
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is.  we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK 55
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK Alright.
UNK_UNK back at80
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK Hey what do you have control over?
UNK_UNK f_os = 9193.31
UNK_UNK right now its 0.1 but it ranges from 0.01 to 0.1
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK whats your mass
UNK_UNK 7.98
UNK_UNK or we were for a second
UNK_UNK I would double my system weight though.
UNK_UNK Way to be on top of things, I won't vote you off the island
UNK_UNK trying to lower mass of 2.43, still using 70
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK whats your weight at?
UNK_UNK whats your fos ?
UNK_UNK what is the mass of your design?
UNK_UNK good working with ya
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Make sure your part's FOS isnt the same as the sub system's. If it is, increase it slightly
UNK_UNK I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually. So we cannot optimize that part.
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department.  Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK diameter is 25 mm
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK its already over 2
UNK_UNK awesome. have you noticed that based on the chart we should be in excellent with our current values?
UNK_UNK what are your ds and tf?
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
UNK_UNK kk
UNK_UNK does your design depend on the flywheel at all?
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK i have 1.7 fos with 58 mass
UNK_UNK If you need to increase up to 42 thats possible
UNK_UNK what diameter should i use. i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of 97.5
UNK_UNK 0.13
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK Are you in charge of determining the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK What's your system mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK Do you have piston bore diameter?(D)
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75to see what happens
UNK_UNK they were the minimum of both
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK What did you choose your diameter to be?
UNK_UNK Have you changed the diameter at all?
UNK_UNK update back to very good
UNK_UNK i only depend on the piston
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK can get 2.62 fos with .01 extra mass
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.27 already
UNK_UNK or crankshaft
UNK_UNK how much mass is your part?
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK I don't think so, maybe try to find an fos closer to 2 and reduce the mass?
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK your FOS is in the thousands????
UNK_UNK Ah okay, gotcha
UNK_UNK tractor king
UNK_UNK I dont think those effect my design. Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Hello piston, based on my information, it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness (tf) and maximize flywheel shaft diameter (ds). Does this work with your design requirements?
UNK_UNK Sweet!
UNK_UNK Yeah I'm talking to the crankshaft
UNK_UNK Minimize mass of connecting rod and maximize factor of safety against yielding due to buckling.
UNK_UNK who went down in weight?
UNK_UNK I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK we havent added it yet
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK also decreases my fos
UNK_UNK mass went up quite a bit on my end
UNK_UNK yup just got that, asked piston to lower his mass. Just to see
UNK_UNK Ok, someone changed something and made it much worse
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK im not sure if everyone is on board.
UNK_UNK piston controls it
UNK_UNK yeah the pin is pretty light, shouldnt be an issue
UNK_UNK Didn't change anything. We need to decrease mass
UNK_UNK yea lets not change any more variables
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK no I dont
UNK_UNK the final isnt cumulative tho
UNK_UNK Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already?
UNK_UNK kk ill test
UNK_UNK Supposedly increasing the offset increases m and decreases f, so lose-lose for me
UNK_UNK Lets not change it now
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK communication is key my brotha
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you. That is the highest FOS I have found
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Do you need to know what the thickness of I-section or Conrod length is because I am in charge of choosing those variables?
UNK_UNK what is the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK the new one is 45 as of now
UNK_UNK Mine's still 2.95
UNK_UNK Our FOS dipped again
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK what values do you have control over?
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS
UNK_UNK im not sure yet
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK increase in either variable causes both the mass and FOS to go up
UNK_UNK My piston mass is 0.52 and FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK What's the FOS of your current selection? I'm trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over FOS
UNK_UNK I'm at lowest mass for 55 bore diameter. I can step down to 47.5 bore diameter and that might help
UNK_UNK mine says Very Good
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK It still says .51 and he said that was for the team and that I couldn't see my own. I don't know if that makes sense though??
UNK_UNK flywheel
UNK_UNK With my current design, mass is 0.52 and Fs is 2.0
UNK_UNK Its the lowest mass with an FOS above 2
UNK_UNK Try for a FOS of 2 with minimum mass
UNK_UNK X|X|O
UNK_UNK at this point, just piston diameter
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, just need to reduce the mass
UNK_UNK so it looks like my max FOS is 1.23 with 47
UNK_UNK Sick, our engine is now excellent
UNK_UNK it costs money
UNK_UNK crankshaft offset
UNK_UNK Not yet
UNK_UNK mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
UNK_UNK then we can ask someone to decrease mass
UNK_UNK increase* sorry
UNK_UNK yeah it sucked
UNK_UNK no we need mass below 35
UNK_UNK crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
UNK_UNK I mean something changed and made it go back down to very good, but I didn't change anything, did you?
UNK_UNK and D = 85
UNK_UNK we can both move. i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK my current c i 150 and dc of 30
UNK_UNK at bore diameter of 40
UNK_UNK And also the fos?
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK what fos #s are you getting?
UNK_UNK 100 as initial experiment
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK and thickness
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK A bit. I can lower bore diameter
UNK_UNK *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
UNK_UNK the closest FOS I have above 2 is 3.78. I'll try broadcasting it
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK yeah, I see the change now
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you!
UNK_UNK nevermind just updated broadcast
UNK_UNK pretty sure no one
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK What is your mass?
UNK_UNK why isnt this exxcellent
UNK_UNK The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass
UNK_UNK any changes?
UNK_UNK FOS 2.06
UNK_UNK I just got my FOS up to 9
UNK_UNK ok i did
UNK_UNK How are we looking with FS?
UNK_UNK Mine is at 2.36
UNK_UNK i updated
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK m_s : 1.46;   fos_s : 1.32;
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK 80 as the current design
UNK_UNK Did your values just change?
UNK_UNK What value would be ideal for the flywheel?
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK right now
UNK_UNK 12 and 60
UNK_UNK Fos could increase with increase in mass but if it's already so high I don't think it matters, right?
UNK_UNK yeah right now i have a piston diameter of 90 and head thickness of 7.25
UNK_UNK Hey whats the Fs for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find out what everyone's FS is. crankshafter has theirs at 3.62
UNK_UNK i did it.  Looks a little closer but not quite there
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK 82.5 actually
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK 40 inches.
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK Yeah I was about to ask that and i think you are right
UNK_UNK Weigght!
UNK_UNK actually
UNK_UNK these are the same values for the "very good" design
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK we need less mass folks
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK the mass shot up
UNK_UNK .06 and 2.62
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
UNK_UNK if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
UNK_UNK did any mass values change?
UNK_UNK for my subsystem?
UNK_UNK nice. So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK also how much does bore diameter effect you? If i go down to the lowest bore diameter I can increase FOS a bit
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK I'm not sure what happened, but if you need me to change anything, let me know. From here all I can do is increase FOS and mass, but we don't need that
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK who are you working with?
UNK_UNK what is your mass
UNK_UNK lower bore diameter? on it. I'll go down to 55 and see what we can get
UNK_UNK D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
UNK_UNK but were at v good
UNK_UNK Hello, I am currently trying to solve for the piston-pin length, and I need the piston bore diameter (D). Do you happen to have this value?
UNK_UNK Got it
UNK_UNK Im working on the connecting rod. Honestly just trying to figure out how to start
UNK_UNK What about you?
UNK_UNK We were at exceelent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK no i do not. i am compiling everyones
UNK_UNK Lower D works better for both me and the rod designer, do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK No only the inner piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK so ds doesn't make a difference for my fos
UNK_UNK I can try and trim a little more tho]
UNK_UNK i need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK the broadcast still shows 40
UNK_UNK I double checked the handout and yeah, it's only dependent on lower FOS
UNK_UNK we need FOS up a bit more now overall
UNK_UNK also broadcast those, I am not using your variables others might
UNK_UNK I'll try
UNK_UNK piston is0.91
UNK_UNK and yes I'm broadcasting that
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK No i think its fine i was just curious
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK what FS are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK Right now I am at 90. Would you want me to increase or decrease that?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK 0.1
UNK_UNK My parameters are thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter. If you feel this directly applies to your design let me know!
UNK_UNK let's not change it
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK ok dont do that
UNK_UNK Are you chnaging anything?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK _I_I_
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK I didn't, and neither did crankshaft. I think flywheel did
UNK_UNK I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the FS, I can make my part heavier
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK Okay we are good now
UNK_UNK 3.2, but that's about to decrease since my mass is way too high
UNK_UNK I set t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4, and the quality turns out to be excellent
UNK_UNK So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably
UNK_UNK try changing your other values?
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK Can you broadcast a design with c as 130?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK indeed
UNK_UNK bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK ans 0.63 mass
UNK_UNK _I_IO
UNK_UNK are you still using 40 for the diameter?
UNK_UNK the dream team
UNK_UNK Yeah they said they're not going to change it now
UNK_UNK hmm ok I'll check around
UNK_UNK Will experiment
UNK_UNK idk
UNK_UNK Do you need any information from me?
UNK_UNK yeah me too
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase?
UNK_UNK got em
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK you have o maximise c right?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK yes, the minimum is 700 haha
UNK_UNK So we are in good range right now
UNK_UNK how about you?
UNK_UNK yeah 0.09 isnt hot
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK can you please share your variables with just the letters
UNK_UNK aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click "check for broadcast"
UNK_UNK and I have no variables controlled by others
UNK_UNK The value I'm at now is the lowest it can be without going below 1.5. As the crank lenght is changed, my values change though
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK it was excelent, someone messed it up
UNK_UNK Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK what do you control!
UNK_UNK how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK great question, but it is all legitimate
UNK_UNK there
UNK_UNK Are they related? There is nothing in my design to indicate that they are
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK I think we're .1 over now. Best options I have to increase FOS would also lead to lowering bore diameter. IDK how that effects you
UNK_UNK 40~70
UNK_UNK Can you lower your diameter a touch? My options depend only on that.
UNK_UNK "however D will need to increase to compensate for the reduced FOS"
UNK_UNK What factors are you interested in?
UNK_UNK what's your mass and FOS
UNK_UNK for fos
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK fos went up to 2.22 and mass went up to 37.56 from 35. something
UNK_UNK bearing support offest
UNK_UNK 1.12
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK If that reduces your fos
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK thats a double negative then right. Can you see the power components. I know we have to satisfy minimums for some specs
UNK_UNK i can go lower but it'ss reduce fos
UNK_UNK It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I'm doing something wrong
UNK_UNK The fos range for others is between 2.5 and 4.09
UNK_UNK no, i got my best value now
UNK_UNK The crankshaft designed is changing values
UNK_UNK I control D somewhere in 90
UNK_UNK i think this is a trap
UNK_UNK D = 80 not 90
UNK_UNK yo the far right column, should we just pick the one with the lowest ms and highest fos
UNK_UNK so all the values you get are assuming max piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Must be
UNK_UNK what is your fos rn?
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK i'm focusing on minimizing thickness primarily
UNK_UNK okay. I think the value is not this.
UNK_UNK piston is 0.83
UNK_UNK What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK ok so id say you worry more about low mass with D and I can worry more about high FOS with ds
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
UNK_UNK ta said we're good
UNK_UNK no my mass is 3.05 and my FOS is 2.02
UNK_UNK I think the rest of us are right around 2.0
UNK_UNK I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK I will be using 40mm going forward
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK I can get mine up to 3.44 max where D = 40
UNK_UNK 51 and 1.1
UNK_UNK should we end?
UNK_UNK thickness is at lowest
UNK_UNK Did you change your broadcast?
UNK_UNK is there any way you can change your numbers to increase fos while keeping mass similar
UNK_UNK I'm seeing 1.75
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK ok.
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK we only need it to be above 2
UNK_UNK even in the case by case basis, the higher the FOS the better
UNK_UNK hey try changing the diameter to 90
UNK_UNK and your mass?
UNK_UNK but imma find em
UNK_UNK What value are you using for your piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK did you just change something?
UNK_UNK mine still says fair
UNK_UNK *we only need to decrease mass now
UNK_UNK I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the FS, I can make my part heavier
UNK_UNK fos went from 3.18 to 2.95 and mass from 0.13 to 0.11
UNK_UNK okay one sec
UNK_UNK Yeah I think that's the best we can get
UNK_UNK ill check
UNK_UNK Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past 1.23 FOS
UNK_UNK ok sounds good
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
UNK_UNK Im sticking with that
UNK_UNK ok youre the minimum
UNK_UNK this is as good as i can get
UNK_UNK mine has been constant from last change
UNK_UNK quality just went down to poor for me. seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything?
UNK_UNK ya go ahead and change it back, can you lower D any more?
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK I have control over D
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK I think my d_c makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK okay, you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger
UNK_UNK piston-pin is not responding
UNK_UNK What's your FOS given the crankshaft bearing offset that the crankshaft has?
UNK_UNK crankshaft has a mass of 28
UNK_UNK any suggestions?
UNK_UNK I'll prioritize on increasing FS
UNK_UNK what is the range of values you can choose?
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK i drop to .97 FS
UNK_UNK i broadcasted my best
UNK_UNK Currently 3.2
UNK_UNK yeah thats weird
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK are you still using D = 40?
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK If I drop my weight way down though my fos is super trash
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK Wanna call it?
UNK_UNK do you think I should try and increase those?
UNK_UNK mass is currently 1.53 and FOS 2.01
UNK_UNK hey
UNK_UNK Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
UNK_UNK I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod?
UNK_UNK that's better than poor
UNK_UNK did you change anything?
UNK_UNK awesome job
UNK_UNK rad
UNK_UNK what's your factor of safety currently
UNK_UNK what are your current values for mass and fos?
UNK_UNK Around 2 would be ideal
UNK_UNK but that might change the system actually
UNK_UNK my FOS is best at 40, making it larger decreases my FOS
UNK_UNK We need to work on FS. Is it just an average of all the factor of safetys?
UNK_UNK you should probably ask him/her
UNK_UNK 1.23 is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter
UNK_UNK what shaft diameter are you using
UNK_UNK Aim for FOS to be above 2 while minimizing mass
UNK_UNK Well it's between 40 and 70 so maybe like 55 to start? I'll run some simulations
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK the thickness(t_I) ranges from 5 to 15 mm, and ratio(r1) ranges from 5 to 5
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK Did
UNK_UNK FS is currently 1.23
UNK_UNK okay, stay at that point
UNK_UNK my foss is 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
UNK_UNK but we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
UNK_UNK What is your current mass at?
UNK_UNK yo
UNK_UNK ok, i m gonna try different thckness of I section on the rod as well as the conrod length
UNK_UNK My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
UNK_UNK check out my latest broadcast, that looks like the best I can do
UNK_UNK What does your system FS value say? mine are all like over 4000 even when i minimize mass
UNK_UNK for c
UNK_UNK i changed the mass from 50 to 30
UNK_UNK No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK also what are your ds and tf values
UNK_UNK Yeah I noticed the same thing
UNK_UNK 2 is for expecially good design
UNK_UNK maybe we need to be secret
UNK_UNK What is your piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK Okay, thank you
UNK_UNK I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
UNK_UNK I'm jumping between (0.7,0.7) and (0.7,0.8) for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass
UNK_UNK thickness = 8
UNK_UNK Right. Got mine to mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK diameter is 90
UNK_UNK can you share all your variables
UNK_UNK Rod designer still here
UNK_UNK crankshaft hit the wrong button that is why i think it went back to poor
UNK_UNK We need FS to increase now
UNK_UNK let me know if you change it at all
UNK_UNK can you trim a tiny bit more?
UNK_UNK btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
UNK_UNK You could reduce the FOS value since they are looking for the component with the smallest FOS value
UNK_UNK we need mass down a bit
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK But I haven't changed anything and it went down.
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK can you reduce mass but keep FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK 1.8 to 4.72, I'm currently at 2.14 but can drop to 1.96 without loosing too much fos
UNK_UNK D = 90 for now
UNK_UNK my mass = 6. im guessing connecting rod?
UNK_UNK yo
UNK_UNK i think i changed it to excellent
UNK_UNK bets on who goes rogue
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK lets play tic tac toe (give me a sec)
UNK_UNK what values are you using for the input poston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK yeah exactly
UNK_UNK 27.44
UNK_UNK try to decrease mass while keeping FOS over 2
UNK_UNK at the top it says round 2
UNK_UNK smallest
UNK_UNK but 90 is best for us
UNK_UNK yeahh idk where they r at
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK piston told me, crankshaft want him to have miximum diameter
UNK_UNK no, i mean 6.72
UNK_UNK I have, at least on my screen.
UNK_UNK These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different D: 75: 5.45, 85: 6.72, 95: 8.08, 105: 9.56. These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different diameters
UNK_UNK what is your piston bore diameter? 40?
UNK_UNK sweet we just need to get mass down
UNK_UNK no one depends on mine either
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK LOL NO
UNK_UNK I think it could be a little lower since a factor of safety above 2 is considered excellent
UNK_UNK ranges from0.45 to 4.43
UNK_UNK yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
UNK_UNK i used 40mm
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK We are good on mass
UNK_UNK excellent
UNK_UNK Good
UNK_UNK Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design.
UNK_UNK but you can't change that right?
UNK_UNK For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
UNK_UNK Is there a tf that works best for you?
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK ok so if you increase C my fos goes down but weight is not effected
UNK_UNK thats good
UNK_UNK it doesnt impact it much, and my part is low mass so if i have to change it, that wont be a big deal
UNK_UNK 2.11. I can't really descrease is. my dimensions are at their max/min
UNK_UNK Ive changed it and I can sway the overall by roughly 0.1 by adding 0.03 mass
UNK_UNK it says very good
UNK_UNK c was changed to 80
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK waaaaait my bad
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK ms=0.52 fos=1215
UNK_UNK Currently I think the mass is too much.
UNK_UNK The crankshaft by far has the most mass
UNK_UNK I am doing that now. Thanks for the help!
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
UNK_UNK still fos of over 1000
UNK_UNK You good to leave
UNK_UNK but no one changed anything i believe
UNK_UNK minimum mass that has FOS > 2
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK I just bumped mine up
UNK_UNK Do you know if theres a specific way all our parts work together? I can change mass and FS of my part but depending on like my offset do other parts need to be a certain dimension?
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos when you maximize both your design variables
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
UNK_UNK *your
UNK_UNK It does not affect my part
UNK_UNK No i do not!
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK D, d_s, and t_f, but I don't know how to use those
UNK_UNK yes, 40
UNK_UNK Im sticking to a small mass bc right now we are heavier than allowed
UNK_UNK now the whole part is 3.86
UNK_UNK Our FOS was at like 2.5 and mass was at 44. Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton.
UNK_UNK whats the name of the diameter?
UNK_UNK try reducing C?
UNK_UNK what changed>
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting that?
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK I think the 82.5 is the best. let me know when you are okay for me to change it back.
UNK_UNK the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK mass,fos
UNK_UNK alright, let me find my  ideal values based on the 40
UNK_UNK is that a typo?
UNK_UNK its too low to have the impact it is having
UNK_UNK X X O ; O O X ; X O O
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK rn i have a 90 mm diameter
UNK_UNK I just saved mass changing tf to 30
UNK_UNK have you changed the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK im using a 40
UNK_UNK ahh, its changed for me
UNK_UNK your variables affect the other measurements
UNK_UNK well the grade scale shows that a total mass below 2 should be possible
UNK_UNK I think tyhe 47.5 produced better results
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK what you need and what you have
UNK_UNK you too!
UNK_UNK or maybe 80
UNK_UNK Actually we're only at 2.84
UNK_UNK piston
UNK_UNK Would increasing or decreasing ds lower the weight?
UNK_UNK 0.11
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK Yeah for a second we were meeting both...I wonder what just updated?
UNK_UNK Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin?
UNK_UNK My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
UNK_UNK and i think D
UNK_UNK i have been
UNK_UNK you could try increasing D a little and see what happens overall
UNK_UNK whats your mass at? and can it be lowered
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK Can you do D =85?
UNK_UNK flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK I'm not sure why they aren't updating though when I change my input values
UNK_UNK t = 5.7, r1 = 4
UNK_UNK sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter, connecting rod thickness, and connecting rod length ratio
UNK_UNK My fs is 2.27 and mass is 19.96
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK 4.55 which is my highest
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK Sorry, what is your current length
UNK_UNK i havent changed anything
UNK_UNK yeahh i think thats what happened to most people
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK ok we are good
UNK_UNK I'm looking for the lowest mass with highest fos right now
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK i increased the diameter to improve the factor of safety, I can reduce it if we want to try it out
UNK_UNK ok and which do you depend on
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK yeah one sec
UNK_UNK 0.02-0.12
UNK_UNK Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass = 0.12 and FOS = 3.44
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
UNK_UNK 40 mm works fine for me. Fs of 4.71 and mass of 0.76. I will continue to iterate.
UNK_UNK I'd like to keep it at 47 since that help connecting rod
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK it was 2.79 then made a couple changes and now it 1.25
UNK_UNK I can only do 60-130
UNK_UNK but ive decided im gonna focus more on 352 bc its a heavier weighted class
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK Whats the best you can get with a bore diameter of 80?
UNK_UNK so are we just done then? lol
UNK_UNK whats your fos  ?
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
UNK_UNK just above 2
UNK_UNK I have found a piston bore diameter of around 90 to be best for me
UNK_UNK right now we need to focus on mass
UNK_UNK think low fos is from piston pin
UNK_UNK my bad, thanks 
UNK_UNK cool. I'll let everyone else know
UNK_UNK My mass is 0.87
UNK_UNK we can see how good his/her part is with 45 and increase if necessary
UNK_UNK The global variables are giving our current FOS is 0.57 so I think we need to maximize that
UNK_UNK Ok my fos is 2.03 with m - 0.05
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK 1.2
UNK_UNK i have mass 1.27, FOS: 15886
UNK_UNK is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
UNK_UNK Yeah we were at excellent but we've gone back down to poor now somehow
UNK_UNK okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
UNK_UNK I lowered the r values. It did lower the weight, but the FOS is too low now
UNK_UNK is there any way you can make our fos increase
UNK_UNK 44, 1.29
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK sorry left my caps on
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK Hello, Do you need any parameters from me? 
UNK_UNK ours just does donuts as of rn
UNK_UNK sorry 50 mm
UNK_UNK current mass is 0.01 with fos 0.1
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK do you depend on t1 or r1?
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK What are your settings now?
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK flywheel - update the group when you change!
UNK_UNK Mine range from 1.5 to 65.
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK whats dc
UNK_UNK Alright thanks
UNK_UNK 2.83
UNK_UNK Yeah, FOS hasn't been an issue for me, it's just mass is way too high
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK is it possible for that to go lower
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK Lets try and get back to where Fair was, that seemed like the right track 
UNK_UNK or avg
UNK_UNK I think the lowest fos is what is broadcasted
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK I believe FOS of 2.31
UNK_UNK can you reduce is closer to 2 while decreasing mass?
UNK_UNK oh true
UNK_UNK and see
UNK_UNK good job team
UNK_UNK hows it going?
UNK_UNK Is there any information I could give you that could help your design?
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK awesome, i think this will help. Should I go to my lowest setting or no? Im on my second to lowest setting right now
UNK_UNK Im at 0.1 rn with a fos of 2.52
UNK_UNK Don't use a FOS of higher than like 5
UNK_UNK dont change anything
UNK_UNK I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality
UNK_UNK no way
UNK_UNK q5: is it a windshield wiper
UNK_UNK can you try the one thats closes to 2?
UNK_UNK though I might switch to 75
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK I have an fos of 1.45 now, I'll try increasing the diameter
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK Ok, I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK what are the values you put
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK ok thx
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK crankshaft is 1.93
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK Nope, mass = 1.27, fos_s=13238
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK ok I have mass: 3.05, FOS 2.02
UNK_UNK my weight is minimized completely fos = 1212
UNK_UNK go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK IT HAS US AT EXCELLENT NOW
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK I see
UNK_UNK was it D=75 that was giving us that low weight?
UNK_UNK 1.62 kg
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK its up to 1.7 now so getting there
UNK_UNK Crankshaft bearing offset? I don't control that variable!
UNK_UNK what parameters do you have?
UNK_UNK Are you referring to  the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK 1.35 i mean
UNK_UNK what is the range for your mass values?
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK 0.24
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK so for flywheel reasonable mass and best FOS is giving thickness of 12
UNK_UNK Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by .15 while also increasing fos by .65
UNK_UNK Thats great, any way you can reduce weight more then?
UNK_UNK Do you need any dimensions from me?
UNK_UNK aight
UNK_UNK thanks!
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK I'm ending it
UNK_UNK Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness, piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK i am maxed out i think
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK No idea
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop mass more
UNK_UNK broadcasting 2.85 with a mass of 1.36
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK we are at excellent now
UNK_UNK my mass is 3.57
UNK_UNK ok i get fos of 5 and ms of 7
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK I'm working with Piston to improve my FOS
UNK_UNK can you change yours? Piston and flywheel just changed theres
UNK_UNK 0.11
UNK_UNK I can decrease my mass by .19kg but that brings my FoS down 1.49
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK also piston guy is using D=40
UNK_UNK thats an L
UNK_UNK okay, what's your weight?
UNK_UNK wasnt me
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK 2.95 is my minimum, I can't go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK alright, guess not then
UNK_UNK Not moving even a bit :')
UNK_UNK everyone else has remained the same values
UNK_UNK Makes sense, but when I improve mine the overall systems decreases.
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK i brought it down
UNK_UNK I changed fos but not the diamter
UNK_UNK does yours say that too?
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK how much mass is your part?
UNK_UNK we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
UNK_UNK ok who will my t_h or piston head thickness affect?
UNK_UNK Not from what I understand
UNK_UNK 80mm
UNK_UNK r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
UNK_UNK The piston pin is pretty important though so id say maximize mass for fos if you can
UNK_UNK to 150
UNK_UNK Do you have an option of an FOS of at least 1?
UNK_UNK what fos are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK ayyyyyy
UNK_UNK How's the effect of the diameter on mass?
UNK_UNK my connecting rod length = 1/(crank length)
UNK_UNK ah okk
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK No, I have two of my own variables
UNK_UNK no just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK Hell to the yeah
UNK_UNK Awesome. Thanks
UNK_UNK whats the max diamter
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 12
UNK_UNK m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK my part maintains FOS=2.06
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK lol
UNK_UNK I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
UNK_UNK Try and decrease C so that we increase the factor of safety
UNK_UNK Are we good to end?
UNK_UNK nah dont do that
UNK_UNK more mass
UNK_UNK mine is 0.1 so idk why our mass is so high
UNK_UNK Yea I believe so.
UNK_UNK ok that was what I was seeing as well
UNK_UNK im at 2.07
UNK_UNK Not for a little bit. did something change for you?
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Mine is at 4.55
UNK_UNK 27.44
UNK_UNK I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
UNK_UNK Nevermind
UNK_UNK did you change something after excellent
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK it needs to be just above 2
UNK_UNK Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
UNK_UNK I also have that dimension
UNK_UNK no worries
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK The input crank-shaft bearing support offset
UNK_UNK 7.02
UNK_UNK I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the FOS
UNK_UNK can you change it to 150?
UNK_UNK Ok.
UNK_UNK i didnt move
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK What requirements do you have on the Piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an FOS of over 2 that chould do it
UNK_UNK rying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
UNK_UNK Is 75 still the number youre going with
UNK_UNK lets get this bread
UNK_UNK since if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest
UNK_UNK whats your fos?
UNK_UNK nah, I assume you're talking about the piston bore diameter right?
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized rn
UNK_UNK as long as you dont dramatically decrease your Fs because i think most oif it is coming from you
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK Don't change anything!
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK He wont respond lol
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK fair, that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase FOS, I'll decrease mass
UNK_UNK yeah im at what i think is the best spot too
UNK_UNK yes. I can get up to a FOS of 3 at 45 but only 1.23 at 47.5
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK Agreed. 3.05
UNK_UNK let me change around and see what i got
UNK_UNK I cannot bring that down too much farther as Fs is at 2.1
UNK_UNK Nice!
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK My design includes r2 and r3, do those affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK nah its above 35
UNK_UNK Im using .8 and .55 for r2 and r3
UNK_UNK Ok, trying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK mines at 2.27
UNK_UNK I do not
UNK_UNK nvm looks good
UNK_UNK Will make it larger only if you need
UNK_UNK We are GOOD
UNK_UNK so C low?
UNK_UNK its 80 rn
UNK_UNK or like a mix since both my variable are pretty influential
UNK_UNK Yea I don't think so either.
UNK_UNK Right now I am using 5mm
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK I am done
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK can you try increasing ds?
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK however i can bring it all the way down to 40 and still have a fos of 2.7
UNK_UNK My individual mass is 1.27
UNK_UNK idk what im doing at the moment
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK As of right now, I'm comfortable around 85 for my diameter, but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass
UNK_UNK _IXIX
UNK_UNK I'll try it
UNK_UNK Check for broadcast now
UNK_UNK All my sims seem to have it at 40 rn
UNK_UNK who is this?!
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Good point, I could reduce my mass by .15 and the part will still be plenty strong
UNK_UNK yeah sounds good
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness
UNK_UNK 150 is the lower bound...
UNK_UNK or she
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK retweet
UNK_UNK It might be the flywheel or crankshaft folks
UNK_UNK Do it. I think you have the most influence over FOS. Piston pin guy can only go to a max of 1.23 FOS, rod designer has a current FOS of 11.3, crankshaft FOS is 1.11, and mine is 7.37
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Its now at 82.5
UNK_UNK Just did
UNK_UNK No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK we need to lower our mass
UNK_UNK I have it low as possible
UNK_UNK That's pretty minimal
UNK_UNK Yes, that is when I used piston bore diameter of 105
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK masses in the hundreths
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK i wont move mine again
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK i see mine hadnt updated yet
UNK_UNK Nevermind, global changed to 55.36 and 2.03
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK can you raise fos still?
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK ill go with a ratio of 4 so 900 for connector length
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK i do not
UNK_UNK So I think for 40 mm is good for now
UNK_UNK do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters?
UNK_UNK don't change for sometine
UNK_UNK can you try decreasing your mass?
UNK_UNK what variables do you depend on
UNK_UNK what is your pin diameter?
UNK_UNK 0.28
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK whats the range of mass you have?
UNK_UNK For the one I just ran I got 2.62
UNK_UNK how
UNK_UNK Currently the size is 40
UNK_UNK Based on their mass of 1.66, they take up half the weight of the system. So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important.
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK and go max
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
UNK_UNK or reduced offset i should say
UNK_UNK *tho
UNK_UNK What's the updated mass for the crankshaft?
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting your latest values? and your FOS is above 2 right?
UNK_UNK whats the lightest you can go with fs > 2
UNK_UNK we can make some spare weight elsewhere
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm upto 2.62 now. But remember, its the minimum of all the FOS that matters the most.
UNK_UNK if you read design variables section on the sheet
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK What's your current FOS?
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages.
UNK_UNK what's the projected mass and fos for your chosen part?
UNK_UNK Do all of us just ahve a control with a mass and FS?
UNK_UNK no i don't think so
UNK_UNK Our FOS is going up and mass is going down, but we still need both to change
UNK_UNK Do you know who controls those factors?
UNK_UNK nope you're good
UNK_UNK woo!
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK If I do the lowest mass I can then FOS goes down by a lot
UNK_UNK connect 4
UNK_UNK yuppppp
UNK_UNK Oh no
UNK_UNK I don't think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from 40 to 70
UNK_UNK yeah min is 2.77
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK poor of me to assume
UNK_UNK that wasn't me/ I am trying to shave off that little bit
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK no nothing affects me
UNK_UNK Let me decrease my thickness a bit
UNK_UNK Perfect
UNK_UNK we are tryin to cut down on mass right now
UNK_UNK I change it back to 80 since the overall results for 75 are not good
UNK_UNK i think the other designers are gridlocked as far as influencing the factor of safetuy
UNK_UNK Diameter = 40mm
UNK_UNK if you increase though that increases mass
UNK_UNK with my current dimensions mass is 1.2 and FOS is 15886.04
UNK_UNK Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
UNK_UNK helloooo
UNK_UNK you have one that works well for you?
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK What's your system FOS?
UNK_UNK Just did
UNK_UNK these are the same values I had for the "very good" design
UNK_UNK Are you still at 160 for support offset?
UNK_UNK Thickness and rod length to crank length ratio
UNK_UNK bore diameter
UNK_UNK It looks a little better now
UNK_UNK im not changing anything...
UNK_UNK did you get FOS as 1.81?
UNK_UNK !
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset (c)
UNK_UNK K. I'm at 4
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK I think you could decrease mass bc FOS only needs to be above 2
UNK_UNK I could, but in reality the goal is 2.0. I could only go upto 3.44, but it would appear that the FOS issue isn't on my end.
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK all good
UNK_UNK were at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting new values?
UNK_UNK 2.04, no bene
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK cool we should be good then
UNK_UNK I Have. Since my part is probably the lightest, I increased my fs
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK increasing D increases my fos
UNK_UNK we did hit both requirements at one point
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK I have 3.03 with mass of 0.12.
UNK_UNK refresh it
UNK_UNK ask
UNK_UNK require: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK okay sounds goof
UNK_UNK 150mm
UNK_UNK Lets see what happens?
UNK_UNK yeah, working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass
UNK_UNK is 60 the minimum you can go with the crankshaft
UNK_UNK Right now I have it broadcasted at 55
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK Okay, so your FS are in a slightly higher order
UNK_UNK Yea, just a slight chance to fail
UNK_UNK What external variables affect your design?
UNK_UNK we are at excellent
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK Crankshaft asked for bore diameter. Thats all
UNK_UNK what about you?
UNK_UNK oh the round number is the simulation number
UNK_UNK yes, they are active
UNK_UNK Also lol looking back at my simulations, minimizing D actually increases my mass
UNK_UNK I was asked to keep my parameters constant
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?\
UNK_UNK bueno
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK Or rather, what affects it
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK keep it up and we'll trim from there
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK So I'm trying to pick values of D and tH that will minimize m and maximize FOS, but I know D also interacts with Force
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK Just did. I think that made it heavier
UNK_UNK Hello, what is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK I think the previous dimensions had us at a "very good"
UNK_UNK That sounds ideal to me
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by 0.25
UNK_UNK oh wow haha okay
UNK_UNK we have time
UNK_UNK Awesome same here
UNK_UNK ill try cut a bit of weight with ds
UNK_UNK X X O ; O O X ; X O _
UNK_UNK Did you just change something?
UNK_UNK Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK Mass is now 0.1
UNK_UNK oh damn mine is 0~0.06 when i put diameter as 50
UNK_UNK yes and I am also playing with my numbers because I just realized now what to do. I am still getting poor quality though
UNK_UNK I put mine to initial values and the FOS is good now
UNK_UNK what numbers are u running
UNK_UNK ok my weight goes up a lot with increase c and reduced fos
UNK_UNK mine shows poor
UNK_UNK Are you in charge of choosing the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Higher offset lowers my fos a lot just fyi
UNK_UNK Hey, just want to make sure that the bearing offset is still 70 mm
UNK_UNK we had excelent at one point
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK I spent a lot of time staring at it questioning my basic knowledge of engineering so I'd recommend starting haha
UNK_UNK we still need to reduce mass by a lot
UNK_UNK The crankshaft changed something
UNK_UNK Havent heard back from piston though
UNK_UNK someone is changing stuff
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK not yet, might change to thickness 12 diameter 40 because my FOS is huge
UNK_UNK oh
UNK_UNK even with max c i still have fos = 300
UNK_UNK we got it
UNK_UNK Can you decrease c to 60 and see what you get?
UNK_UNK what's your current bore diameter
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK and mass?
UNK_UNK We are going back up...
UNK_UNK do you rely on a c or a dc?
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK They just told me their FOS is very high
UNK_UNK 2.06
UNK_UNK it is yeah
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK I don't know how to find that info
UNK_UNK exellent dont toucu
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK Not sure. I didn't change anything. I let all the others know
UNK_UNK im just trying to max FOS but your piston wont affect my flywheel
UNK_UNK what values work best for you
UNK_UNK Hello, I do not
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK 1.35
UNK_UNK they responded
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK What parameter do you control?
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK i guess it's good
UNK_UNK wait can you explain again
UNK_UNK i just rebroadcasted
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK Hey!
UNK_UNK Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK Im at 2nd lowest mass
UNK_UNK what do you mean its .51
UNK_UNK so that makes it 600 for connector lenght
UNK_UNK How does changing D affect your FOS?
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK I adjusted my numbers, mass is now 0.16 fos is 4.66
UNK_UNK ill choose a word
UNK_UNK No, it should still be at 40mm
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK Is that value working for you or would it work better if D was larger
UNK_UNK good point
UNK_UNK Yeah I just saw that. and our weight is massive
UNK_UNK just did. .03kg
UNK_UNK dont we just need above 2 though?
UNK_UNK i know, if this were Hell's Kitchen I'd get gordon ramsay to yell at him lol
UNK_UNK our quality just went way down, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK bark
UNK_UNK yeahh i realized that when she got up
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK rightt
UNK_UNK Okay, I think I have control of L and r.
UNK_UNK try not to change anything until you talk to someone
UNK_UNK one second
UNK_UNK yo, what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK Increase your mass slightly
UNK_UNK ms: 1.71, fos: 4.55
UNK_UNK it would increase my fos some
UNK_UNK okay thats better
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK It is
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK what are you FS/Ms at rn?
UNK_UNK i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
UNK_UNK what about you?
UNK_UNK are you changing the variables?
UNK_UNK no mine is 2.0
UNK_UNK yeah that's what I thought
UNK_UNK What are yours?
UNK_UNK currenty 2.03, but that can be raised.
UNK_UNK What varibales do you need to consider?
UNK_UNK I just broadcasted 10, 15, and 60
UNK_UNK my graphs don't show up so i'm somewhat limited
UNK_UNK I control tH and D of the piston
UNK_UNK jk u did
UNK_UNK from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK perfect. thank you
UNK_UNK ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
UNK_UNK Yeah that's what I've found too
UNK_UNK how much does the fly wheel weigh?
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK my current value is c = 150 and dc = 45
UNK_UNK we need to do better though lol
UNK_UNK Don't know if this matters to you, but the connecting rod I section is 2 mm and the ratio of length between the connecting rod and crank length is 3
UNK_UNK Yes but that will also reduce fos and I am the lowest at 1.45 rn
UNK_UNK if you lower D I can raise the FOS with ds
UNK_UNK and fos?
UNK_UNK let me know what the new diameter is
UNK_UNK Yeah I agree. I'll see what they can do
UNK_UNK Do you need to know what the thickness of I-section or Conrod length is because I am in charge of choosing those variables?
UNK_UNK m= 3.46 fos=0.3
UNK_UNK mass is 36.43kg
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK LOWER YOUR FOS
UNK_UNK ok change it to 84 and see what happens
UNK_UNK As long as your fos is above 2, try to find the lowest possible mass
UNK_UNK hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by .28
UNK_UNK anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the FOS too much?
UNK_UNK Are you changing your broadcast values a lot
UNK_UNK yes sir (or maam)
UNK_UNK Flywheel would be the heaviest part
UNK_UNK I could try
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK if i go for a lower mass we don't pass the fos
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK 11.09
UNK_UNK piston pin affects fos most but can't trim much weight
UNK_UNK It increases the mass a lot
UNK_UNK check for a broadcast maybe?
UNK_UNK got it, thanks
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK I just dont know why our FS is so low
UNK_UNK Yeah I've taken that as low as possible without completely ruining fos, we also need to raise that
UNK_UNK What is the bearing support offset you are using?
UNK_UNK a little someone else is messing around with their fos
UNK_UNK 12 for tf and 60 for ds
UNK_UNK You're pretty solid
UNK_UNK yup. will do ;(
UNK_UNK so lower piston diamter lowers your fos?
UNK_UNK k, maybe not then
UNK_UNK MASS: 25.95, FOS 2.27
UNK_UNK piston bore diameter affects both crankshaft and conrods' variables
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK not for me, on mine it says fair
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK im assuming these are horizontal
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK The mass is our biggest issue
UNK_UNK I may change it back to 55 though if that works with yours.
UNK_UNK .05 for mass
UNK_UNK 3.91FOs 5.2m
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK no I got my best value
UNK_UNK 0.52
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK we need it to be higher than 2
UNK_UNK but you might have to reduce mass
UNK_UNK did you change?
UNK_UNK Ok that doesn't affect mine
UNK_UNK it was onlt for a sec
UNK_UNK Ok, seems like 85 is good for D then
UNK_UNK Yea flywheel is the problem
UNK_UNK But it's back to poor now again
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK possibly (as in yes)
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK i got it from crankshaft
UNK_UNK *and gets called out for it*
UNK_UNK 3.64
UNK_UNK Okay. great
UNK_UNK Hello, what is the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK So you want me to increase diameter?
UNK_UNK mine is at the highest possible value
UNK_UNK Oops, my thickness is 10 mm
UNK_UNK has the bore diameter updated?
UNK_UNK did your mass just change a ton
UNK_UNK Increasing C only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start. Do you need it bigger>
UNK_UNK i dont think i have that as an input. Unless im missing something.
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK Just D
UNK_UNK done!
UNK_UNK FS is good just decrease mass
UNK_UNK hey the flywheel guy needs some info from you
UNK_UNK okay we got excellent. we should be done here
UNK_UNK okay now we're better lol - idk what happened
UNK_UNK i might be heavy but i can only do down in mass slightly
UNK_UNK There?
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK do you have any variable that seems to match with those?
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Try broadcasting 80
UNK_UNK did u change D to 88?
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK We need to increase FOS somehow
UNK_UNK only need a fos of 2
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK my part is a lot of the total weight
UNK_UNK That should be good
UNK_UNK Crap. I wish it would update automaticly
UNK_UNK its as small as itll go
UNK_UNK We have some wiggle room in our mass now, I can try adjusting my thicknesses and see if that helps 
UNK_UNK our value is really good right now
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK dang
UNK_UNK good point
UNK_UNK currently 55 mm unless you think a better value could be used
UNK_UNK tH doesn't effect me, can you try decreasing D 
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK like i kinda dgaf about 375 anymore
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK Are you still going with a crankshaft of 80?
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK I currently have 10 for thickness and 17.5 for diameter
UNK_UNK I'm starting with 40
UNK_UNK the one that is currently broadcasted is 6.92. Thats the max i can get
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK _|X|_
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK What's your max mass?
UNK_UNK No, I'm at 3.23. Trying to drop that a bit and lower my mass. I'm at 2.11 for mass.
UNK_UNK .53 and was .52
UNK_UNK I didn't change
UNK_UNK What's your current flywheel shaft diameter and thickness?
UNK_UNK I don't actually
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK try bearing offset = 180, crankshaft pin is 35 mm
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK have you lowered mass as much as you can?
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK so someone is a little confused
UNK_UNK probably
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK tf value of 10
UNK_UNK I didn't change anything
UNK_UNK Hey, have you broadcasted your values?
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK I think a tf value of 10 is best
UNK_UNK Whats your FOS
UNK_UNK select *
UNK_UNK hey i think that made things better!
UNK_UNK might need to change something else
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK that is for everyone, are you broadcasting your variables so that they are accounted for in the total global FOS?
UNK_UNK alright, just get FOS to right above 2 and that'll have to do
UNK_UNK No one change anything
UNK_UNK try to find a combo that gets you just above 2 fos but the lowest mass
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK 2.26
UNK_UNK D ds and tf
UNK_UNK Is that the lowest mass setting without compromising fos
UNK_UNK Nice.
UNK_UNK what's your FOS
UNK_UNK so connector rod is 600
UNK_UNK I change it to 80 now
UNK_UNK ok i will lessen the thickness!
UNK_UNK mine says 4.26 and 0.6
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK because the overall mass and FOS are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago, now they're horrible lol
UNK_UNK yea we need to figure out whos value changed
UNK_UNK Ok, mine is only .5. Idk how fos works but mine goes above 5k
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK 9.86
UNK_UNK your specific results will be in the table under the charts
UNK_UNK mine is currently m=0.02 and FOS=0.22 but my max FOS is 0.24
UNK_UNK For D = 75 and D = 85, what are the minimum masses you can have for a FOS of 2?
UNK_UNK yuh
UNK_UNK rn is very
UNK_UNK and mass?
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Im currently broadcasting c 60 dc 10 which is m .99 and fos .67
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK what are your current thickness and diameter?
UNK_UNK We need to figure out who has the highest mass and fos
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK wait someone changed something and it went way down
UNK_UNK Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important
UNK_UNK 0.45 kg to 4.43
UNK_UNK did you change the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK I need to know the piston bore diameter from you
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK it's poor again lol
UNK_UNK piston pin has theirs at 1.23 and says that's their highest option
UNK_UNK if we could decrease for another 2 kg we should get excellent
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK That makes no sense
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK So is there any tradeoff at all?
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK report weight
UNK_UNK What are your values
UNK_UNK Let me know if changing my D value could help improve the FOS or mass
UNK_UNK Right now we need to reduce mass and keep FOS. do u want to also see if anyone can do that so its not a free for all
UNK_UNK The mass increased alot do you know why
UNK_UNK mine depends on crankshaft
UNK_UNK what's your fos right now with 70mm diameter?
UNK_UNK I'm getting a FOS over 4000 with a thickness of 12, so I think 12 (the minumum) is fine
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK okay im at max fos
UNK_UNK what is your diameter?
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK now it dropped
UNK_UNK Should we do 75 for D or not so low
UNK_UNK I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
UNK_UNK good stick with that
UNK_UNK does a larger bore increase your FOS?
UNK_UNK with the different simulation numbers
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK They said they'd broadcast it, but yeah, still 80. IDK what's going on.
UNK_UNK I was testing the lower diameter for less mass. Changed it back now
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK t = 8
UNK_UNK what is going on
UNK_UNK GROUP: keep communicating!
UNK_UNK broadcast that
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK Do you need any information from me?
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK Ok, that's odd
UNK_UNK What are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK tf = 22 and ds = 49
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better for you if I use greater value
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK honestly the best bet for me would be a fos of above two and make the smallest weight possible
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK 5.75 @ 75
UNK_UNK i havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK Let me know what you decide
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better to use greater value because 40mm is the minimum value
UNK_UNK ok I change D right now its still 75
UNK_UNK I didnt
UNK_UNK variable that affects my mass and fos is just diameter, so I've been minimizing my "outputs" on that diameter
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK I haven't changed anything yet
UNK_UNK no i only see those 4
UNK_UNK use 15 for now as I try to find better values on my end
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK yeah nope
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK Am broadcasting 150 and 50
UNK_UNK I'm trying to test new values. I'm currently trying it with 80
UNK_UNK omggg
UNK_UNK We are hitting our requirements
UNK_UNK My system FS is 2.05 atm
UNK_UNK Right now I'm using D = 85
UNK_UNK What are your two variables at
UNK_UNK keeping fos at 2
UNK_UNK so probably not ideal right?
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK ohhhi see, it goes all the way up to 80
UNK_UNK I can, my lowest mass with the 45 bore diameter is 0.11, fos for that is 2.95
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75
UNK_UNK So far as I can tell, I just need to make sure that this number is smaller than your flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK dont change anything hahah nice
UNK_UNK We need an FOS of 2 don't we? We are at 1.1
UNK_UNK those values give the best FOS value ans 2nd lowest mass
UNK_UNK Amazing
UNK_UNK 0.52
UNK_UNK was that you?
UNK_UNK fos is very good
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Do you know how C affects your FoS
UNK_UNK Whats up
UNK_UNK it looks like someone changed the mass to be wrong but yea
UNK_UNK 1.31
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK what piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK please please try and get those sorted out ASAP and let me know if you need anything.  look at all your already run simulations and pick out the lowest mass and FOS then set your values to those
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK yeah it's not that simple
UNK_UNK Whats your mass and Fos?
UNK_UNK connecting rod: hold on, piston pin changing!
UNK_UNK didnt touch anything
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK I do not think so. you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers?
UNK_UNK i dont htink piston did either
UNK_UNK my mass values range from 1.13 to 3.12
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK Currently I have the lowest piston diameter selected, but in general yes lower diameter means lower mass and FOS
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK you?
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK ok looks like you have the biggest % of mass in our system
UNK_UNK Right now its at 90
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK can you try 80?
UNK_UNK c and d_c
UNK_UNK it doesnt matter if youre not the min FOS
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK ayyy the status is good somehow
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
UNK_UNK I think we are good
UNK_UNK wait, can you reduce the mass
UNK_UNK on my screen it says quality is excellent
UNK_UNK What piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK 75-105
UNK_UNK do you have any lower weight options above 2.06
UNK_UNK i think we should just leave it
UNK_UNK Mine has an FOS of 2.42
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK tell him to reply or ur changing ur value
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK cool, if you can minimize mass with a higher FS, do that
UNK_UNK 1.62 currently
UNK_UNK I can change diameter if needed
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK decreasing mass is gonna decrease my fos
UNK_UNK What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK no ive checked
UNK_UNK a higher D increases the mass and FOS. With 85, my mass is 13.09 and FOS is 7.69
UNK_UNK And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum
UNK_UNK 85 right now, I was trying to optimize mass
UNK_UNK I think c needs to be changed
UNK_UNK I think that is a good idea
UNK_UNK I dont have those variables on my diagrams, what do they represent?
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK I see 2.73
UNK_UNK what diameter have you chosen?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK sorry 60
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK Looks like were close again now
UNK_UNK its piston pin designer
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that
UNK_UNK yeah i see that
UNK_UNK right now at 88 shows very good
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK How much does our weight go up if you increase D?
UNK_UNK under performance requirements
UNK_UNK Can you improve FOS?
UNK_UNK for my component
UNK_UNK My flywheel is as small as possible. tf = 12 ds = 40. FOS is still in the thousands.
UNK_UNK now it's back ?? idk
UNK_UNK diameter is 80
UNK_UNK What variables do you need to consider?
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter, I got these values by setting D = 45 
UNK_UNK What levels of mass are you dealing with?
UNK_UNK what is the offset you have decided to use for the crannkshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK me as i finish this semester^
UNK_UNK good working with ya
UNK_UNK But my mass is like 0.9
UNK_UNK I think flywheel has the lowest fos
UNK_UNK Only way to get higher fos at 1.32 is to raise weight to 1.14
UNK_UNK I agree
UNK_UNK okay sounds good
UNK_UNK Thats a good option
UNK_UNK how about for fos
UNK_UNK sitting at 2.77
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK ok awesome
UNK_UNK they said they ddnt
UNK_UNK we have fair now
UNK_UNK can you try making it a bit bigger?
UNK_UNK Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK Yeah, the mass is huge otherwise
UNK_UNK For sure.
UNK_UNK ds tf and D
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK this is as good as i can get i think
UNK_UNK so increase FOS for one component now?
UNK_UNK Mass increases, but only by about 1kg at most and FoS increases by about 4
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK and*
UNK_UNK go back to what you had we were at good
UNK_UNK FOS is good. Mass is 10kg too high
UNK_UNK cool thanks
UNK_UNK *is
UNK_UNK 10.7
UNK_UNK yeap
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK If i increase diameter we go over weight. Still on lowest setting
UNK_UNK I have the piston set to near lowest mass (m=0.69 and fos = 3.84) sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK i have a fos of 2.47
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK 1.71 (mass range: 1.13 to 3.12) and 4.55 (fos range: 4.55 to 0.44)
UNK_UNK neither have we
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK 2.26 and 2.5
UNK_UNK switched to 43
UNK_UNK OK. Keep me posted
UNK_UNK just to see is it the one with the lowest ms and highest fos in the far right column?
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK hmm okay
UNK_UNK If we could lower the offset, that would optimize my fos
UNK_UNK Wait are we using D = 85 or 75?
UNK_UNK Let me know if you change the bearing offset
UNK_UNK I just need D which I'm working on with you and piston
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK no i do not
UNK_UNK so 225 could work
UNK_UNK what inputs do you control?
UNK_UNK do u know how many rounds we get?
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK Whats your mass and Fos?
UNK_UNK im also at 2 rn
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK It's 3.41
UNK_UNK now3.05
UNK_UNK r2 and r3
UNK_UNK what are your numbers
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK 1.27
UNK_UNK i shit you not lol.
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK It doesn't as far as I know, but the length of the crankshaft does. What is your current value for r?
UNK_UNK I will try that
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK do you need it to be higher or  lower?
UNK_UNK What is your max FOS? I think it would be worth it to try and get above 1
UNK_UNK I'm at fair quality. FOS is a bit low, total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though
UNK_UNK I'm testing to see how a crankshaft offset affects my fos and mass, first
UNK_UNK yep just did
UNK_UNK mine is currently 2.16 so I'll cut that a little closer
UNK_UNK makes sense, I'm checking with the others to see who is using the most mass
UNK_UNK we have excellent rn
UNK_UNK overall fos is decreawseing
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain FOS
UNK_UNK anything above a diamter of 47 gives me very low FOS
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK how will those affect your value
UNK_UNK For D = 75 and D = 85, what are the minimum masses you can have for a FOS of 2?
UNK_UNK but the weight incresases too
UNK_UNK This is strange
UNK_UNK mass is 0.54 and fos is 3286
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK dwhat is your current piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK .52. it's minimized
UNK_UNK those are my values and ranges
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK right now my mass is at .69 and my FS is 3.84
UNK_UNK dont do that
UNK_UNK any updates?
UNK_UNK we need mass to be less than 3
UNK_UNK if you can lower mass while keeping fos>2, try to
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK Where exactly do i check that?
UNK_UNK What is your fos?
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK im talking about your indidivudal part
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK Don't change it!
UNK_UNK Lmao thats massive
UNK_UNK I think you have the lowest FOS among all of us
UNK_UNK how much does the crankshaft currently weigh?
UNK_UNK you good if we start with a smaller bore diameter of 45? if that doesn't work we can increase it
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK Do you need any dimensions from me?
UNK_UNK Ok. I can now get FOS of over 3 for .12 kg so it works well for me but if you need to change it I can try other settings
UNK_UNK does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you?
UNK_UNK im at 2.36 for fos
UNK_UNK yea
UNK_UNK clarify flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness numbers
UNK_UNK 75
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK what's your mass
UNK_UNK Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK what values are you at
UNK_UNK do your projected outputs change when an update happens?
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK there are rounds?
UNK_UNK piston thinks youre suspicious!
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK it went down
UNK_UNK same here
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK i  believe at least one member's part is too heavy
UNK_UNK I currently have it as small as possible because that seems beneficial.
UNK_UNK Wow that's pretty high. Bearing support offset and crank-pin diameter
UNK_UNK my individual FOS is in the range of 2000. not sure how to compare that to 2FOS on a system wide level
UNK_UNK Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
UNK_UNK I haven't changed anything in the last five min
UNK_UNK Good job team
UNK_UNK I'm good too
UNK_UNK Did you change your broadcast by anychance?
UNK_UNK I have two I can jump behind but it depends on what everyone else can get m and fos to
UNK_UNK we are doing well right now
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK this is what i ahve rn
UNK_UNK I think there is but I don't know how.
UNK_UNK our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me, can you try and get them to talk to me :( I need to discuss values with them
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
UNK_UNK okay I don't need either of those in my analysis
UNK_UNK 58
UNK_UNK End experiment, nice worK!
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK great minds think alike
UNK_UNK but i backed you up
UNK_UNK dang that fos is low
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK I chose 40mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it's good for him or her if I use maximum value
UNK_UNK c=150, dc=45
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK I am thinking 82.5 which is the second smallest
UNK_UNK if you drop weight and i up the pin, we might still be ok
UNK_UNK is that your mass or FOS value
UNK_UNK what dimensions are you using
UNK_UNK Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction!
UNK_UNK What are you broadcasting?\
UNK_UNK looks like I picked a whole bouquet of oopsy daisies
UNK_UNK im at 2 rn
UNK_UNK mm
UNK_UNK as long fos isnt below 2 keep it
UNK_UNK Sounds good.  I'll try to decrease shaft mass
UNK_UNK Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
UNK_UNK see what the other group members say
UNK_UNK I can try, that is the limit tho
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK check for broadcast
UNK_UNK thats what they were at when we had excellent
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK It others peoples dimensions so im trying to figure that out
UNK_UNK do you think increase fos of lighter componet while decreasing fos of my part will work?
UNK_UNK should i ask their names
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK piston pin designer is having trouble maxing out his fos
UNK_UNK Lets not change it
UNK_UNK im not surprised,he has a pretty big head
UNK_UNK m at 1.63, fos at 53.27
UNK_UNK i did
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK flyehweel thickness and flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK thats a good idea
UNK_UNK and see what happens
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK Lower makes it worse
UNK_UNK I think its cause when anyone else changes their numberss it effects the other numbers
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK I've been talking with flywheel and he has very high mass ranges
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK do you depend on t1 or r1?
UNK_UNK My current fos is also 1.35
UNK_UNK no lol
UNK_UNK I'm not entirely sure. No matter what inputs I have, my mass and fos aren't changing and it;s a bit confusing
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin fos remains above 2
UNK_UNK it's corrected
UNK_UNK THis is tru. communicate with crankshaft. He's our weakest link FoS wise at the moment
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK Currently I think the mass is too much.
UNK_UNK I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong
UNK_UNK okay thats the most mass by far
UNK_UNK the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team
UNK_UNK Preston
UNK_UNK correct
UNK_UNK Okay, I'll play around with it
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK what are your values now?
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK What piston diameter are you using that works well?
UNK_UNK Was 12 and 40 still your used numbers?
UNK_UNK yeah increasing D changes mass by an enormous amount, like change of five adds 5 to ms
UNK_UNK _|O|O
UNK_UNK 5.2
UNK_UNK anyone know why it went back to poor?
UNK_UNK ok still at 60
UNK_UNK what is your fos for the 1.13?
UNK_UNK yeah haha
UNK_UNK Have you been changing the piston and seeing how the piston-pin can be changed?
UNK_UNK Yeah I don't know how.
UNK_UNK okay wait
UNK_UNK we should figure out who's FOS is 0.44
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
UNK_UNK it's very good right now
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK i don't need dc
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK whats your fos
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK so youre at the value that is closest to 2 fos/
UNK_UNK diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK no?
UNK_UNK go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
UNK_UNK What is the bearing offset? it just says 60 and I don't know if you have changed it
UNK_UNK We're good
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK 61.91
UNK_UNK Piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Do you know where our low Fos is coming from?
UNK_UNK Yeah for a bit.
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK great - please leave it there
UNK_UNK because i believe your part is the heaviest
UNK_UNK yeah they won't respond to my chats either
UNK_UNK It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same, but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but fos is reduced
UNK_UNK thickness is 10
UNK_UNK no boy we need both
UNK_UNK is that best case or worst case? my numbers are in the hundreds so we can play with ds if you use that
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK yeah they say they cant decrease it any more
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK That's odd, I don't have either of those variables
UNK_UNK The bearing support off set that is ideal for me is 40
UNK_UNK ok cause I have lowest fos so ill fail first meaning overall fos depends on me
UNK_UNK 12 is the best I got
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Our FOS went up
UNK_UNK can you broadcaset 150?
UNK_UNK fllywheel says their mass is 12708?
UNK_UNK Currently my Fos is 3.44
UNK_UNK I have FS = 3.03 with m = 0.12.
UNK_UNK at some point. need to get mass down
UNK_UNK oh noooo go back
UNK_UNK the one guy did not respond to my message
UNK_UNK I didn't change anything
UNK_UNK I cant decrease the weight without decreasing the facto of safety below 2
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK Mass: 1.75 FOS:6.07
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK are you making any changes  ?
UNK_UNK aight bet
UNK_UNK what mare mass values around an fos of 2
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK i didnt change
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK I haven't changed in 5 mins
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK I got fos 2.36
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK make sure it's broadcasting propperyly, I've had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all
UNK_UNK how do they affect the mass and safety factor
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK What's your current FOS?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Whats your fos?
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK try 51  for t and 50 for ds
UNK_UNK flywheel FOS are all very high
UNK_UNK i guess it's the system messing with us lol
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK very bad change
UNK_UNK so my guess is that if you're higher than 2 you're good
UNK_UNK what current mass and fos do you have?
UNK_UNK So good news, turns out the rod thickness increase from 6.5 mm to 7 mm increased the FOS by 0.23 but only increased the weight by 0.13 kg
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK A higher diameter increases the Fos but also increases the mass. with D=40 im at a mass of 0.1 and fos 2.77
UNK_UNK wait we're at very good
UNK_UNK 21.6, .97. still working
UNK_UNK Which FS are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK Change it back to a run with a FoS greater than 2
UNK_UNK We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK it just went back to "poor"
UNK_UNK Ahh nice
UNK_UNK that is the best I can get
UNK_UNK 0.06
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK So your mass is the largest contributor by far, can we reduce that at all?
UNK_UNK Mine is in the range of thousands.  So i guess I don't have to worry about it? only the smallest matters right
UNK_UNK for mass
UNK_UNK Have you messaged the others about this yet?
UNK_UNK and then my system depends on 3 other variables
UNK_UNK What would you like the D to be?
UNK_UNK if we all go for similar fos at around 3 we should be able to get global fos as 3 right?
UNK_UNK I m trying to pick a middle value
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK _ _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ _ _
UNK_UNK i don't think either of those affect me
UNK_UNK It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn't have to blindly flail about, not knowing who has been told what yet
UNK_UNK let me know what dims work for you and i can run simulations with them
UNK_UNK mine is at 2.03, dont think i can make changes, unless there is a better combination that requires changes from all of us
UNK_UNK We are compromising mass
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK we need to lower our mass
UNK_UNK what's the diameter at this point?
UNK_UNK Yeah a lower D gives me better numbers
UNK_UNK only (c) affects my Fos.  Butmy Fos is in the range of thousands so I don't think it matters too much.
UNK_UNK it's my best option
UNK_UNK Good job!
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK do you know if you can reduce mass?
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK the simulation results for me show the subsystem fos
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our fos significantly
UNK_UNK 9.09
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK fos?
UNK_UNK What did you guys get
UNK_UNK seems to be helping
UNK_UNK For just the flywheel?
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our FOS
UNK_UNK alright thanks!
UNK_UNK No i changed th piston head thickness but not the diameter
UNK_UNK only .7 away from excellent
UNK_UNK im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK Did you broadcast that
UNK_UNK so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
UNK_UNK piston has 2.01
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from crankshaft?
UNK_UNK I think it should be up
UNK_UNK okay can di
UNK_UNK Does youyr part depend on my values?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK new phone who dis?
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK mine's still showing 80
UNK_UNK wut
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK nice work
UNK_UNK 1.2
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK ok yeye
UNK_UNK i think so, I think i just figured out what i need to do. I was confused at first
UNK_UNK still mass = 9.86 and fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK or else the fos is very low
UNK_UNK impressive
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK Thanks :) I'll work with that for now, let me know if you end up making any final changes
UNK_UNK fos is 1.92 and mass is 1.46
UNK_UNK I'm happy with my numbers, but if you need to change something I will compensate
UNK_UNK I can sacrifice some fos if it will take off a lot of mass
UNK_UNK What mass ranges do you have the option of?
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK Yeah I won't
UNK_UNK a mass of 58 for one component automatically puts us in the poor mark
UNK_UNK *moving
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK does urs go straight
UNK_UNK Ok but what about the chart
UNK_UNK make sure to reduce weight and keep fos at 2
UNK_UNK the program won't let me go any lower
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK ok for me larger piston bore increases m and fos too
UNK_UNK what is the piston bore
UNK_UNK i  depennd on C
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at good
UNK_UNK What inputs do you need for calculating the diameter, if any?
UNK_UNK so even with 2.01 FOS we can get excellent
UNK_UNK fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK no 20 for him
UNK_UNK Same happened to me a bit ago
UNK_UNK is there any way you can increase fos
UNK_UNK What about flywheel thickness "tf"? I noticed a change in "tf" that I didn't broadcast
UNK_UNK interesting
UNK_UNK ok never mind then
UNK_UNK tf increases mass...
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft
UNK_UNK Working with you and piston as well
UNK_UNK i am at my lowest
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK how much does that effect your numbers
UNK_UNK flywheel boi is tryna improve
UNK_UNK Okay update your D but try to keep it relatively low if possible
UNK_UNK What is your FOS and mass at currently?
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK is our global FS just the lowest part FS?
UNK_UNK Only the piston diameter D affects my part
UNK_UNK nah, we only have 2 mins left
UNK_UNK We're at very good, I say we leave it at this
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK what is your mass/fos
UNK_UNK Her, how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK _|X|_
UNK_UNK I raised mine to 2.28 so someone made a change to something much lower than that
UNK_UNK XIXIO
UNK_UNK what crankshaft offset is ideal for your design? I need it to design the flywheel
UNK_UNK The only way i can get higher fos is if piston diameter D is 43 is lower
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77
UNK_UNK what is your Fos and mass?
UNK_UNK r2 and r3 of the piston pin
UNK_UNK 1.7 with bearing offset of 300
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK when i try to bump FS up it moves us from very good to good so im  leaving it
UNK_UNK great, thanks!
UNK_UNK What is the offset that is working well for you?
UNK_UNK Just broadcasted it. I set D at 55
UNK_UNK same here. it would reduce my masses a bit
UNK_UNK since we are at the threshold for fs
UNK_UNK damn, same here 
UNK_UNK i'm not
UNK_UNK what is the lowest mass you got while keeping FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK i dont have 85, i have 82.5
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK nevermind i am at the minimum thickness setting
UNK_UNK increases it
UNK_UNK what really?
UNK_UNK I get better fos but worse mass when i maximize c, so it problably needs to be in the middle
UNK_UNK my best was 1.67 at a bore diameter of 45
UNK_UNK I'm broadcasting my lowest I got
UNK_UNK 4.55
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK 5625.56
UNK_UNK 4
UNK_UNK Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS > 2?
UNK_UNK Please let me know if you change the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK the plot on the white board
UNK_UNK hmmm im not sure
UNK_UNK I feel like its the crankshaft guy, everyone else has high fos
UNK_UNK yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight
UNK_UNK piston told me
UNK_UNK whats your fos at
UNK_UNK 0.86
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK What values do you need?
UNK_UNK what is your offset right now
UNK_UNK they said they didnt change it
UNK_UNK Has the crankshaft got back to you about his FOS?
UNK_UNK yeah try that
UNK_UNK I can ask but I'm worried not everyone's was updated
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK Someone picked an FS of 0.51
UNK_UNK mass is to 4
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK did you change?
UNK_UNK do you know why?
UNK_UNK thought
UNK_UNK ill try decreasing my mass slightly
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK I changed to 0.37, fos of 11.
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK assuming diameter is 40, is that true?
UNK_UNK and FOS?
UNK_UNK whats your lower limit?
UNK_UNK getting close
UNK_UNK i can't go lower than this
UNK_UNK mine are 1.71 (mass range: 1.13 to 3.12) and 4.55 (fos range: 4.55 to 0.44)
UNK_UNK someone changed their amss
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK yes can do
UNK_UNK I just got my mass down to 0.11
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Currently 2.95
UNK_UNK awesome fos
UNK_UNK not much, my Fs will decrease dramatically for a drop in 0.03 mass
UNK_UNK They asked and I gave them 40mm. I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them, and they have not responded
UNK_UNK my part minimized the mass while keeping FOS>2, will keep updating it
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK if you increase the diameter
UNK_UNK are those variables L and r?
UNK_UNK looks like we're good
UNK_UNK we are using 75 mm rn
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK How much does your part weigh?
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain FOS
UNK_UNK thanks!
UNK_UNK yes, i design the c and dc
UNK_UNK 45=1.7, 48=1.15
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK Idon't have that information, but check the front page of your packet
UNK_UNK the smaller those two values are, the lighter the part is, but it gets weaker
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK smaller is better for me as well
UNK_UNK hey, Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be 10 mm, is this what you got?
UNK_UNK mines at 3.84
UNK_UNK Looks like our FOS went up
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK so i dont think that i can change that much
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK uh, piston guy says D = 40
UNK_UNK What is your fos?
UNK_UNK i dont think it actually changes the FOS
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK did you change the mass?
UNK_UNK but I think we're struggling with FOS now
UNK_UNK _|_|o _|X|_ _|_|_
UNK_UNK try using 50 mm
UNK_UNK It was good for a second, what happened
UNK_UNK that's a requirement
UNK_UNK Mine's 2.03. Don't think I can get that lower
UNK_UNK Can you change that to 85?  or close to it?  That's what I have
UNK_UNK alright.
UNK_UNK which I just tried but someone else must have made a change at the same time
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK we're almost out of time, double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK do you have an input i should try?
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK what are yous mass/fos
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK Im at 4.09
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK w
UNK_UNK flywheel would...
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK FOS = 2, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK The greater the values for either of those, the greater the FOS and mass
UNK_UNK whats the lowest/highest mass and fos for you
UNK_UNK because it just skyrocketed
UNK_UNK lol sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK i'm asking around rn
UNK_UNK are you limited by D to determine L? we may be able to increase D and reduc eL for a weigh tsavings.
UNK_UNK just wait it out
UNK_UNK Yea, but also the weight
UNK_UNK Global quality looking bad though
UNK_UNK Ok thank you.
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK slightly
UNK_UNK I did it do you see it?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Hey, I'm good for now, thanks. let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK same, i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK Fos = 1215
UNK_UNK nice nice
UNK_UNK which you control
UNK_UNK whats your mass at?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK interstingly pisto-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK I am in charge of diameter and piston head thickness. Increasing diameter will increase the area, so more force, but also increase mass. Increasing head thickness will increase mass but also FOS
UNK_UNK yea, idk who changed a value. If we cant figure it out, I can lower the piston 4 pounds
UNK_UNK For the flywheel shaft diameter i have 10
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK Its at very good
UNK_UNK can try small changes
UNK_UNK yeah change it back
UNK_UNK yep raised it
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK tf of 10 is the best for mass
UNK_UNK Okay I'm using my results for 80
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK piston pin has ds
UNK_UNK If you increase the piston bore diameter (D) it increases my FOS
UNK_UNK ok Ill try that
UNK_UNK Alright, b/c we have the given parameter LDr = 1.2 and I have control of D
UNK_UNK we just bumped up top fair
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK X X O ; _ O _ ; X O _
UNK_UNK For connecting rod design, I need to know your piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Whichever gets you the highest
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK Maybe. not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up
UNK_UNK yo uright
UNK_UNK diameter just updated back to 80
UNK_UNK *conrod
UNK_UNK are you changing
UNK_UNK lets take bets on who goes rogue
UNK_UNK Ok. Our FOS isn't too bad right now so that's probably a good place to be at the moment
UNK_UNK what is your current mass and fos?
UNK_UNK I still see the total mass of 2.84
UNK_UNK 1
UNK_UNK hommie we need to decrease weight not increase FOS ^^^^^^^^
UNK_UNK I'm now at 2.77, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK also input piston bore diameter in mm
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK 0.1
UNK_UNK 2.36
UNK_UNK dc at 45
UNK_UNK yup
UNK_UNK how do i know it wasnt you??
UNK_UNK Who depends on your variables?
UNK_UNK I'm going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass, we're not doing too bad with fos
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK $2 missed
UNK_UNK is your FOS 1.79?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK I am having it at 40
UNK_UNK You're right!
UNK_UNK No, I believe my variables are independent of shaft diameter
UNK_UNK 85 is the updated
UNK_UNK it updates the global model
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK it's at very good for me
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK I'm still seeing 'poor' on my end
UNK_UNK its 1.92
UNK_UNK I think I can work with that
UNK_UNK Right, so I just used 75 and I my FOS is still about 2
UNK_UNK yeah that sounds like a good plan
UNK_UNK quality looks very good so idk?
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK what is c?
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK mas is up pretty high
UNK_UNK as i increase it I can increase FOS some
UNK_UNK we were at excellent but now its very good
UNK_UNK you mean the global variables? the FOS is 0.57 right now
UNK_UNK 0.52
UNK_UNK at excellent so dont change anything
UNK_UNK should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK sorry their FOS
UNK_UNK its 3.24
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK I think you should try to lower your diameter to 45 or so and see what happens.
UNK_UNK pretty good, how about yourself
UNK_UNK no it is not
UNK_UNK The FOS is 2.03, so there are no improvements available
UNK_UNK GOOD***
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK yea our values are horrible
UNK_UNK Is your FS really low?
UNK_UNK next smallest i can go to is 75 and thats the minimum
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK Who is this?
UNK_UNK O|X|X
UNK_UNK Let me know what piston bore diameters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK I need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK What's a good working piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK We're going in the wrong direction for both
UNK_UNK We need to trim mass
UNK_UNK i still have my two best broadcasted
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK rn my mass is 6.5 and fos is 2.09
UNK_UNK 2 is the max FOS that we neeed
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
UNK_UNK It was up and then it went down for some reason
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting those values?
UNK_UNK So what is your c value?
UNK_UNK #ERROR!
UNK_UNK you there
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK My max is only 0.24 but I can increase it to 0.22 while only adding 0.01 mass
UNK_UNK Idk if we have certain rounds or not
UNK_UNK ya, try 75
UNK_UNK sorry
UNK_UNK Yeah looking better
UNK_UNK ill ask
UNK_UNK Ok we're good I think
UNK_UNK do you have the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK we're at good pull your weight
UNK_UNK When I use maximum values, the mass is 36.38 and f is 22.95.
UNK_UNK *Your change. I got typing too fast
UNK_UNK Piston diameter still 90?
UNK_UNK Try 15
UNK_UNK If you reduce FOS to around 2, can we reduce weight?
UNK_UNK Awesome
UNK_UNK How is your design coming along, do you need any data from me?
UNK_UNK No I didn't
UNK_UNK damn
UNK_UNK because any FS over like 10 shouldnt really effect the system right
UNK_UNK D = 80!! mistyped
UNK_UNK At 75 diameter for me, the best I have is 2.85FOS and 6.26mass
UNK_UNK nevermind I'm being stupid
UNK_UNK don't know if we can stop or if we have to go the full 45 minutes
UNK_UNK sorry 225 first
UNK_UNK ok what about mass?
UNK_UNK or does it at all
UNK_UNK what is the thickness you have on that right now with a d=15?
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK good job!
UNK_UNK Has yours updated yet?
UNK_UNK No. My values have been the same since about 9:45.
UNK_UNK piston says flywheel is lowest fos
UNK_UNK i have 1.27
UNK_UNK something changed we were closer
UNK_UNK someone touched it
UNK_UNK Is there anything you can do to reduce mass without changing fos much?
UNK_UNK ik lol
UNK_UNK I get higher weight if D decreases
UNK_UNK Are you changing stuff or is it still the crankshaft
UNK_UNK can you go higher now?
UNK_UNK ok i'll ask around
UNK_UNK that's big
UNK_UNK does a larger diameter increase your mass? or decrease it?
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
UNK_UNK mine is 2.09
UNK_UNK What is the relationship between those two and FOS? For D, increasing it increases area and therefore the max gas force, but also will increase mass
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK yea it was perfect a minute ago
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK I reduced the diameter to 40mm to reduce the mass of the system
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK No i don't think so
UNK_UNK d = 18
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK we are soooo close
UNK_UNK I'm asking around
UNK_UNK dont change anyhting
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK same 60 is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now
UNK_UNK no problem
