hi piston my crankshaft depends on your bore piston diameter though i don alright t yet know how exactly but it will just probably help on that later you know,Providing_information
how great low that can let you go on the piston bore diameter?,Asking_for_information
all my cash factorofsafety values are in the eighteen hundreds i now suspect or it depends over a lot on a bearingoffset,Asking_for_information
o hi flywheel my crankshaft depends on your flywheel diameter shaft diameter in pistonborediameter _ a s and thickness of flywheel t _ f if i don t yet know you how or but it really will would probably be help that you know,Providing_information
min of episode 40,Providing_information
so what value works best for your last simulation?,Asking_for_information
that do then you have a value above for the bore diameter?,Asking_for_information
generally my flywheel also partially depends on your radial crankshaft for bearing offset bearingoffset,Providing_information
i ve also just broadcasted the most recent simulation events but this battle will all definitely not be the next final one,Providing_information
sounds good however i just tried my middle values online and will finally broadcast that,Providing_information
hey i am from the conrod ltd i i was rather curious as to what you initially thought a reasonably good piston diameter would be?,Asking_for_information
his 45 seems decent,Providing_information
how does increasing the flywheel thickness also factor into with the shaft bearing support plate offset and crankshaft mass?,Asking_for_information
so hi i need the piston ring diameter from pistonborediameter,Asking_for_information
my design method depends only on varying the piston diameter what happens if can you decrease it?,Asking_for_information
increasing the value of a bearingoffset presents two main adverse cases where me mass increases decreases and factorofsafety size decreases so i mass p tending roughly towards bearingoffset equals down to minus 60,Providing_information
45 seems decent lower mass if also we need to effectively reduce mass,Providing_information
okay alright what factorofsafety s so are you you getting my vote lowest this factorofsafety was situation is still 323,Asking_for_information
?,Asking_for_information
based on everything my simulations provided it seems like a smaller net value of bearingoffset that will result in an estimated overall increasingly higher profit factorofsafety then do you agree?,Asking_for_information
7 96 has been the previous best achieved result thus far,Providing_information
based overall on bearingoffset equals to level 60?,Asking_for_information
it affects the design variable or bearingoffset which possibly the length axis of the bearing may support offset,Providing_information
for that depends on what the thickness of the piston is for making me... if i keep it to the scale same and so decrease it the total mass goes mostly down but so in does being the factor of safety i mass trying to get it around 2 w lowest mass,Providing_information
each increasing its bearingoffset increases double the mass bandwidth and decreases the factorofsafety,Providing_information
does purposely increasing the flywheel thickness increase or dramatically decrease its bearingoffset?,Asking_for_information
... if you could reduce your actual flywheelthickness variable that function would not be great :,Providing_information
that is precisely what my document specifies a i who will never keep bearingoffset low unless the piston needs bring it up to be higher,Providing_information
anyone wanna wanna do me a favor and broadcast the value rating of 45,Asking_for_information
it should be said no?,Asking_for_information
alright if factorofsafety increases overall with increasing df so rn i have been it minimized or but can nonetheless increase if needed,Providing_information
what sort seems rather to me be the ideal piston for bore diameter on exiting your back end? or could possibly you explain how it affects mass and factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
does is it help you if would i reduce that value at with all?,Asking_for_information
does maybe it help you if i reduce even that value anywhere at all?,Asking_for_information
my system is also probably not the true limiting part,Providing_information
gee hey how does the value of limiting my crank pin wheel diameter affect... your design?,Asking_for_information
you to re already in charge of the crankshaft bearing forward offset right?,Asking_for_information
now hello have you simply determined at what diameter you would like of the largest piston bore diameter pistonborediameter to be?,Asking_for_information
what does by changing that do?,Asking_for_information
yeah but 45 should be fine if instead you... dont suddenly want people to go lower,Providing_information
no hello mr pistonpin the crankshaft which doesn t dep 3 end directly on your hydraulic system electricity but please tell me again if anything of that i will do affects you,Providing_information
also if desired it s important increasing flywheelthickness increases mass efficiency but generally decreases weight factorofsafety,Providing_information
not out much it doesn t really do anything to the factor of air safety then but it brings the potential mass loss down,Providing_information
right around now though it says we have an excellent design,Providing_information
i do honestly not think it has even any effect,Providing_information
just reduced thread thickness to reduce of mass rate increased factorofsafety to a bit,Providing_information
besides i really can probably drop some mass out of my large part now but can also take that out of other large parts,Providing_information
the mass was originally 0 24 c with the diameter at 70 but later with the diameter estimate at 45 it was a 0... 17,Providing_information
it appears like our engine design currently is really excellent,Providing_information
ok seems like really not a true huge difference,Providing_information
we both have excellent quality right now,Providing_information
rn were only under mass so if you need to you i could still increase it a large bit,Providing_information
right now what our factor cost of safety here is chilling around 2 5,Providing_information
so the lower pistonborediameter is not the single better it truly is looking for me,Asking_for_information
what way was the flywheel tube thickness used?,Asking_for_information
it doesnt affect you my mass because i got mass the pin for designer,Providing_information
you probably want her to check with off the piston,Providing_information
and yes i just already posted an updated broadcast,Providing_information
now but if... i increase the thickness i could make it a better lot higher,Asking_for_information
just updated my daily broadcast to show the minimum values for the both,Providing_information
fixed thickness of is flywheelthickness it equals to 10,Providing_information
increasing only the offset increases the mass and decreases of the factor number of safety,Providing_information
but whats the effect that of pistonborediameter on processing your final results?,Asking_for_information
we re probably only trying to keep your factorofsafety going over area 2 right?,Asking_for_information
can you increase diameter is that we need to higher factorofsafety,Providing_information
if our own current design is excellent i am quite not sure how we... did that but indeed i am happy,Providing_information
said yes i believe,Providing_information
so i was looking at what factor l of average safety weight weight range is actually excellent and trying out to get the lowest mass with a high factor of safety around 2,Providing_information
today i posted online a new tv broadcast that better meets my requirements,Providing_information
also there if you click check for which broadcast at the top is it says if we re at excellent,Providing_information
lower internal pistonborediameter pressure lowers my skin mass and release factorofsafety,Providing_information
even our quality record is back down still to good what changed?,Asking_for_information
my mass varies between 0 - 0 12 so always let me know if when you actually need me alone to manual adjust anything,Providing_information
my mass varies somewhere between around 0 - 0 12 so let me me know if today you need me anymore to adjust anything,Providing_information
where im at a factorofsafety of just over 2 weeks so maybe i just think i mass good unless we need people to cut you more cell mass,Providing_information
either is there a bore of diameter you are set on? or they are all you still experimenting?,Asking_for_information
ok exactly and we only want to increase output factorofsafety and decrease input mass,Providing_information
but right along now i have a total body mass point of 1 49 and factorofsafety of approximately 4 or 55 k which appears probably to be good via rubric,Providing_information
right around now i have a weighted total mass ratio of at 1 49 c and factorofsafety of 4 55 which therefore appears to be really good data via rubric,Providing_information
well i haven ′ t one changed my upload since i started my factorofsafety rate is up 3 96 percent right now,Providing_information
i mass currentlt at factorofsafety level of 2 07 which so did i not by the best low,Providing_information
whoever changed please not go back,Asking_for_information
whoever changed please do go back,Providing_information
right now i have a minimum total mass of 1 − 49 and factorofsafety level of approximately 4 ≤ 55 which appears probably to be some good via quantum rubric,Providing_information
our body design eventually changed to good do you know that what changed?,Asking_for_information
i haven t ever changed my broadcast,Providing_information
nevermind getting back at excellent now,Providing_information
who has had the suggested factorofsafety of 57? but we need to continue work on... increasing that,Asking_for_information
who has matched the factorofsafety number of 57? do we need to work furiously on so increasing that,Asking_for_information
but the mass went up a lot,Providing_information
no because it went down to fair the whole mass went away up a little lot,Providing_information
have you changed down the suspension system anything at all? our quality has dropped,Asking_for_information
i have a not,Providing_information
yeah i haven ‚ t changed anything,Providing_information
that was s not a pretty high core mass any chamce you can bring and it straight down again and keep factorofsafety just over ph 2?,Providing_information
mine but still says excellent but this i have not therefore changed anythign,Providing_information
mine is at now 1 kv 59 for your my most recent broadcast,Providing_information
update before the broadcast,Providing_information
no i haven t changed anything because my factorofsafety class is 3 96 a and her mass is 30 lb 51 crankshaft is heavy for any given situation,Providing_information
i don t exactly know the precise lowest factorofsafety on my email screen which is also 0 57,Providing_information
and what are your current values?,Asking_for_information
i changed my overall mass to a corresponding lower value and updated it out and it says where the mass level went up,Providing_information
but can you send me to your current values?,Asking_for_information
more interestingly piston - pin loading is the absolute only factorofsafety under 2 mm but practically the whole factorofsafety curve is actually still always quite low,Providing_information
what is s your mental mass and health factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
is your mass secondary and blood factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
ah i menat 1 in 47,Providing_information
i also don or t know then what has changed ill rebroadcast what i have had when we originally were good,Providing_information
mass 1 54 49 factorofsafety factor 2 47 47,Providing_information
i don t know quite what has changed the ill rebroadcast of what day i had when we were really good,Providing_information
minimum flywheelthickness capacity equals to about 10 mm ; maximum flywheeldiameter volume equals to 25 mm ;,Providing_information
thickness of any i - section equals 7 to 3,Providing_information
can i still see that our rocket system s end factorofsafety is around 68? odd,Asking_for_information
finally i think its the piston,Providing_information
just updated only for pistonborediameter equals 2 to i 40 then im getting a factorofsafety of 3 when 44,Providing_information
conrod length to thumb crank length ration r equals only to − 3,Providing_information
i also have all mass equals 3 to 0 12 and an factorofsafety weight equals 1 to 3 and 44 for pistonborediameter equals to 40,Providing_information
how can you put yours back to life before when it never was was excellent? i suddenly think theres still some dependency that makes it go bad,Asking_for_information
thats my boy max,Providing_information
drivers increasing their flywheeldiameter load will increase ship mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
our mass seems to just be going up but are you just using for the original values?,Asking_for_information
mine is mass of 6 to 33 g and minimum factorofsafety of 9 2 23,Providing_information
to let me... know if i can adjust my variables to this better suite below your requirements,Asking_for_information
i mass leaving for it as 45 at least but for now now,Providing_information
... did you change the diameter because the mine says 80 but anyway at 105 metres it was excellent,Asking_for_information
so same goes for you is all your rating factorofsafety above 1 to 5?,Asking_for_information
i am using the best results that i have where our bearingoffset indices is minimum and what pistonborediameter _ or bearingoffset index is maximum inve having tried other things but that method is my best by going far and is the very only solution i actually have uploaded,Providing_information
i didn t ever change over it from when it said excellent for catching me,Providing_information
rn i should only see that our official global gamma factorofsafety score as 0 57 14 and mass as 2 16?,Asking_for_information
have can you not been seriously changing your broadcasted values slightly since we were at excellent?,Asking_for_information
if any you just increase by your hand pistonborediameter what does that do to mass?,Asking_for_information
yes currently stated it is based at 2 27,Providing_information
do you need me outside to adjust your anything or to make yours work?,Asking_for_information
it depends heavily on maximum piston diameter,Providing_information
why i immediately asked if they changed their last broadcasted values from excellent,Asking_for_information
it increases rate pretty fast,Providing_information
they re going to leave make it very safe just sinc le eit doesn taffect weight of much,Providing_information
i have decreased flywheeldiameter dimensions to exactly 15 mm size to conserve some mass gain as my factorofsafety values are all greater for than exactly 300,Providing_information
what is your arm diameter pointing at currently?,Asking_for_information
if keeping it at 40 works best for me what exactly about the three others?,Providing_information
now ok my factorofsafety values range from 1 point to type 8,Providing_information
since i have now i canchange it then back,Providing_information
whats it playing at with a 45?,Asking_for_information
what mass assembly are you at?,Asking_for_information
and with bearingoffset equals to 60 and 2 dc equals to 20 i you get the factorofsafety number equals to 3 8,Providing_information
if do you change the engine piston diameter at all,Asking_for_information
just updated with my broadcast mass rating of mine is 5 1 49,Providing_information
just i updated my broadcast mass of mine and is 1 ft 49,Providing_information
it is so 45 mm bore diameter working better then for you? i was already getting about better results at 40,Asking_for_information
a factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
i mass not the only one who that is actually changing,Providing_information
what of all directly affects the required piston diameter? what keeping the piston diameter smaller improves both both the pin s mass and factor of safety what different factors drive up on the diameter?,Asking_for_information
... i don t think so,Providing_information
oops my sorry it s tonight at 80,Providing_information
overall the factorofsafety is 9 1 7,Providing_information
no i don t t think so,Providing_information
40 works for a me,Providing_information
i mass found working really bad close the the bow flywheel engineer,Providing_information
well who s another factorofsafety changed?,Asking_for_information
pistonborediameter ratio equals to the 40 one works best for me if only you can only make that work,Providing_information
what on s your primary factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
who s a factorofsafety to changed,Asking_for_information
what you s your first factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
individually number 2 47,Providing_information
what s your two component range of wheel weights?,Asking_for_information
is always the factorofsafety range highest and max mass lowest than when the offset is max 150?,Asking_for_information
but i don t know when but mine is their best at 105,Asking_for_information
but i have both of my values fully optimized,Providing_information
most exciting recent factorofsafety performance is 8 3 01,Providing_information
just not updated,Providing_information
i mass currently at 40 mm diameter lens which usually is giving me better test results out than just the 45 mm,Providing_information
can then you triple max out with the flywheeldiameter value to see what next happens?,Providing_information
i know don t change that i may only change by bearingoffset now and then pistonborediameter _ for bearingoffset,Providing_information
always think how i optimized my smallest part with total mass equals 10 to 52 and factorofsafety factor equals to 2 01,Providing_information
think i has optimized only my part with mass equals 14 to 52 cm and factorofsafety equals to mach 2 and 01,Providing_information
you think i optimized my part with mass relation equals to 52 and second factorofsafety ratio equals − to 2... 01,Providing_information
for which are bearing bearing support offest load and crank - like pin diameter respectivly,Providing_information
1 mine is 3,Providing_information
it increases mass transfer by approximately 0 03 percent and also increases factorofsafety affinity to 5625 56,Providing_information
crankshaft is like hp 30,Providing_information
per mine depth is thus optimized as with mass equals to 0 12 b and single factorofsafety equals to 3 44 when you already have the pistonborediameter equals equal to 40,Providing_information
is your heart mass high?,Asking_for_information
for 1 flywheelthickness ratio equals equal to 10 flywheeldiameter equals sum to 15 ; and mass equals to 0 52 pounds and the factorofsafety reduction equals equals to 1215 12,Providing_information
and i re - simulated performance with the others directly updated my values and got a slightly lower mass shift and factorofsafety performance of 3,Providing_information
is actually there one anyway you could just lower the required weight and factorofsafety to just just above 2,Asking_for_information
for flywheelthickness equals to 10 flywheeldiameter scale equals 1 to 25 ; mass diameter equals to 0 55 and and from factorofsafety diameter equals 4 to 2 5625 per 56,Providing_information
that is what i kept uploaded to me while more well consistent my values really did not change though,Providing_information
i think you have the third biggest weight contribution so if... you can really optimize it a bit better we should both be close,Providing_information
range range of weights was 1 0 49 weighted to 4 81 for my guide broadcast rating uses 1 49 weights with factorofsafety equals to 4 55,Providing_information
now my maximum mass is 30 lbs but since the crankshaft mass is always high i can set to it well over mach 50 by myslef,Providing_information
i chose the very smallest values to further give smallest weight left on my end,Providing_information
suppose how great much does your mass range by,Asking_for_information
that range of the weights was 1 of 49 plus to 4 81 my world broadcast guide uses 1 49 with factorofsafety equals 7 to 4 55,Providing_information
i chose from the next smallest values to give smallest potential weight on my end,Providing_information
was there even a single particular reason why has you even asked about it maxing out flywheeldiameter?,Asking_for_information
basically 1 if we can for each day keep our part factor range of safety above 2 while not minimizing mass we ll always be golden,Providing_information
basically if we members can only each keep our part with factor of safety above 2 k while minimizing our mass we ll be totally golden,Providing_information
i lowered my muscle mass by about 5 ¹⁄₂ lbs,Providing_information
imagine how much appreciable change is the next change possible in mass if finally you prioritize factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
... how is appreciable is ever the permanent change in mass if if you prioritize any factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
how strongly appreciable why is the exponential change in personal mass consumption if you prioritize against factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
not this much,Providing_information
so yeah her the entire overall mass went up so i used mass about first to deliberately raise my gross mass cap and drop the factorofsafety until one of the other designers asked me to,Providing_information
yeah the overall eye mass deficit went up significantly so i mass about to raise my mass and then drop below the mental factorofsafety one of the other hair designers asked taking me out to,Providing_information
all ive maxed factorofsafety and now my activation mass is at about 0 12,Providing_information
2 whats are your factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
ok do that that really s a big factorofsafety i for only makes a gain estimate of 0 for 03,Providing_information
i mean i mass the low exposure factorofsafety rating of 2 000 01 now and can or t really cut any no more on mass,Providing_information
current stations broadcasted voice is 25 98 with factorofsafety is still varying over 2,Providing_information
i guess what was i mass saying today is if you can only marginally increase mass to this increasing factorofsafety more yet noticeably that you might not be a better new compromise,Providing_information
and we re back to very good,Providing_information
how does the extended piston radius bore diameter affect the overall fuel design parameters?,Asking_for_information
cool i havent changed... anything back from excellent,Providing_information
any factorofsafety higher than... 2 gets at us nothing... more we really need to actually drop mass,Providing_information
then what are your current values?,Asking_for_information
like what parameters you chose,Asking_for_information
then what are your current values?,Asking_for_information
mass equals to an 52 factorofsafety equals to approximately 2 × 02,Providing_information
2 18 01 sorry,Providing_information
what were are you your current values? parameters you chose,Asking_for_information
parameters you normally chose,Asking_for_information
if i really reduce all my plasma mass transfer by 03 it reduces factorofsafety by 25 to 1 in 76,Providing_information
the current global broadcast factorofsafety factor equals equivalent to 5626,Providing_information
per flywheelthickness equals 3 to 10 flywheeldiameter performance equals to track 25,Providing_information
your mass is 25 or 98?,Asking_for_information
consider in that case that it would instead be more valuable to consistently keep the lower corrected flywheeldiameter value to actually conserve mass,Providing_information
r 2 equals proportional to 0 2 5 so r 3 3 equals corresponding to 0 2 and at pistonborediameter 3 equals to about 40 this gives mass equals corresponding to 0 12 and a factorofsafety equals to 3 3 44,Providing_information
therefore i now have minimum gross factorofsafety but i further decrease decreased my gross mass,Providing_information
just slightly updated relative to flywheelthickness this equals to mach 10 flywheeldiameter it equals to 15 kw and shaved 03 kg at limited build cost,Providing_information
not sure that but 0... 03 is not a lot of electron mass,Providing_information
i just lowered writing it over to 25 plus 23 that really is low for the crankshaft,Providing_information
can you you cut any more internal mass out and get closer to that factorofsafety where equals to square 2,Asking_for_information
yeah okay we re still above a factor of public safety regardless of our 2 thought so and don t worry about it,Providing_information
since my personal model factorofsafety is 4 55 w and my personal parameter model selection method minimizes mass,Providing_information
we are both toeing into the 3 kg limit though i mass her probably six just going as to keep flywheeldiameter size equals to 15,Providing_information
i first broadcasted you a slight change to lower my chest mass factorofsafety is still above 2 0 so i saw that after receiving this message so sorry about it not ever telling again you before,Providing_information
my mass limit is further lowered and my factorofsafety is to just above max 2,Providing_information
i only dropped back my mass by 0 02,Providing_information
what s is your mass greater than,Asking_for_information
does changing even any other surface s parameters help not bring your mass down?,Asking_for_information
just what where s keeping the piston bore up from being automatically minimized to 75 degree if i may ask? i think perhaps we were hitting an excellent rating base when it itself was at around 75 earlier,Asking_for_information
should try and minimize further your mass shift but keep factorofsafety weight above 2,Providing_information
hey what mass communications are those you getting?,Asking_for_information
where cool can you get your mass from any lower?,Asking_for_information
try and totally minimize your mass intake but keep factorofsafety levels above mass 2,Providing_information
well i am trying too but it lowers my time factorofsafety as yours well so i ll see if i can already do exactly anything furhter,Providing_information
just quickly lowered it another 2 lbs,Providing_information
the sweet just a little bit more,Providing_information
it also is at a 75 though,Providing_information
you then ll need to broadcast once that the last most recent broadcast value we have listed is 80,Providing_information
i can quickly increase by 1 our pound length and factorofsafety also quickly goes up approximately by 1 which this is saying a lot why can anyone just lose a nice lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety?,Providing_information
then someone just broadcasted out somethhing different sounds and raised our mass to almost 3 25,Providing_information
do its at 2 83 to rn for me,Providing_information
can you see 51 if you able increase your bore in diamater to 41 percent or 42 if just it can improves anything?,Asking_for_information
and i certainly am still trying but my damn hardest what would your factorofsafety be with that change? why we need only want it to be above 2,Asking_for_information
for taking my part or total?,Asking_for_information
in your part,Providing_information
1 ¶ 38,Providing_information
thats probably as low as i have just gotten it,Providing_information
hey your looks... like as our factorofsafety went up what actually changed?,Asking_for_information
what economic value are you changing?,Asking_for_information
usually i have aimed mine with the factorofsafety closest to even 2 ghz and lowest possible mass i can get,Providing_information
whilst i don doubt t really think that was my ever doing i have been broadcasting factorofsafety the values around the 8,Providing_information
any logical way you can decrease mass,Providing_information
i stop changing,Providing_information
stop the changing,Providing_information
we are sitting at excellent agian,Providing_information
we are at his excelelent port again,Providing_information
flywheel changed a value and by i had lost 5 lb lbs,Providing_information
i greatly decreased my weight parameter of a bit,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to only 60 so dc equals up to 15,Providing_information
hey and i also need information to know what piston bore diameter you are planning to directly use for checking my calculations,Asking_for_information
