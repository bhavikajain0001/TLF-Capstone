237,on how does how the flywheel thickness will factor back into the bearing support offset weight and crankshaft mass?,0,1,0,0,0,0
238,my valve design depends on the ideal piston diameter then what happens so if you decrease it?,1,0,0,0,0,0
239,increasing back the value distribution of a bearingoffset presents two similar adverse cases where mine mass increases substantially and my factorofsafety decreases so as i mass tending towards bearingoffset which equals to 60,0,1,0,0,0,0
240,45 seems decent lower if we would need to actually reduce car mass,0,1,0,0,0,0
241,alright so what factorofsafety s why are you getting towards my priority lowest the factorofsafety situation that is still 323,0,0,0,0,1,0
242,based completely on my simulations it therefore seems like sometimes a smaller value than of bearingoffset data will result in an equivalent overall significantly higher factorofsafety do you still agree?,0,1,0,0,0,0

245,it affects the design variable bearingoffset which the length of radius the the bearing ball support cannot offset,0,0,1,0,0,0
246,that only depends on what the initial thickness of the piston size is for me if so i keep raising it about the same and decrease it so the mass goes halfway down but so does the factor thus of safety i mass trying to get it at around 2 w lowest mass,0,1,0,0,0,0

248,yes... but i mass iterating to precisely determine dependence based on various other parameters rn,0,1,0,0,0,0
249,so does increasing only the flywheel thickness increase or substantially decrease bearingoffset?,1,0,0,0,0,0
250,however if you we could also reduce your flywheelthickness to variable that would be great :,0,0,1,0,0,0
251,that that is what my document specifies today i will keep bearingoffset low all unless anything the piston needs believe it right to be higher,1,0,0,0,0,0

426,i broadcasted a change to then lower my mass factorofsafety as is actually still above 2 × 0 i briefly saw about that after delivering this message so sorry about my not telling you it before,0,0,0,0,1,0
427,my mass is increasingly lowered and thus my risk factorofsafety is just way above 2,0,0,0,1,0,0
428,i actually dropped back my mass by 0 02,0,0,0,1,0,0
429,what... s your mass greater than,0,0,0,1,0,0
430,does the changing any other s phase parameters possible help bring your mass down?,0,1,0,0,0,0
431,what s keeping the piston bore factor from being minimized up to about 75 if i may ask? actually i do think we were only hitting an excellent design rating even when it was still at 75 earlier,1,0,0,0,0,0
432,try not and minimize your mass but they keep their factorofsafety height above 2,0,0,0,0,0,1
433,hey hey sweetheart what mass are you getting?,0,0,0,1,0,0
434,cool as can you get with your mass any lower?,0,0,0,1,0,0
435,try anything and minimize all your mass but also keep factorofsafety level above 2,0,0,0,0,0,1
436,i am trying this but it only lowers nearly my factorofsafety as things well but i ll see if i actually can mentally do anything furhter,0,0,0,0,0,1
437,just lowered it down another 2 lbs,0,0,0,0,0,1
438,currently it is at a 75 though,1,0,0,0,0,0
439,i can increase weight by of 1 1 pound now and factorofsafety also goes speeding up again by by 1 which is a sad lot can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small overall decrease rate in factorofsafety?,0,0,0,0,0,1
440,if someone just broadcasted this somethhing is different and raised our mass to 3 at 25,0,0,0,1,0,0
441,its at 2 83 mm rn for us me,0,0,0,1,0,0
442,what can you see if all you increase from your bore of diamater to 41 levels or 42 as if it improves anything?,0,1,0,0,0,0
443,i am probably trying my hardest... what species would your current factorofsafety be replaced with... that change? we only want it to be something above 2,0,0,0,1,0,0
444,9 1 38,0,0,0,1,0,0
445,thats as the low as ever i have gotten it,0,0,0,1,0,0
446,hey looks like since our psi factorofsafety went back up what actually changed?,0,0,0,1,0,0
447,i also have mine with half the factorofsafety closest to just 2 mb and lowest mass density i can get,0,0,0,0,1,0
448,i don t exactly think creating that one was all my intention doing i have been seen broadcasting factorofsafety values around 8,0,0,0,1,0,0
449,take any way you can decrease mass,0,0,0,0,0,1
450,stop it changing,0,0,0,1,0,0
451,we are at this excellent agian,0,0,0,1,0,0
452,flywheel changed a value now and i once lost 5 lbs lbs,0,1,0,0,0,0
453,now i have decreased my weight parameter a bit,0,1,0,0,0,0
454,bearingoffset equals 1 to 0 60 pa dc equals to 15,1,0,0,0,0,0
455,now hey i need to know what double piston stroke bore diameter you are finally planning to use for making my calculations,0,0,1,0,0,0
