my flywheel also normally depends on your crankshaft gear bearing with offset on bearingoffset,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
hey i too am the chief conrod i just was curious as to what measure you originally thought a truly good piston diameter would be?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
section 45 seems decent,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
on how does how the flywheel thickness will factor back into the bearing support offset weight and crankshaft mass?,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
my valve design depends on the ideal piston diameter then what happens so if you decrease it?,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
increasing back the value distribution of a bearingoffset presents two similar adverse cases where mine mass increases substantially and my factorofsafety decreases so as i mass tending towards bearingoffset which equals to 60,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
45 seems decent lower if we would need to actually reduce car mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
alright so what factorofsafety s why are you getting towards my priority lowest the factorofsafety situation that is still 323,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
based completely on my simulations it therefore seems like sometimes a smaller value than of bearingoffset data will result in an equivalent overall significantly higher factorofsafety do you still agree?,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
7 96 has also been the best achieved thus time far,Monitoring_objective_values
based on mean bearingoffset of equals to 60?,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it affects the design variable bearingoffset which the length of radius the the bearing ball support cannot offset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
that only depends on what the initial thickness of the piston size is for me if so i keep raising it about the same and decrease it so the mass goes halfway down but so does the factor thus of safety i mass trying to get it at around 2 w lowest mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing this bearingoffset increases the mass and it decreases finally the gross factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yes... but i mass iterating to precisely determine dependence based on various other parameters rn,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so does increasing only the flywheel thickness increase or substantially decrease bearingoffset?,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
however if you we could also reduce your flywheelthickness to variable that would be great :,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
that that is what my document specifies today i will keep bearingoffset low all unless anything the piston needs believe it right to be higher,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
alright... factorofsafety also increases with increasing df so rn if i have it probably minimized but what can increase if needed,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

what does changing that button do?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
because yeah but 45 should be perfectly fine if you dont want people to let go lower,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
but if it ′ s but important increasing flywheelthickness increases mass flow but decreases power factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
not much as it doesn t really help do anything to eliminate the factor of safety but it also brings the mass back down,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
right near now it says we have an particularly excellent design,Monitoring_objective_values
and i don't totally think it has any effect,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
some just reduced thickness to help reduce mass increased internal factorofsafety a little bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i so can probably drop some mass out of my part center but i can also take only that out because of other parts,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
therefore the total mass was also 0 24 with the diameter at 70 rpm but with the diameter at level 45 it all was 0 17,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
