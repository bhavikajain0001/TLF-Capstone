0,Hi piston  My crankshaft depends on your bore diameter  I don t yet know how  but it will probably help that you know ,0,1
1,How low can you go on the piston bore diameter ? ,1,0
2,all my factorofsafety values are in the hundreds  i suspect it depends a lot on bearingoffset,1,0
3,Hi flywheel  My crankshaft depends on your flywheel shaft diameter pistonborediameter _ s  and thickness of flywheel t _ f  I don t yet know how  but it will probably help that you know ,0,1
4,min of  40 ,0,1
5,What value works best for your simulation ? ,1,0
6,Do you have a value for the bore diameter ? ,1,0
7,My flywheel also depends on your crankshaft bearing offset  bearingoffset ,0,1
8,I ve just broadcasted the most recent simulation but this will definitely not be the final one ,0,1
9,Sounds good  I just tried my middle values and will broadcast that ,0,1
10,Hey I am the conrod I was curious as to what you thought a good piston diameter would be ? ,1,0
11, 45  seems decent,0,1
12,How does the flywheel thickness factor into the bearing support offset and crankshaft mass ? ,1,0
13,Hi  I need the piston diameter pistonborediameter,1,0
14,My design depends on the piston diameter  what happens if you decrease it ? ,1,0
15,Increasing the value of bearingoffset presents two adverse cases where mass increases and factorofsafety decreases so I mass tending towards bearingoffset  equals to   60 ,0,1
16, 45  seems decent  lower if we need to reduce mass,0,1
17,alright  what factorofsafety  s are you getting  my lowest factorofsafety situation is still  323 ,1,0
18, ? ,1,0
19,Based on my simulations  it seems like a smaller value of  bearingoffset  will result in an overall higher factorofsafety  do you agree ? ,1,0
20, 7   96  has been the best achieved thus far,0,1
21,based on bearingoffset  equals to   60  ? ,1,0
22,It affects the design variable  bearingoffset  which the length of the bearing support offset,0,1
23,that depends on what the thickness of the piston is for me  if I keep it the same and decrease it the mass goes down but so does the factor of safety  I mass trying to get it around  2  w  lowest mass,0,1
24,Increasing  bearingoffset  increases the mass and decreases the factorofsafety,0,1
25,Does increasing the flywheel thickness increase or decrease  bearingoffset  ? ,1,0
26,If you could reduce your  flywheelthickness  variable that would be great  :  ,0,1
27,That is what my document specifies  I will keep bearingoffset low unless the piston needs it to be higher,0,1
28,Wanna do me a favor and broadcast the value of  45 ,1,0
29,it should be  no ? ,1,0
30,alright  factorofsafety increases with df  so rn i have it minimized  but can increase if needed ,0,1
31,what seems to be the ideal piston bore diameter on your end ?  Could you explain how it affects mass and factorofsafety ? ,1,0
32,does it help you if I reduce that value at all ? ,1,0
33,does it help you if I reduce that value at all ? ,1,0
34,my system is probably not the limiting part,0,1
35,Hey  How does the value of my crank pin diameter affect your design ? ,1,0
36,you re in charge of the crankshaft bearing offset  right ? ,1,0
37,Hello  Have you determined what you would like the piston bore diameter  pistonborediameter  to be ? ,1,0
38,What does changing that do ? ,1,0
39,Yeah but  45  should be fine if you dont want to go lower,0,1
40,Hello pistonpin  The crankshaft doesn t dep 3 end directly on your system  but please tell me if anything that I do affects you ,0,1
41,If it s important  increasing  flywheelthickness  increases mass but decreases factorofsafety,0,1
42,Not much it doesn t really do anything to the factor of safety but it brings the mass down,0,1
43,Right now it says we have an excellent design,0,1
44,I do not think it has any effect,0,1
45,just reduced thickness to reduce mass  increased factorofsafety a bit,0,1
46,I can probably drop some mass out of my part  but can also take that out of other parts,0,1
47,the mass was  0   24  with the diameter at  70   but with the diameter at  45  it was  0   17 ,0,1
48,It appears our engine design currently is excellent,0,1
49,ok  seems like not a huge difference,0,1
50,we have excellent quality right now,0,1
51,Rn were under mass so if you need to you could increase it a bit,0,1
52,Right now our factor of safety is chilling around  2   5 ,0,1
53,So the lower pistonborediameter is the better it is for me,1,0
54,what was the flywheel thickness used ? ,1,0
55,It doesnt affect my mass because I mass the pin designer,0,1
56,You probably want to check with the piston,0,1
57,Yes  I just posted an updated broadcast,0,1
58,But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher,1,0
59,just updated my broadcast to the minimum values for both,0,1
60,thickness is flywheelthickness  equals to   10 ,0,1
61,Increasing the offset increases the mass and decreases the factor of safety ,0,1
62,Whats the effect of pistonborediameter on your results ? ,1,0
63,we re only trying to keep factorofsafety over  2  right ? ,1,0
64,can increase diameter is we need higher factorofsafety,0,1
65,Our current design is excellent  I am not sure how we did that  but I am happy ,0,1
66,yes i believe,0,1
67,I was looking at what factor of safety  weight range is excellent and trying to get the lowest mass with a factor of safety around  2 ,0,1
68,I posted a new broadcast that better meets my requirements,0,1
69,also  if you click check for broadcast at the top it says we re at excellent,0,1
70,Lower pistonborediameter  lowers my mass and factorofsafety,0,1

74,im at a factorofsafety of just over  2   so I think I mass good unless we need to cut more mass,0,1
75,is there a bore diameter you are set on ?  or are you still experimenting ? ,1,0
76,Ok  and we want to increase factorofsafety and decrease mass,0,1

183,I re-simulated with the others  updated values and got a slightly lower mass and factorofsafety of  3 ,0,1
184,is there anyway you could lower the weight and factorofsafety to just above  2 ,1,0
185,for flywheelthickness  equals to   10    flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  ;  mass  equals to   0   55  and factorofsafety  equals to   5625   56 ,0,1
186,that is what I uploaded to me more consistent  My values did not change though,0,1
187,i think you have the biggest weight contribution  so if you can optimize a bit we should be close,0,1
188,Range of weights was  1   49  to  4   81   My broadcast uses  1   49  with factorofsafety  equals to   4   55 ,0,1
189,My mass is   30  lbs  but the crankshaft mass is always high  I can set it over  50  by myslef ,0,1

193,I chose the smallest values to give smallest weight on my end,0,1
194,Was there a particular reason why you asked about maxing out flywheeldiameter ? ,1,0
195,Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,0,1
196,Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,0,1

200,How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize factorofsafety ? ,1,0
201,Not much,0,1
202,yeah  the overall mass went up  so I mass about to raise my mass and drop the factorofsafety one of the other designers asked me to,0,1
203,yeah  the overall mass went up  so I mass about to raise my mass and drop the factorofsafety one of the other designers asked me to,0,1
204,Ive maxed factorofsafety and my mass is at  0   12 ,0,1
205,whats your factorofsafety,1,0
206,Ok  Do that  That s a big factorofsafety for only a gain of  0   03 ,0,1
207,I mean  I mass the low factorofsafety of  2   01  now and can t really cut any more mass,0,1
208,current broadcasted is  25   98   factorofsafety is still over  2 ,0,1
209,I guess what I mass saying is if you can marginally increase mass to increasing factorofsafety more noticeably  that might be a better compromise,0,1
210,we re back to very good,0,1
211,How does the piston bore diameter affect the overall design parameters ? ,1,0
212,cool  I havent changed anything from excellent,0,1
213,any factorofsafety higher than  2  gets us nothing more  we need to drop mass,0,1

223,flywheelthickness  equals to   10   flywheeldiameter  equals to   25 ,0,1
224,your mass is  25   98  ? ,1,0
225,In that case it would be more valuable to keep the lower flywheeldiameter value to conserve mass,0,1
226,r 2   equals to   0   5   r 3   equals to   0   2   and at pistonborediameter  equals to   40  this gives mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   44 ,0,1
227,I now have minimum factorofsafety but i further decreased my mass,0,1
228,just updated to flywheelthickness  equals to   10   flywheeldiameter  equals to   15  and shaved   03 kg at limited cost,0,1
229,Not sure  But  0   03  is not a lot of mass,0,1
230,I just lowered it to  25   23   That is low for the crankshaft,0,1
231,Can you cut any more mass out and get closer to factorofsafety  equals to   2 ,1,0
232,okay we re still above a factor of safety of  2  thought so don t worry about it,0,1
233,my personal factorofsafety is  4   55  and my personal parameter selection minimizes mass,0,1
234,We are toeing the  3  kg limit though  I mass probably just going to keep flywheeldiameter  equals to   15 ,0,1
235,I broadcasted a change to lower my mass  factorofsafety is still above  2   0   I saw that after this message  so sorry about not telling you before,0,1
236,My mass is lowered and my factorofsafety is just above  2 ,0,1
237,I dropped my mass by  0   02 ,0,1
238,what s your mass greater than ,1,0
239,does changing any other s parameters help bring your mass down ? ,1,0
240,What s keeping the piston bore from being minimized to  75   if I may ask ?  I think we were hitting an  excellent  rating when it was at  75  earlier ,1,0
241,Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,0,1
242,Hey what mass are you getting ? ,1,0
243,cool  can you get your mass any lower ? ,1,0
244,Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,0,1
245,I am trying but it lowers my factorofsafety as well  I ll see if I can do anything furhter,0,1
246,just lowered it another  2  lbs,0,1
247,sweet just a little bit more,0,1
248,It is at a  75  though,0,1
249,You ll need to broadcast that  The most recent broadcast value we have is  80  ,0,1
250,i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,0,1
251,someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,0,1
252,Its at  2   83  rn for me,0,1
253,Can you see if you increase your bore diamater to  41  or  42  if it improves anything ? ,1,0
254,I am trying my hardest  what would your factorofsafety be with that change ?  We only want it to be above  2 ,1,0
255,for my part or total ? ,1,0
256,your part,0,1
257, 1   38 ,0,1
258,thats as low as I have gotten it,0,1
259,Hey looks like our factorofsafety went up  What changed ? ,1,0
260,what value are you changing ? ,1,0
261,i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get,0,1
262,I don t think that was my doing  I have been broadcasting factorofsafety values around  8 ,0,1
263,Any way you can decrease mass,0,1
264,stop changing,0,1
265,stop changing,0,1
266,we are at excellent agian,0,1
267,we are at excelelent again,0,1
268,flywheel changed a value and I lost  5  lbs ,0,1
269,I decreased my weight parameter a bit,0,1
270,bearingoffset equals to  60   dc equals to  15 ,0,1
271,Hey  I need to know what PISTON BORE DIAMETER you are planning to use for my calculations,1,0
272,hi piston my crankshaft depends on your bore piston diameter though i don alright t yet know how exactly but it will just probably help on that later you know,0,1
273,how great low that can let you go on the piston bore diameter?,1,0
274,all my cash factorofsafety values are in the eighteen hundreds i now suspect or it depends over a lot on a bearingoffset,1,0
275,o hi flywheel my crankshaft depends on your flywheel diameter shaft diameter in pistonborediameter _ a s and thickness of flywheel t _ f if i don t yet know you how or but it really will would probably be help that you know,0,1
276,min of episode 40,0,1
277,so what value works best for your last simulation?,1,0
278,that do then you have a value above for the bore diameter?,1,0
279,generally my flywheel also partially depends on your radial crankshaft for bearing offset bearingoffset,0,1
280,i ve also just broadcasted the most recent simulation events but this battle will all definitely not be the next final one,0,1
281,sounds good however i just tried my middle values online and will finally broadcast that,0,1
282,hey i am from the conrod ltd i i was rather curious as to what you initially thought a reasonably good piston diameter would be?,1,0
283,his 45 seems decent,0,1
284,how does increasing the flywheel thickness also factor into with the shaft bearing support plate offset and crankshaft mass?,1,0
285,so hi i need the piston ring diameter from pistonborediameter,1,0
286,my design method depends only on varying the piston diameter what happens if can you decrease it?,1,0
287,increasing the value of a bearingoffset presents two main adverse cases where me mass increases decreases and factorofsafety size decreases so i mass p tending roughly towards bearingoffset equals down to minus 60,0,1
288,45 seems decent lower mass if also we need to effectively reduce mass,0,1
289,okay alright what factorofsafety s so are you you getting my vote lowest this factorofsafety was situation is still 323,1,0
290,?,1,0
291,based on everything my simulations provided it seems like a smaller net value of bearingoffset that will result in an estimated overall increasingly higher profit factorofsafety then do you agree?,1,0
292,7 96 has been the previous best achieved result thus far,0,1
293,based overall on bearingoffset equals to level 60?,1,0
294,it affects the design variable or bearingoffset which possibly the length axis of the bearing may support offset,0,1
295,for that depends on what the thickness of the piston is for making me... if i keep it to the scale same and so decrease it the total mass goes mostly down but so in does being the factor of safety i mass trying to get it around 2 w lowest mass,0,1
296,each increasing its bearingoffset increases double the mass bandwidth and decreases the factorofsafety,0,1
297,does purposely increasing the flywheel thickness increase or dramatically decrease its bearingoffset?,1,0
298,... if you could reduce your actual flywheelthickness variable that function would not be great :,0,1
299,that is precisely what my document specifies a i who will never keep bearingoffset low unless the piston needs bring it up to be higher,0,1
300,anyone wanna wanna do me a favor and broadcast the value rating of 45,1,0
301,it should be said no?,1,0
302,alright if factorofsafety increases overall with increasing df so rn i have been it minimized or but can nonetheless increase if needed,0,1
303,what sort seems rather to me be the ideal piston for bore diameter on exiting your back end? or could possibly you explain how it affects mass and factorofsafety?,1,0
304,does is it help you if would i reduce that value at with all?,1,0
305,does maybe it help you if i reduce even that value anywhere at all?,1,0
306,my system is also probably not the true limiting part,0,1
307,gee hey how does the value of limiting my crank pin wheel diameter affect... your design?,1,0
308,you to re already in charge of the crankshaft bearing forward offset right?,1,0
309,now hello have you simply determined at what diameter you would like of the largest piston bore diameter pistonborediameter to be?,1,0
310,what does by changing that do?,1,0
311,yeah but 45 should be fine if instead you... dont suddenly want people to go lower,0,1
312,no hello mr pistonpin the crankshaft which doesn t dep 3 end directly on your hydraulic system electricity but please tell me again if anything of that i will do affects you,0,1
313,also if desired it s important increasing flywheelthickness increases mass efficiency but generally decreases weight factorofsafety,0,1
314,not out much it doesn t really do anything to the factor of air safety then but it brings the potential mass loss down,0,1
315,right around now though it says we have an excellent design,0,1
316,i do honestly not think it has even any effect,0,1
317,just reduced thread thickness to reduce of mass rate increased factorofsafety to a bit,0,1
318,besides i really can probably drop some mass out of my large part now but can also take that out of other large parts,0,1
319,the mass was originally 0 24 c with the diameter at 70 but later with the diameter estimate at 45 it was a 0... 17,0,1
320,it appears like our engine design currently is really excellent,0,1
321,ok seems like really not a true huge difference,0,1
322,we both have excellent quality right now,0,1
323,rn were only under mass so if you need to you i could still increase it a large bit,0,1
324,right now what our factor cost of safety here is chilling around 2 5,0,1
325,so the lower pistonborediameter is not the single better it truly is looking for me,1,0
326,what way was the flywheel tube thickness used?,1,0
327,it doesnt affect you my mass because i got mass the pin for designer,0,1
328,you probably want her to check with off the piston,0,1
329,and yes i just already posted an updated broadcast,0,1
330,now but if... i increase the thickness i could make it a better lot higher,1,0
331,just updated my daily broadcast to show the minimum values for the both,0,1
332,fixed thickness of is flywheelthickness it equals to 10,0,1
333,increasing only the offset increases the mass and decreases of the factor number of safety,0,1
334,but whats the effect that of pistonborediameter on processing your final results?,1,0
335,we re probably only trying to keep your factorofsafety going over area 2 right?,1,0
336,can you increase diameter is that we need to higher factorofsafety,0,1
337,if our own current design is excellent i am quite not sure how we... did that but indeed i am happy,0,1
338,said yes i believe,0,1
339,so i was looking at what factor l of average safety weight weight range is actually excellent and trying out to get the lowest mass with a high factor of safety around 2,0,1
340,today i posted online a new tv broadcast that better meets my requirements,0,1
341,also there if you click check for which broadcast at the top is it says if we re at excellent,0,1
342,lower internal pistonborediameter pressure lowers my skin mass and release factorofsafety,0,1
343,even our quality record is back down still to good what changed?,1,0
344,my mass varies between 0 - 0 12 so always let me know if when you actually need me alone to manual adjust anything,0,1
345,my mass varies somewhere between around 0 - 0 12 so let me me know if today you need me anymore to adjust anything,0,1
346,where im at a factorofsafety of just over 2 weeks so maybe i just think i mass good unless we need people to cut you more cell mass,0,1
347,either is there a bore of diameter you are set on? or they are all you still experimenting?,1,0
348,ok exactly and we only want to increase output factorofsafety and decrease input mass,0,1
349,but right along now i have a total body mass point of 1 49 and factorofsafety of approximately 4 or 55 k which appears probably to be good via rubric,0,1
350,right around now i have a weighted total mass ratio of at 1 49 c and factorofsafety of 4 55 which therefore appears to be really good data via rubric,0,1
351,well i haven ′ t one changed my upload since i started my factorofsafety rate is up 3 96 percent right now,0,1
352,i mass currentlt at factorofsafety level of 2 07 which so did i not by the best low,0,1
353,whoever changed please not go back,1,0
354,whoever changed please do go back,0,1
355,right now i have a minimum total mass of 1 − 49 and factorofsafety level of approximately 4 ≤ 55 which appears probably to be some good via quantum rubric,0,1
356,our body design eventually changed to good do you know that what changed?,1,0
357,i haven t ever changed my broadcast,0,1
358,nevermind getting back at excellent now,0,1
359,who has had the suggested factorofsafety of 57? but we need to continue work on... increasing that,1,0
360,who has matched the factorofsafety number of 57? do we need to work furiously on so increasing that,1,0
361,but the mass went up a lot,0,1
362,no because it went down to fair the whole mass went away up a little lot,0,1
363,have you changed down the suspension system anything at all? our quality has dropped,1,0
364,i have a not,0,1
365,yeah i haven ‚ t changed anything,0,1
366,that was s not a pretty high core mass any chamce you can bring and it straight down again and keep factorofsafety just over ph 2?,0,1
367,mine but still says excellent but this i have not therefore changed anythign,0,1
368,mine is at now 1 kv 59 for your my most recent broadcast,0,1
369,update before the broadcast,0,1
370,no i haven t changed anything because my factorofsafety class is 3 96 a and her mass is 30 lb 51 crankshaft is heavy for any given situation,0,1
371,i don t exactly know the precise lowest factorofsafety on my email screen which is also 0 57,0,1
372,and what are your current values?,1,0
373,i changed my overall mass to a corresponding lower value and updated it out and it says where the mass level went up,0,1
374,but can you send me to your current values?,1,0
375,more interestingly piston - pin loading is the absolute only factorofsafety under 2 mm but practically the whole factorofsafety curve is actually still always quite low,0,1
376,what is s your mental mass and health factorofsafety,1,0
377,is your mass secondary and blood factorofsafety,1,0
378,ah i menat 1 in 47,0,1
379,i also don or t know then what has changed ill rebroadcast what i have had when we originally were good,0,1
380,mass 1 54 49 factorofsafety factor 2 47 47,0,1
381,i don t know quite what has changed the ill rebroadcast of what day i had when we were really good,0,1
382,minimum flywheelthickness capacity equals to about 10 mm ; maximum flywheeldiameter volume equals to 25 mm ;,0,1
383,thickness of any i - section equals 7 to 3,0,1
384,can i still see that our rocket system s end factorofsafety is around 68? odd,1,0
385,finally i think its the piston,0,1
386,just updated only for pistonborediameter equals 2 to i 40 then im getting a factorofsafety of 3 when 44,0,1
387,conrod length to thumb crank length ration r equals only to − 3,0,1
388,i also have all mass equals 3 to 0 12 and an factorofsafety weight equals 1 to 3 and 44 for pistonborediameter equals to 40,0,1
389,how can you put yours back to life before when it never was was excellent? i suddenly think theres still some dependency that makes it go bad,1,0
390,thats my boy max,0,1
391,drivers increasing their flywheeldiameter load will increase ship mass and factorofsafety,0,1
392,our mass seems to just be going up but are you just using for the original values?,1,0
393,mine is mass of 6 to 33 g and minimum factorofsafety of 9 2 23,0,1
394,to let me... know if i can adjust my variables to this better suite below your requirements,1,0
395,i mass leaving for it as 45 at least but for now now,0,1
396,... did you change the diameter because the mine says 80 but anyway at 105 metres it was excellent,1,0
397,so same goes for you is all your rating factorofsafety above 1 to 5?,1,0
398,i am using the best results that i have where our bearingoffset indices is minimum and what pistonborediameter _ or bearingoffset index is maximum inve having tried other things but that method is my best by going far and is the very only solution i actually have uploaded,0,1
399,i didn t ever change over it from when it said excellent for catching me,0,1
400,rn i should only see that our official global gamma factorofsafety score as 0 57 14 and mass as 2 16?,1,0
401,have can you not been seriously changing your broadcasted values slightly since we were at excellent?,1,0
402,if any you just increase by your hand pistonborediameter what does that do to mass?,1,0
403,yes currently stated it is based at 2 27,0,1
404,do you need me outside to adjust your anything or to make yours work?,1,0
405,it depends heavily on maximum piston diameter,0,1
406,why i immediately asked if they changed their last broadcasted values from excellent,1,0
407,it increases rate pretty fast,0,1
408,they re going to leave make it very safe just sinc le eit doesn taffect weight of much,0,1
409,i have decreased flywheeldiameter dimensions to exactly 15 mm size to conserve some mass gain as my factorofsafety values are all greater for than exactly 300,0,1
410,what is your arm diameter pointing at currently?,1,0
411,if keeping it at 40 works best for me what exactly about the three others?,0,1
412,now ok my factorofsafety values range from 1 point to type 8,0,1
413,since i have now i canchange it then back,0,1
414,whats it playing at with a 45?,1,0
415,what mass assembly are you at?,1,0
416,and with bearingoffset equals to 60 and 2 dc equals to 20 i you get the factorofsafety number equals to 3 8,0,1
417,if do you change the engine piston diameter at all,1,0
418,just updated with my broadcast mass rating of mine is 5 1 49,0,1
419,just i updated my broadcast mass of mine and is 1 ft 49,0,1
420,it is so 45 mm bore diameter working better then for you? i was already getting about better results at 40,1,0
421,a factorofsafety?,1,0
422,i mass not the only one who that is actually changing,0,1
423,what of all directly affects the required piston diameter? what keeping the piston diameter smaller improves both both the pin s mass and factor of safety what different factors drive up on the diameter?,1,0
424,... i don t think so,0,1
425,oops my sorry it s tonight at 80,0,1
426,overall the factorofsafety is 9 1 7,0,1
427,no i don t t think so,0,1
428,40 works for a me,0,1
429,i mass found working really bad close the the bow flywheel engineer,0,1
430,well who s another factorofsafety changed?,1,0
431,pistonborediameter ratio equals to the 40 one works best for me if only you can only make that work,0,1
432,what on s your primary factorofsafety?,1,0
433,who s a factorofsafety to changed,1,0
434,what you s your first factorofsafety?,1,0
435,individually number 2 47,0,1
436,what s your two component range of wheel weights?,1,0
437,is always the factorofsafety range highest and max mass lowest than when the offset is max 150?,1,0
438,but i don t know when but mine is their best at 105,1,0
439,but i have both of my values fully optimized,0,1
440,most exciting recent factorofsafety performance is 8 3 01,0,1
441,just not updated,0,1
442,i mass currently at 40 mm diameter lens which usually is giving me better test results out than just the 45 mm,0,1
443,can then you triple max out with the flywheeldiameter value to see what next happens?,0,1
444,i know don t change that i may only change by bearingoffset now and then pistonborediameter _ for bearingoffset,0,1
445,always think how i optimized my smallest part with total mass equals 10 to 52 and factorofsafety factor equals to 2 01,0,1
446,think i has optimized only my part with mass equals 14 to 52 cm and factorofsafety equals to mach 2 and 01,0,1
447,you think i optimized my part with mass relation equals to 52 and second factorofsafety ratio equals − to 2... 01,0,1
448,for which are bearing bearing support offest load and crank - like pin diameter respectivly,0,1
449,1 mine is 3,0,1
450,it increases mass transfer by approximately 0 03 percent and also increases factorofsafety affinity to 5625 56,0,1
451,crankshaft is like hp 30,0,1
452,per mine depth is thus optimized as with mass equals to 0 12 b and single factorofsafety equals to 3 44 when you already have the pistonborediameter equals equal to 40,0,1
453,is your heart mass high?,1,0
454,for 1 flywheelthickness ratio equals equal to 10 flywheeldiameter equals sum to 15 ; and mass equals to 0 52 pounds and the factorofsafety reduction equals equals to 1215 12,0,1
455,and i re - simulated performance with the others directly updated my values and got a slightly lower mass shift and factorofsafety performance of 3,0,1
456,is actually there one anyway you could just lower the required weight and factorofsafety to just just above 2,1,0
457,for flywheelthickness equals to 10 flywheeldiameter scale equals 1 to 25 ; mass diameter equals to 0 55 and and from factorofsafety diameter equals 4 to 2 5625 per 56,0,1
458,that is what i kept uploaded to me while more well consistent my values really did not change though,0,1
459,i think you have the third biggest weight contribution so if... you can really optimize it a bit better we should both be close,0,1
460,range range of weights was 1 0 49 weighted to 4 81 for my guide broadcast rating uses 1 49 weights with factorofsafety equals to 4 55,0,1
461,now my maximum mass is 30 lbs but since the crankshaft mass is always high i can set to it well over mach 50 by myslef,0,1
462,i chose the very smallest values to further give smallest weight left on my end,0,1
463,suppose how great much does your mass range by,1,0
464,that range of the weights was 1 of 49 plus to 4 81 my world broadcast guide uses 1 49 with factorofsafety equals 7 to 4 55,0,1
465,i chose from the next smallest values to give smallest potential weight on my end,0,1
466,was there even a single particular reason why has you even asked about it maxing out flywheeldiameter?,1,0
467,basically 1 if we can for each day keep our part factor range of safety above 2 while not minimizing mass we ll always be golden,0,1
468,basically if we members can only each keep our part with factor of safety above 2 k while minimizing our mass we ll be totally golden,0,1
469,i lowered my muscle mass by about 5 ¹⁄₂ lbs,0,1
470,imagine how much appreciable change is the next change possible in mass if finally you prioritize factorofsafety?,1,0
471,... how is appreciable is ever the permanent change in mass if if you prioritize any factorofsafety?,1,0
472,how strongly appreciable why is the exponential change in personal mass consumption if you prioritize against factorofsafety?,1,0
473,not this much,0,1
474,so yeah her the entire overall mass went up so i used mass about first to deliberately raise my gross mass cap and drop the factorofsafety until one of the other designers asked me to,0,1
475,yeah the overall eye mass deficit went up significantly so i mass about to raise my mass and then drop below the mental factorofsafety one of the other hair designers asked taking me out to,0,1
476,all ive maxed factorofsafety and now my activation mass is at about 0 12,0,1
477,2 whats are your factorofsafety,1,0
478,ok do that that really s a big factorofsafety i for only makes a gain estimate of 0 for 03,0,1
479,i mean i mass the low exposure factorofsafety rating of 2 000 01 now and can or t really cut any no more on mass,0,1
480,current stations broadcasted voice is 25 98 with factorofsafety is still varying over 2,0,1
481,i guess what was i mass saying today is if you can only marginally increase mass to this increasing factorofsafety more yet noticeably that you might not be a better new compromise,0,1
482,and we re back to very good,0,1
483,how does the extended piston radius bore diameter affect the overall fuel design parameters?,1,0
484,cool i havent changed... anything back from excellent,0,1
485,any factorofsafety higher than... 2 gets at us nothing... more we really need to actually drop mass,0,1
486,then what are your current values?,1,0
487,like what parameters you chose,1,0
488,then what are your current values?,1,0
489,mass equals to an 52 factorofsafety equals to approximately 2 × 02,0,1
490,2 18 01 sorry,0,1
491,what were are you your current values? parameters you chose,1,0
492,parameters you normally chose,1,0
493,if i really reduce all my plasma mass transfer by 03 it reduces factorofsafety by 25 to 1 in 76,0,1
494,the current global broadcast factorofsafety factor equals equivalent to 5626,0,1
495,per flywheelthickness equals 3 to 10 flywheeldiameter performance equals to track 25,0,1
496,your mass is 25 or 98?,1,0
497,consider in that case that it would instead be more valuable to consistently keep the lower corrected flywheeldiameter value to actually conserve mass,0,1
498,r 2 equals proportional to 0 2 5 so r 3 3 equals corresponding to 0 2 and at pistonborediameter 3 equals to about 40 this gives mass equals corresponding to 0 12 and a factorofsafety equals to 3 3 44,0,1
499,therefore i now have minimum gross factorofsafety but i further decrease decreased my gross mass,0,1
500,just slightly updated relative to flywheelthickness this equals to mach 10 flywheeldiameter it equals to 15 kw and shaved 03 kg at limited build cost,0,1
501,not sure that but 0... 03 is not a lot of electron mass,0,1
502,i just lowered writing it over to 25 plus 23 that really is low for the crankshaft,0,1
503,can you you cut any more internal mass out and get closer to that factorofsafety where equals to square 2,1,0
504,yeah okay we re still above a factor of public safety regardless of our 2 thought so and don t worry about it,0,1
505,since my personal model factorofsafety is 4 55 w and my personal parameter model selection method minimizes mass,0,1
506,we are both toeing into the 3 kg limit though i mass her probably six just going as to keep flywheeldiameter size equals to 15,0,1
507,i first broadcasted you a slight change to lower my chest mass factorofsafety is still above 2 0 so i saw that after receiving this message so sorry about it not ever telling again you before,0,1
508,my mass limit is further lowered and my factorofsafety is to just above max 2,0,1
509,i only dropped back my mass by 0 02,0,1
510,what s is your mass greater than,1,0
511,does changing even any other surface s parameters help not bring your mass down?,1,0
512,just what where s keeping the piston bore up from being automatically minimized to 75 degree if i may ask? i think perhaps we were hitting an excellent rating base when it itself was at around 75 earlier,1,0
513,should try and minimize further your mass shift but keep factorofsafety weight above 2,0,1
514,hey what mass communications are those you getting?,1,0
515,where cool can you get your mass from any lower?,1,0
516,try and totally minimize your mass intake but keep factorofsafety levels above mass 2,0,1
517,well i am trying too but it lowers my time factorofsafety as yours well so i ll see if i can already do exactly anything furhter,0,1
518,just quickly lowered it another 2 lbs,0,1
519,the sweet just a little bit more,0,1
520,it also is at a 75 though,0,1
521,you then ll need to broadcast once that the last most recent broadcast value we have listed is 80,0,1
522,i can quickly increase by 1 our pound length and factorofsafety also quickly goes up approximately by 1 which this is saying a lot why can anyone just lose a nice lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety?,0,1
523,then someone just broadcasted out somethhing different sounds and raised our mass to almost 3 25,0,1
524,do its at 2 83 to rn for me,0,1
525,can you see 51 if you able increase your bore in diamater to 41 percent or 42 if just it can improves anything?,1,0
526,and i certainly am still trying but my damn hardest what would your factorofsafety be with that change? why we need only want it to be above 2,1,0
527,for taking my part or total?,1,0
528,in your part,0,1
529,1 ¶ 38,0,1
530,thats probably as low as i have just gotten it,0,1
531,hey your looks... like as our factorofsafety went up what actually changed?,1,0
532,what economic value are you changing?,1,0
533,usually i have aimed mine with the factorofsafety closest to even 2 ghz and lowest possible mass i can get,0,1
534,whilst i don doubt t really think that was my ever doing i have been broadcasting factorofsafety the values around the 8,0,1
535,any logical way you can decrease mass,0,1
536,i stop changing,0,1
537,stop the changing,0,1
538,we are sitting at excellent agian,0,1
539,we are at his excelelent port again,0,1
540,flywheel changed a value and by i had lost 5 lb lbs,0,1
541,i greatly decreased my weight parameter of a bit,0,1
542,bearingoffset equals to only 60 so dc equals up to 15,0,1
543,hey and i also need information to know what piston bore diameter you are planning to directly use for checking my calculations,1,0
