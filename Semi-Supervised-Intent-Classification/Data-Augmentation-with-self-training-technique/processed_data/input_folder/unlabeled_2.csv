56,we have excellent quality right now
57,Have you broadcasted your most recent design ? 
58,we have excellent quality right now
65,looks like we re done ? 
68,seems like it
69,Hello piston  based on my information  it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and maximize flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  Does this work with your design requirements ? 
74,ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? 
76,ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? 
78,ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? 
80,Yes  my most recent design is what is broadcasted
87,It looks like our engine design is excellent then  And yes that works with my design requirements
88,I mass still seeing  poor  on my end
91,oh wait no
95,don t know if we can stop or if we have to go the full  45  minutes
98,yeah uhhh that looks good  nice 
101,lol great
108,I haven t broadcasted yet ho
110, tho
111,we should aim for a smaller total mass  it s a little close to  40 
117,ta said we re good
118,what range of factorofsafety  s are you getting ?  mine are in the hundreds so it s not the limiting system
119,Our quality is back down to good  What changed ? 
121,I dont think we were supposed to finish that quick
122,Our quality is back down to good  What changed ? 
123,Our quality is back down to good  What changed ? 
124,im at  2   07 
126,My mass varies between  0 - 0   12  so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
128,sounds good
129,My mass varies between  0 - 0   12  so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
132,not me
133,mine is still at excellent so I don t know
136,what factorofsafety  s are you getting ? 
139,I just got my mass down to  0   11 
143,what factorofsafety  s are you getting ? 
144,whoever changed please go back
147,what variables do you use ? 
148,mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   59 
149,nevermind  back at excellent now 
150,nevermind  back at excellent now 
151,nevermind  back at excellent now 
152,I am getting around  2   26 - 2   95 
155,thats if pistonborediameter  equals to   45  where pistonborediameter is the piston bore diameter
156,the  2   95  design also has the lowest mass
157,Make sure you dont drop too much mass though
158,If that reduces your factorofsafety
162,Piston diameter and thickness
163,is that best case or worst case ?  my numbers are in the hundreds so we can play with flywheeldiameter if you use that
166,do we just sit here now ? 
167,alright
168,do we just sit here now ? 
172,not for me  on mine it says fair
174,yeah it does but all of the factorofsafety have been over  2  except one of them
176,I dont use flywheeldiameter I think
179,k
181,quality just went down to poor for me  seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything ? 
182,it looks like someone changed the mass to be wrong but yea
186,interstingly pisto-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low
187,Does the flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  affect any variables in your control ? 
189,Does the flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  affect any variables in your control ? 
190,Does the flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  affect any variables in your control ? 
192,Have you messaged the others about this yet ? 
193,Yeah I noticed the same thing
196,do you think I should try and increase those ? 
198,interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low
200,interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low
202,No  I do not believe so
205,what s your mass and factorofsafety
206,I can get mine up to  3   44  max where pistonborediameter  equals to   40 
207,how can you maximize factorofsafety and we can work around that maybe ? 
209,It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn t have to blindly flail about  not knowing who has been told what yet
213,it keeps changing for me  but none of the Key Design variables change
214,yeah exactly
216,broadcast that
217,idk they haven t been super responsive
218,Done
220,we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there
222,No  I believe my variables are independent of shaft diameter
223,No only the inner piston bore diameter
226,currently at mass  47   81   factorofsafety  2   32 
227,Alright  thank you 
229,Alright  thank you 
230,Alright  thank you 
232,also you can only see a few of the design variables  so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn t as good
237,our mass seems to be going up  are you using the original values ? 
238,our mass seems to be going up  are you using the original values ? 
239,leave yours as is for now  piston is biggest factor rn
240,leave yours as is for now  piston is biggest factor rn
243,I haven t changed a thing
245,Are you having troubles with factorofsafety ? 
246,aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click  check for broadcast 
247,from when it was at excellent
248,I think were at safe right now
249,me either
250,wonderful system  this is 
251,your individual mass ? 
254,we went from excellent to poor  rip
255,We need to trim mass
256,how much weight can you reduce roughly
257,The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass
259,I think its the piston changing but not sure
261,I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality
264,My weight varies between  0   0  and  0   12  so im the wrong person to reduce weight
267,yeah  leave yours in a safe config
268,If I drop my weight way down though my factorofsafety is super trash
269,My individual mass is  1   27 
270,have you been changing anything from when it was at excellent ? 
275,keep it up and we ll trim from there
278,mine is  6   33  I can try and lower it back to  6   26 
280,No  my factorofsafety values are all greater than  300  
281,no
287,how much weight can you trim  generally 
289,how much weigh tcan you trim generally ? 
293,looking at that now
294,I am at about  0   11 
296,I can try and trim a little more tho 
298,piston pin affects factorofsafety most but can t trim much weight
301,me either
302,What mass are you at ? 
305,We need to figure out who has the highest mass and factorofsafety
306, 0   11 
311,yeah
314,might be piston
315,Hello  is your factorofsafety above  1   5  ? 
316,earlier we had pretty good results with a bore diameter of  75 mm  should we give that a try again ? 
319,Crankshaft is at  1   49  for mass
321,What variables do you have listed under Key Design Variables ?  I have  pistonborediameter   bearingoffset   flywheelthickness  and  flywheeldiameter 
324,Not yet
332,what s your factorofsafety ? 
334,what s your factorofsafety ? 
337,mine is  2   47 
345, 2   5 
348,Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 
354,global is at  2   47   individual is  15886   04 
356,did you already push your broadcast ? 
358,because mine still read as excellent when my diameter was at  80 
361,global just changed to  1   17 
363, 80   150   12   60 
365,shows it as broadcasting for me
369,I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at  0   10  and factorofsafety is  2   77 
372,can you change it just to see
374,those are the same for me  Can you see any other variables ?  I can only see those  4 
375,yep  just give me a sec
378,sweet
380,I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 
381,I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 
383,That s ok  I control the conrod length to crank length ratio  r 1   does that affect you in any way ? 
386,cool
389,alright 
390,Nice 
392,no i only see those  4 
393,That should be good
396,thats the smallest weight and it gives part level factorofsafety of  4   55 
397,We need to have the heavy parts drop mass
400,What weight are you at ? 
401,no I do not think it does  I was able to get my factorofsafety up above  3   4  though
403,Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden 
405,Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden 
407,I mass about to drop the factorofsafety and mass because rod designer said it might help them
408,min with highest factorofsafety
409,make sure it s broadcasting propperyly  I ve had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all
413,actually mine is just as good with the diameter at  80   the factorofsafety is just a little lower at  2   3 
416,if i go all the way to min weight is cuts factorofsafety and only shaves   03 kg
418,whats your factorofsafety
421,whats yours
424,I think L 1  does affect me though
425,hmm ok
427,can you trim a tiny bit more ? 
429,definitely
430, 2   47 
432,Same for me my factorofsafety drops waaaay down and shaves only  0   12  from mass
433,idk how but our mass earlier was  33   29  or something
434,are you limited by pistonborediameter to determine L ?  we may be able to increase pistonborediameter and reduc eL for a weigh tsavings 
435,most of the mass is in the crank  I think you and the crank have some dependency on one another
436,with a factorofsafety of  2   31 
438,we are back to very good now too
440,yep
443,Yeah  that was nice
444,crank is  30  lbs alone
446,back to very good
447,global is at  2   3  right now
449,i only depend on the piston
450,we may reduce pistonborediameter just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass
452,ya  should chat about that
454,sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter  connecting rod thickness  and connecting rod length ratio
455,chat with piston pin to determine that
456,pistonborediameter is min at  40  I think
457,I do not control that  All I can do is the ratio of L : r  and it s not called L 1 
458,alright  guess not then
461,the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter
463,alright  guess no then
464,before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
467,before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
468,before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
469,but you can t change that right ? 
474,yeah
479,I haven t changed a thing since we were at excellent
480,Yeah i have the connecting rod at minimum thickness
482,sounds good but do you have any more room to reduce mass ?  I mass about the smallest I can make my parts
484,same
488,And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum
489,good idea
491,I mass the low factorofsafety of  2   01   can you cut any more mass out
494,just did    03 kg
497,sweet
498,Yeah  that s not on me 
500,thank you 
501,Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too
503,Same  Minimizing the piston bore would help me push stuff further down 
504,I hit up the piston but they never got back to me
505,what mass do you have for the flywheel ? 
508,don t change the broadcast  but if you simulate a minim weight situation  what s the savings ? 
509,what mass are you getting for the piston-pin
510,  52   it s minimized
512,completely
516,Im at  0   1  rn with a factorofsafety of  2   52 
518,still factorofsafety of over  1000 
519,based on the little chart they gave us our design should be at excellent
521,Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 
525,Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 
526,my weight is minimized completely factorofsafety  equals to   1212 
527,my mass is minimized
528,at  0   1 
529,Lmao thats massive
530,the program won t let me go any lower
532,same here  it would reduce my masses a bit
533,does changing bearingoffset save any mass ? 
536,Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow
537,I can reduce my mass by   03  and that reduces factorofsafety by   25  to  1   76 
538,I just saved mass changing flywheelthickness to  30 
539,Because everyone else is min mass
540,true 
541,yeah  working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass
542,Havent heard back from piston though
543,dont do that
544,can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is  75  ? 
545,If you increase the piston bore diameter  pistonborediameter  it increases my factorofsafety
546,we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? 
547,yeah that is what i am thinking as well
548,we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? 
549,we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? 
550,we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? 
551,yep
552,wait what
553,not me
554,I can probably drop down by another  0   01  or  0   02  if necessary
555,flywheelthickness increases mass 
556,I ve been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing pistonborediameter  but I haven t gotten any response 
557,pistons mass is  0   52  with a factorofsafety of  2   01 
558,Ok
559,though i guess it s more efficient mass than the shaft
561,lets try that
562,I can ask but I mass worried not everyone s was updated
563,I still see the total mass of  2   84 
564,mine are actually better than when it was excellent
565,I see  2   73 
568,yeah nope
569,well  update your broadcast
570,lmk when you do
571,Mine are  but i have not made any drastic changes since  Your lowering of flywheeldiameter helped me shave off  2  more lbs
572,Alright  I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design  so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens
574,i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? 
575,Ok
576,i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? 
577,i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? 
578,someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 
580,someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 
581,someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 
583,we can optimize bearingoffset and flywheelthickness looks like
584,Can we try to increase factorofsafety beyond  2   01  ? 
585,Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast 
586,Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast 
587,awesome  have you noticed that based on the chart we should be in excellent with our current values ? 
588,What about flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  ?  I noticed a change in  flywheelthickness  that I didn t broadcast
590,as long as your factorofsafety  greater than   2  it doesnt matter
591,yeah check again  thats me  funny relations with crankshaft
592,it s corrected
593,yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel
595,I let them know
596,I think that doing that effects the other designs as well
597,factorofsafety is just whoever has the lowest value
598,I let the mknow
599,yeah  I see the change now
600,oh right
601,I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong
602,ok awesome
603,ahh  its changed for me
604,what values are you suggesting ? 
605,did you change your broadcasted value ? 
606,Actually we re only at  2   84 
607,no
608,my factorofsafety is still  700  so we can trim something on my end
609,No  that does not affect it either
610,it s corrected now
611,yeah they won t respond to my chats either
612,like a higher bearingoffset
614,also i forgot factorofsafety is just the minimum value not an average
615,Ok  just making sure  thanks
616,If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our factorofsafety
617,sure give me a second
618,mine s still showing  80 
619,have you talked to the crankshaft ? 
620,yeah
621,idk if it helps mass though  does it ? 
622,oh alright
623,I double checked the handout and yeah  it s only dependent on lower factorofsafety
624,Who s in control of bore diameter ? 
625,something changed
626,mass went up quite a bit on my end
627,How much does our weight go up if you increase pistonborediameter ? 
628,Or rather  what affects it
629,did you change your value ? 
630,What s the best you can do with a flywheel shaft diameter of  45  ? 
632,even with max bearingoffset i still have factorofsafety  equals to   300 
633,i havent changed anything
634,k  maybe not then
635,working with them now
636,i haven t either
637,piston
638,Not for a little bit  did something change for you ? 
639,yeah change it back
641,yeah
642,its the current broadcast 
643,Also lol looking back at my simulations  minimizing pistonborediameter actually increases my mass
644,Looks like our factorofsafety went up
646,what changed ? 
647,factorofsafety went up to  2   22  and mass went up to  37   56  from  35   something
649,I just increased it by  2  mm and we are still slightly below our mass requirement
651,Go fast theyre giving out the money
652,Go fast theyre giving out the money
654,Bore diameter increased
655,Go fast theyre giving out the money
656,And a thickness of  12  ? 
657,that wasn t me  I am trying to shave off that little bit
658,We re still seeing  80  as the globally broadcast value  Weird 
659,i mass going to reduce flywheelthickness and see if we can minimize both
660,i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get
661, of mass
662,Nice 
663,generally our factorofsafety is fine  we need to decrease mass
664,i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get
665,Our factorofsafety went up
666,hahahahaa
670,i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get
671,Whats the best you can get with a bore diameter of  80  ? 
672,You re right 
673,I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the factorofsafety
674,Ok  We need to try to decrease mass
675,It s been good working with Yall
676,It s been good working with Yall
677,It s been good working with Yall
678,It s been good working with Yall
681,same here  any small decrease in mass lowers factorofsafety by a lot for me
682,don t put it at whatever it was at for when it read excellent
683,Let me decrease my thickness a bit
684,okay
685,stop changing
686,i mass not
687,stop changing
688,yee it has been good working with you as well
691,i haven t changed anything
692,we are in excellent 
693,we are in excellent 
694,we are in excellent 
695,we are at excellent again
696,we are in excellent 
697,I still see  40 
699,yep
700,don t change
703,They said they pistonborediameter broadcast it  but yeah  still  80   IDK what s going on 
704,ggs
705,ggs
706,ggs
707,ggs
708,you change let me lose  5  lbs  Thanks fellow engineer 
709,yesss just the handfull of cash
710,good working with ya
711,good working with ya
712,Sorry for the abrupt message
714,nope you re good
715,flywheel changed a value and i lost  5  lbs 
716,we re at excellent
717,we re at excellent
718,Oh wait we hit excellent
720,wow 
721,awesome job
722,It says currently broadcasting  42  on my end
723, 
726,Good working with you too
727,Ok  I decreased my weight a little bit
728, Your change  I got typing too fast
730,That s odd  I see  40   but I will change it to  42 
731,gg
732,Thanks  good job 
733,gg
734,gg
736,thanks  you too 
737,bearingoffset equals to  60   dc equals to  15 
738,TA is saying time is up
740,Good job 
741,Time is up i believe
742,dc is the weight variable for me
744,thanks   :  
745,time is up i believe
746,you too 
748,We ve got a  Good  engine
749,time is up i believe
750,good job 
751,good job 
752,We ve got a  Good  engine
754,Wanna call it ? 
755,okay we got excellent  we should be done here
756,nice work
757,Wanna call it ? 
758,nice work 
760,you too 
761,nice work 
762,I already got paid haha  although they said if you keep improving it we can get more even afterwars
763, afterwards
764,not yet
765,I think we can keep going
766,Yep just got paid
767,we should probably stop adjusting our values  we got excellent now and its going to be hard to make it any better
768,hello ? 
769,hey  whats the size of the piston bore ? 
770,hey
771,Currently the size is  40

792,working on it
793,Hey  I am going to need the piston bore diameter  Do you have any possible numbers ? 
794,hey
795,I was going to start out with  70   Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter ? 
796,mine are piston diameter and head thickness
797,will let you know in few minutes
798,Sounds good
799, 30  at the moment  but haven t run many yet
800,Hello  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0 
801,Do you have an idea of what value you re going to begin with for your bore diameter ? 
802,They are t _ I and r _  1  
803,What is your current bearing offset ? 
804,What are yours ? 
805,I need to find the optimum value for that  Assume it to be  25  for now
806,What is the bearing support offset you are using ? 
807,I mass starting with  40 
808,does your design require any spesific value for piston diameter
809,what is your mass when you maximize your flywheel diameter and thickness
810,Also  do you have an idea for the thickness value ?  Or an assumed value I should begin with ? 
811,I mass not sure any of your variables affect the piston pin ? 
812,will let you know in few minutes
813,For connecting rod design  I need to know your piston bore diameter
814, 130 
815,mm
816,I am going to try  160   The larger the offset the larger the mass and smaller factorofsafety
817,What piston diameter are you using that works well ? 
818,what is your mass and factorofsafety when you maximize both your design variables
819,diameter is  90 
820,mine are piston diameter and head thickness
821,piston  Me what is your mass and factorofsafety when you maximize both your design variables
822,diamater is  90 
823, 3   21 
824,Do you want a lagre mass ? 
825,Don t know if this matters to you  but the connecting rod I section is  2  mm and the ratio of length between the connecting rod and crank length is  3 
826,whats the corresponding factorofsafety ? 
827,Ok  I don t think so either  but sent just in case
828,Do you need anything from me ? 
829,you have one that works well for you ? 
830,Hello  what is the piston bore diameter ? 
831,it requires piston bore diameter  any range from  75  to  105 
832, 75  mm
833,so If i maximize both my design variables
834,all good
835,thanks
836,Thanks
837,i used  40 mm
838, 75  mm
839,Hello
840,Nope  let me know if you need anything
841,Need anything from me ? 
842, 75  mm is the bore diameter
843,Thanks  If you need them  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0 
844,I mass pretty sure I will leave the thickness at  10  mm
845,ok Ill try that
846,When I use maximum values  the mass is  36   38  and f is  22   95  
847,Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft
848,Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you ?  do you know ? 
849,Nope
850,Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you ?  do you know ? 
851,Do you have a value for the bore diameter ? 
852,Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you ?  do you know ? 
853,Hello  what is the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter ? 
854,Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the piston-pin
855,That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control
856,Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod
857,I assume the  30  was for the thickness right ? 
858,No  you ? 
859, 22   4  and  1   5 
860,check for broadcast
861,Large   3852   93 
862,correct
863,and also maximizing all the other variables I need
864,It does not affect my simulation 
865,ill check
866,cool
867,I have not decided on them yet 
868,Smaller works better for my factorofsafety and Mass
869,and my variables are thickness of connecting rod and ratio of length of connecting rod and crank length
870,was given wrong packet to start
871,Thanks
872,Are these affecting your results ? 
873,I mass getting a factorofsafety over  4000  with a thickness of  12   so I think  12   the minumum  is fine
874,Increasing the diameter will increase both factor of safety as well as the mass
875,A higher diameter increases the factorofsafety but also increases the mass  with pistonborediameter equals to  40  im at a mass of  0   1  and factorofsafety  2   77 
876,Ok  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0  
877,so don t think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
878,I mass trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the factorofsafety while minimizing its mass
879,Ok thanks
880,so all the values you get are assuming max piston bore diameter ? 
881,Hi  I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me
882,Those do not effect me  I may have a slight say in crank length 
883,Don t think so
884,is it ok to change the diameter value  there is a better alternative
885,is it ok to change the diameter value  there is a better alternative
886,Let me know if you change the bearing offset
887,what are the other variables you need ? 
888,is it ok to change the diameter value  there is a better alternative
889,Hey  I just wanted to ask if you needed anything from me
890, 85  is the updated
891,flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and pistonborediameter
892,Hey  I mass good for now  thanks  let me know if you need anything from me
893,Hello  what variables do you have control over ? 
894,I think I can work with that
895,Alright  Do you have a value for the flywheel diameter ? 
896,let me know if you change it at all
897,Hey  let me know if you need anything from me
898,Piston bore diamteter
899,Hello  what variables do you have control over ? 
900,I do not
901,Hello  what variables do you have control over ? 
902,for sure  go for it
903,Hello  what variables do you have control over ? 
904,you need values from me ? 
905,what piston bore diameter are you using ? 
906,piston head thickness and piston bore diameter
907,Yea i believe so  what is it ? 
908,Flywheel shaft diameter
909, 40 
910,Thanks for checking in but I am all set in terms of needed values  Is there anything on my end I should send over ? 
911,and Thickness of the flywheel
912,Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel Shaft Diameter
913,are all the values you get assuming you maximize the variables out of your control ? 
914,I used  40  mm which is the minimum value I can use
915,I should be good for now
916,I don t think so  all I need is piston bore diameter
917,going with the minimum to reduce mass because my factorofsafety is so high
918,Thanks  I mass good on my end  Is there anything you need from my end ? 
919,tell me if it s better for you if I use greater value
920,unless you change that at all ? 
921,Yes  that is when I used piston bore diameter of  105 
922,yes
923,I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod lenth and the crank lenth
924,How about you ? 
925,No  I do not need anything
926,I don t think you need anything from me  do you ? 
927,try flyweel thickness as  12   0  and shaft diameter as  60   0 
928,Have you changed the diameter at all ? 
929,Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we re at  if you haven t done so already 
930,Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we re at  if you haven t done so already 
931,Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we re at  if you haven t done so already 
932,Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we re at  if you haven t done so already 
933,ok conrod s variables also depends on piston bore diameter
934,sure
935,i do not
936,i think you might have to increase it
937,hello  what variable do you have control over ?  and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others ? 
938,i ll set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
939,Does a large Flywheel mass help you ? 
940,hello  what variable do you have control over ?  and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others ? 
941,tell me if it s better to use greater value because  40 mm is the minimum value
942,hello  what variable do you have control over ?  and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others ? 
943,No at most ill change it by  10   how much would a diameter of  50  affect your mass and factorofsafety
944,crankshaft s variables also depends on piston bore diameter
945,Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do 
946,Okay
947,Thanks
948,ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
949,Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do 
950,I currently have it as small as possible because that seems beneficial 
951,ok sounds good
952,what value did you decide on ?  nothing updated on my screen
953,Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do 
954,i have the crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
955,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
956,nah chat with piston deisgner
957,check for broadcast
958,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
959,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
960,pistonborediameter  equals to   75 
961,I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
962,crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
963,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
964,we are using  75  mm rn
965,Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do 
966,using  85  and  15 
967,and I have no variables controlled by others
968,using  85  and  15 
969,I dont have any other dependent variables
970,ok cool
971, 2   31 
972, 2   04 
973,pistonborediameter  equals to  75 
974,Actually our mass is already way over  I ll probably keep it the same
975,piston bore diameter affects both crankshaft and conrods  variables
976,yeah  what is it ? 
977,so im going to max piston bore diamter and well iterate from there
978,I have my best values broadcast with   12 kg and factorofsafety equals to  3   44 
979,By how much would be good for you ? 
980,I control Flywheel thickness and Flywheel shaft diameter  I need Crankshaft Bearing Offset
981,pistonborediameter  equals to   75 
982,Where exactly do i check that ? 
983,It s up
984,Projected outputs
985,got  0   1 kg and factorofsafety  equals to   2   77 
986,when pistonborediameter is max
987,it is best for me
988,Nice 
989, 11   11 
990,what about you ? 
991,what values do you have control over ? 
992,What did you choose your diameter to be ? 
993,what is yours ? 
994,basically bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to  15 
995,We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer 
996,We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer 
997,bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15 
998,Are you still at  160  for support offset ? 
999,Haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy  It seems we ve all broadcast our stuff
1000,those are my values
1001,pistonborediameter is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
1002,I set t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4   and the quality turns out to be excellent
1003,so flywheeldiameter doesn t make a difference for my factorofsafety
1004,Im gonna do  150  instead
1005,Make sure to broad cast variables
1006,Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 
1007,I believe factorofsafety of  2   31 
1008,Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 
1009,make sure to broadcast variables
1010,Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 
1011,I chose  40 mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it s good for him or her if I use maximum value
1012,Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 
1013,make sure to broadcast variables
1014,Oh wait nevermind  I don t think we have a piston pin engineer though 
1015,Oh wait nevermind  I don t think we have a piston pin engineer though 
1016, 4000 
1017,However  I cannot do that because it s critical to the weight of piston
1018, 6   45  now
1019,I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length
1020,What is flywheeldiameter ? 
1021,So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers ? 
1022,Actually  2   83   read the wrong one
1023,my mass is pretty low already  But make sure to broadcast variables
1024,Would a larger bore work better for you ?  I could go to about  45  but beyond that  my factorofsafety goes below  1   7   My factorofsafety is currently at  3   44  with a bore of  40 
1025,input shaft wheel diameter
1026,I have a high factorofsafety for everywhere in my combination of ranges
1027,Am broadcasting  150  and  50 
1028,Oh yeah okay 
1029,Way to be on top of things  I won t vote you off the island
1030,what values work best for you
1031,lol
1032,I updated
1033,rightt
1034,yeah Im doing that after every sim  we re already in the very good range
1035,bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to   15 
1036,I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually  So we cannot optimize that part 
1037,I used  70 mm  Try to update yours
1038,mine shows poor
1039,Hey  just want to make sure that the bearing offset is still  70  mm
1040,piston have control over diameter as well  I need the diameter for my variables
1041,I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety
1042,I don t know how that affects me  but my simulation shows excellent  I think someone isn t broadcasting the right values
1043,Any idea if the piston diameter should change ? 
1044,Do I have any variables that affect your result ? 
1045,I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety
1046,mine shows poor range  Is this same for you ? 
1047,yeah  the diameter
1048,I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety
1049,Piston pin designer said it is in very good range
1050,some one got good quality what where your variables in that
1051,Do I have any variables that affect your result ? 
1052,some one got good quality what where your variables in that
1053,some one got good quality what where your variables in that
1054,some one got good quality what where your variables in that
1055,wait someone changed something and it went way down
1056,I mass trying to test new values  I mass currently trying it with  80 
1057,Whats your mass and factorofsafety ? 
1058,they were the minimum of both
1059,Okay update your pistonborediameter but try to keep it relatively low if possible
1060,Is it good to be maximized or minimized ? 
1061,Whats your mass and factorofsafety ? 
1062,my factorofsafety is best at  40   making it larger decreases my factorofsafety
1063,ok i dont have those values in my test bed
1064,Let me know what you decide
1065,Yeah  I was looking at the factor of safety and realized that with the head so small  the factorofsafety wasn t gonna go up
1066, 4  for head thickness and  75  for piston diameter
1067,yeah
1068,If I hold my variables same  the lower the diameter  the lower the Ms and factorofsafety
1069,My simulation would be excellent  the broadcast was very good and now poor ? 
1070,So  is it good for you to be minimized ? 
1071,ok keep those for now
1072,does a larger bore increase your factorofsafety ? 
1073,my factor of safety is maximized at low bearingoffset values
1074,my variables are t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4  
1075,yes
1076,yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor
1077,yes pistonpin said same thing
1078,i ll rebroadcast with those values
1079,i havnt changed anything
1080,what is your fs ? 
1081,mass is  0   54  and factorofsafety is  3286 
1082,yes do that
1083,I havnt changed anything
1084,I had an excellent quality  but with someone s new broadcast  it s not poor
1085,what are your current thickness and diameter ? 
1086,now 
1087,what is your current factorofsafety ? 
1088,with pistonborediameter equals to  53   i got mass equals to  0   13 kg and factorofsafety  equals to   3   18 
1089,My flywheel is as small as possible  flywheelthickness  equals to   12  flywheeldiameter  equals to   40   factorofsafety is still in the thousands 
1090,Yea  but also the weight
1091,Hello
1092,Thanks  I ll run some simulations with those numbers
1093,Do you know where our low factorofsafety is coming from ? 
1094,yo  what is your factorofsafety ? 
1095,what is your factorofsafety ? 
1096,No idea
1097,mine is  2   44 
1098,We were at excellent and now poor  did you change anything ? 
1099,mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now
1100,our factor of safety went down
1101,mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now
1102,piston is about to update me with pistonborediameter  I need it to be low too  How about you
1103,Is the mass significantly increased ? 
1104,mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now
1105,mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now
1106, ? 
1107,where they maximum minimum of both variables ? 
1108,Is there any way you can decrease the mass ? 
1109,We were at exceelent and now poor  did you change anything ? 
1110,Didn t change anything  We need to decrease mass
1111,ms is just below  2   factorofsafety is around  20 
1112,do you have an input i should try ? 
1113,We once had an excellent quality though
1114,or avg
1115,only need a factorofsafety of  2 
1116,okay  I will see what i can do with  53 
1117,Our factorofsafety was at like  2   5  and mass was at  44   Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton 
1118,What values do you need ? 
1119, Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
1120,someone is messing this up  are values are getting very bad
1121,crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter  so I used  70 mm
1122, Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
1123,i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier
1124, Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
1125, Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
1126,yeah thats ok the factorofsafety for othee s will be less
1127,alright I will try and reduce the mass
1128,i just rebroadcasted
1129,ok I have mass :   3   05   factorofsafety  2   02 
1130, 3286  right now
1131,Yeah everything is going down now  Not sure why  I haven t chantged anything for like  10  mins 
1132,the thickness t _ I  ranges from  5  to  15  mm  and ratio r 1   ranges from  5  to  5 
1133,I feel like its the crankshaft guy  everyone else has high factorofsafety
1134,Every  10  pistonborediameter I decrease from  70   mass decrease like  0   2 - 0   3 
1135,thickness is  10  and diameter is  22 
1136,i just changed my variables back to their minimum
1137,I think you could decrease mass bc factorofsafety only needs to be above  2 
1138,Must be
1139,also broadcast those  I am not using your variables others might
1140,He wont respond lol
1141, 85  seems good for now  testing my own combinations
1142, 4 
1143,it was excelent  someone messed it up
1144,thats what they were at when we had excellent
1145,i tried  95 
1146,the minimum mass I have while the factorofsafety is above  2  is  5   45   I have made  14  simulations to justify the result 
1147,My values of  150  and  50  are getting me highest factorofsafety and lowest mass
1148,It doesn t matter for me
1149,I can increase the factorofsafety  but it almost isn t worth it with how much weight is added on
1150,ok ill see
1151,i have mass  1   27   factorofsafety :   15886 
1152,Cause the factorofsafety only goes up by like   5 
1153,Great
1154,I need a bore of at most  48 
1155,Yeah  mass is still high though
1156,otherwise my factorofsafety is below  1 
1157,is that a typo ? 
1158,piston told me  crankshaft want him to have miximum diameter
1159,also what are your flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness values
1160,no my mass is  3   05  and my factorofsafety is  2   02 
1161,i feel like we care about the lowest factorofsafety of all subsystems
1162,factorofsafety is good  Mass is  10 kg too high
1163, ?  ?  ? 
1164,no it is not
1165,The global variables are giving our current factorofsafety is  0   57  so I think we need to maximize that
1166,The factorofsafety is  2   03   so there are no improvements available
1167,so my guess is that if you re higher than  2  you re good
1168,how ?  are you broadcasting it ? 
1169,My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 
1170,my best values currently are flywheelthickness  equals to   10  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25 
1171,flywheel factorofsafety are all very high
1172,wow ok
1173,My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 
1174,what are your values currently at ? 
1175,someones factorofsafety is too low
1176,what are your values currently at ? 
1177,That s pretty minimal
1178,flywheel says they have an factorofsafety of  3286  apparently ? 
1179,what are your values currently at ? 
1180,now we are at very good
1181,Ok
1182,now VERY GOOd  we should sit here
1183,now we are at very good
1184,factorofsafety decrease like  2 - 3 
1185,yeah  told him to reduce it to save some weight
1186, To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me
1187, To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me
1188, To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me
1189, To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me
1190,you mean the global variables ?  the factorofsafety is  0   57  right now
1191,ok how much can you decrease mass before below  2  ? 
1192,what is your factorofsafety ? 
1193,I haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy
1194,Works for me
1195, 2   83 
1196,ok don t change anything
1197,no we should go for excellent
1198,Will experiment
1199,we already had it once
1200,howeffect on mass
1201,ok don t change anything
1202,ok don t change anything
1203,ok don t change anything
1204,Was  12  and  40  still your used numbers ? 
1205,We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol 
1206,for your ouputs only ? 
1207,We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol 
1208,agreed  we can still try to look for improvements
1209,We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol 
1210,How s the effect of the diameter on mass ? 
1211,Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 
1212,or global ? 
1213,Is  75  still the number youre going with
1214, To all  :  ok with results
1215,How big of a difference between  45  and  48  is there for your factorofsafety
1216, To all  :  ok with results
1217, To all  :  ok with results
1218,yes
1219, To all  :  ok with results
1220,very big
1221,who got very good and broadcast those values
1222,yeah we are now at very good
1223,increases
1224,My outputs  Global is  34   35  and  0   81 
1225,What could i do to help your factorofsafety go up ? 
1226,who got very good and broadcast those values
1227,I mass not sure why they aren t updating though when I change my input values
1228,also decreases my factorofsafety
1229,who got very good and broadcast those values
1230,do you need it to be higher or lower ? 
1231, 45  equals to  1   7    48  equals to  1   15 
1232,Ok lets make small changes but remember which broadcast you were at incase
1233,who got very good and broadcast those values
1234,based on the handout we should be at  excellent  idk why it doesn t say that
1235,what about the factorofsafety ? 
1236,No i think its fine i was just curious
1237,crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs 
1238,does yours show exccelent ? 
1239,crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs 
1240,Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 
1241,values are at a minimum for me
1242,crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs 
1243,yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
1244,yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
1245,I mass not sure why they aren t updating though when I change my input values
1246,yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
1247,yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
1248,i havnt changed anything  my variables seem to be the best so far
1249,try to decrease you mass while keeping a factorofsafety above  2 
1250,that is for everyone  are you broadcasting your variables so that they are accounted for in the total global factorofsafety ? 
1251,you need to change your current broadcast
1252,our mass is too high rn
1253,  ? 
1254,I thought that the factorofsafety on top is our total global factorofsafety
1255,  ? 
1256,Recheck your broadcast  it just went to poor
1257,It went down again
1258,  ? 
1259,If I increase the Piston Diameter  how much will it affect your factorofsafety
1260,it was just at very good  someone changed and it went up a lot
1261,recheck it
1262,yes
1263,the mass shot up
1264,Yea I just asked him
1265,It went down again
1266,It went down again
1267,it just went back to  poor 
1268,I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length
1269,ok with the results
1270,what s your mass and factorofsafety when diameter of  70 mm is used ? 
1271,try to get the mass down below  40 
1272,do you need anything from me ? 
1273,man  0   09  factorofsafety lol
1274,although the new broadcast increased the mass
1275,Lets decrease mass
1276,I think he ll need my Diameter to increarse  but if i do that then piston-pin factorofsafety goes below  1 
1277,lets decrease mass
1278,I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length
1279,what are your values now ? 
1280,yeah I haven t changed anything
1281,you need to broadcast your simulation results  after simulating  you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results
1282,do you need anything from me ? 
1283,is your factorofsafety  0   09  now ? 
1284,increasing diameter decreases factorofsafety ? 
1285,Same
1286,anyone know why it went back to poor ? 
1287,anyone know why it went back to poor ? 
1288,your specific results will be in the table under the charts
1289, To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back
1290,I think someone s trying to get excellent
1291,did you get very good simulation ? 
1292,Nevermind  global changed to  55   36  and  2   03 
1293, To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back
1294,I mass not entirely sure  No matter what inputs I have  my mass and factorofsafety aren t changing and it ; s a bit confusing
1295, To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back
1296, To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back
1297,idk
1298,what can we do to increase your factorofsafety ? 
1299,what is yours ? 
1300,yes
1301,did you get very good simulation ? 
1302,did you get very good simulation ? 
1303,haven t changed anything on my end  that s weird
1304,Is anybody out there ? 
1305,Ok  I mass talking to the crankshaft guy to figure out how it affects his factorofsafety because he is the one with the lowest factorofsafety right now
1306,try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin factorofsafety remains above  2 
1307,i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
1308,Yeah for a bit 
1309,Mass :   1   75  factorofsafety :  6   07 
1310,that s not good  why did you tell me to increase the diameter ? 
1311,I havent updated anything
1312,Same
1313,I mass getting poor right now
1314,Ok  try reducing the diameter to  45  and see what happens
1315,Keep  70  mm I mass trying to get out of the poor region
1316,Will keep you updated
1317, 1   2 
1318,Just pistonborediameter
1319,But I haven t changed anything and it went down 
1320,You ? 
1321,I havent updated anything  so it was either crankshaft or connecting rod
1322,Can you try and minimize your bearing offset ?  I mass getting the best results for a bearing offset of  60 
1323,but mine is flywheel  wont get any lower
1324,yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good  ? 
1325,Gotcha
1326,I do not believe so
1327,wait
1328,haven t changed anything on my ene
1329,yeah  0   09  isnt hot
1330,end 
1331,are you broadcasting new values ? 
1332,Gotcha
1333,I just need pistonborediameter which I mass working on with you and piston
1334,I tried decreasing my mass
1335,increasing pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety
1336,sorry
1337,You ? 
1338,are you broadcasting new values ? 
1339,yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good
1340,factorofsafety ? 
1341,Yes  I just figured out how to use the software  Let me check it out
1342,Did you make that change ? 
1343,Yea  just a slight chance to fail
1344,yeah
1345,are you broadcasting new values ? 
1346,let me know what the new diameter is
1347,New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated
1348,no
1349,but the weight incresases too
1350,New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated
1351,is  150   0  the best value ? 
1352,the new one is  45  as of now
1353,i tried decreasing my mass
1354,Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
1355,ok
1356,New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated
1357,yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good
1358,Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
1359,how much does that effect your numbers
1360,I can t decrease mass anymore without going below a factorofsafety of  2 
1361,Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
1362,It showed very good and I haven t changed anything since then 
1363,sorry  I just need pistonborediameter as well
1364,Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
1365,what s your factorofsafety right now with  70 mm diameter ? 
1366,im pretty sure a factor of safety less than  1  is a guaranteed fail
1367,I can t change it from here because it will lower mass  but it will also reduce factor of safety
1368,yea
1369,Working with you and piston as well
1370,ok run again with values when you were getting good
1371,and your mass ? 
1372,ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more
1373,also i changed the diameter to  45 
1374,ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more
1375,Did you make any change after it was at very good ? 
1376,Is there a flywheelthickness that works best for you ? 
1377,ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more
1378,ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more
1379,sweet  ill update my factorofsafety
1380,No  My values have been the same since about  9  :  45  
1381,Did you make any change after it was at very good ? 
1382,Do you still have your diameter at maximum ? 
1383,factorofsafety went from  3   18  to  2   95  and mass from  0   13  to  0   11 
1384,so its fine
1385,I did not
1386,yes
1387,Supposedly increasing the offset increases mass and decreases f  so lose-lose for me
1388,try using  50  mm
1389,for bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  flywheelthickness equals to   30  pistonborediameter  equals to   70  factorofsafety  equals to   2   37 
1390,what is your mass
1391,i still have my two best broadcasted
1392,mine is as low as possible too  We cant all have minimum mass
1393,do you need my rod cross section to increase ? 
1394,try using  50  mm
1395,Cool  and that brings the piston-pin factorofsafety to just under  2 
1396,what is the lowest mass you got while keeping factorofsafety above  2  ? 
1397,no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating
1398,flywheelthickness just changes the mass for me
1399, 27   44 
1400,we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
1401,yes so run it with those values a
1402,we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
1403,he won t respond to me
1404,we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
1405,we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted
1406,and broadcast the design
1407,My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass
1408,My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass
1409,higher flywheelthickness is better for me
1410,My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass
1411,My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass
1412,Anything changing when you change your numbers now ? 
1413,try to decrease mass while keeping factorofsafety over  2 
1414,can you try using  50  mm ?  and try to maximize the factorofsafety ? 
1415,Has the crankshaft got back to you about his factorofsafety ? 
1416,Nope
1417,The only person that hasn t responded regarding the change is rod designer
1418,or over  1   5  at the minimum
1419,The only person that hasn t responded regarding the change is rod designer
1420,or she
1421,The only person that hasn t responded regarding the change is rod designer
1422, 27   44 
1423, 11   09 
1424,I just followed up with him
1425,or it
1426,yeah  :  
1427,make sure to broadcast
1428,poor of me to assume
1429,Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design 
1430,factorofsafety went up
1431,Anything you need from me yet
1432,i know  if this were Hell s Kitchen I pistonborediameter get gordon ramsay to yell at him lol
1433,Did you change your broadcast by anychance ? 
1434,Has the crankshaft got back to you about their factorofsafety ? 
1435,whats your mass at ? 
1436,whats your mass at ?  and can it be lowered
1437,Not yet
1438,wait can you explain again
1439,Sweet  by how much ? 
1440,and can it be lowered
1441,me either
1442,can you try broadcasting it since we are over  12  kg
1443,so you are in control of flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness ? 
1444,okay we have very good again
1445,Okay
1446,crankshaft has a mass of  28 
1447,whats your mass at ?  and can it be lowered
1448,I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts  I dont need them  factorofsafety  equals to   0   71  now
1449,flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness yes
1450,Hey  have you broadcasted your values ? 
1451,wait now we re very good
1452,our weight is too high
1453,We are good  he said his factorofsafety went up when I changed it down to  45 
1454,our weight is too high
1455,our weight is too high
1456,it s very good right now
1457, This crankshaft is so broke I can hear it asking me for money 
1458,Mass is at a min  factorofsafety is still about  4700 
1459,Great Work
1460,Great Work
1461,Great Work
1462,Great Work
1463,sweet 
1464,mass is  36   43 kg
1465,I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
1466,No one change anything
1467,im at  60 
1468,its conrod
1469,No one change anything
1470,no one change anything
1471,good
1472,let s not change it
1473,nice
1474,yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
1475,actually we should be getting excellent
1476,hello
1477,hello
1478,I am the flywheel  and would like to know about the  Crankshaft bearing offset  when you make a decision on it 
1479,hello
1480,hello
1481,what diameter should i use  i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of  97   5 
1482,hello
1483,What is your factorofsafety ? 
1484,hello
1485,depends
1486,Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter ? 
1487,Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter ? 
1488,Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter ? 
1489,Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter ? 
1490,Are you in charge of determining the piston bore diameter ? 
1491,i need to determine a piston diamter first because i think that is most important of my two variables
1492,I don t think so
1493,then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and factorofsafety
1494,Ok 
1495,what diameter are you using
1496,no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio
1497,yes
1498,no i do not
1499,Do you need either of those ? 
1500,im tryin g 90  mm
1501,Okay cool  maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need ? 
1502,what shaft diameter are you using
1503,Okay cool  maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need ? 
1504,im trying  90  mm
1505,No i do not 
1506,Okay cool  maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need ? 
1507,what diam are you using
1508,rn i have a  90  mm diameter
1509,Hello  I am currently trying to solve for the piston-pin length  and I need the piston bore diameter  pistonborediameter  Do you happen to have this value ? 
1510,My apologies  Plots were not showing up for me originally  I mass on it
1511,no worries
1512,What requirements do you have on the Piston bore diameter ? 
1513,If you make it bigger  mass goes up and factorofsafety as well ? 
1514,What is your primary goal in this simulation ? 
1515,What is your primary goal in this simulation ? 
1516,What is your primary goal in this simulation ? 
1517,Also  maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need ? 
1518,What is your primary goal in this simulation ? 
1519,what dimensions are you using
1520,currently  55  mm unless you think a better value could be used
1521,I have the piston bore diameter set to  47   5  currently
1522,I am doing that now  Thanks for the help 
1523,Deciding on dimensions of a piston-pin
1524,yes
1525,Im using   8  and   55  for r 2  and r 3 
1526,What bore diameter are you choosing ? 
1527,increase factorofsafety decrease mass of the connecting rod
1528,i mass focusing on minimizing thickness primarily
1529,thats the most central point in my simulation
1530,I have piston-pin length and piston pin diameter  so let me know if youd like me to change any of those values
1531,increasing it will increase the force on the connecting rod
1532,All my sims seem to have it at  40  rn
1533,Definitely 
1534,I have not decided yet  What would help you most ? 
1535,Tell me the tradeoffs
1536,Do you understand how it al fits together  I feel like we all only see that small snapshot of our component
1537,I am in charge of diameter and piston head thickness  Increasing diameter will increase the area  so more force  but also increase mass  Increasing head thickness will increase mass but also factorofsafety
1538,ok one sec
1539,can you try making it a bit bigger ? 
1540,nobody change anythibn
1541,I currently have pistonborediameter set at  40 
1542,dont change anyhting
1543,check for a broadcast maybe ? 
1544,So far  the  90 mm looked better than the  97   5 mm
1545,dont change anything
1546,dont change anyhting
1547,basically all i can do is increase mass of the connecting and therefore increase facotr of safety
1548,hmm
1549,I mass not sure how this works tbh haha
1550,we are at very good
1551,we are at very good
1552,we are at very good
1553,we are at very good
1554,is this scooter
1555,It just updated
1556,i see poor ? 
1557,So is there any tradeoff at all ? 
1558,it just said very good
1559,It looks like im better off with a smaller piston diamter if you can make that work
1560,So I mass trying to pick values of pistonborediameter and tH that will minimize mass and maximize factorofsafety  but I know pistonborediameter also interacts with Force
1561,someone changed a parameter
1562,Can you change pistonborediameter ? 
1563,So is there any tradeoff at all ? 
1564,tandy
1565,Where do you even see that ?  My global quality shows poor
1566,Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well 
1567,Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well 
1568,did you just increase your mass ? 
1569,Ok  it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i mass gonna make the piston smaller to change that
1570,Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well 
1571,yeah it does now
1572,Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well 
1573,elaborate  Are there any tradeoffs ? 
1574,did you just increase your mass ? 
1575,it said very good but someone changed someting
1576,more mass
1577,What varibales do you need to consider ? 
1578,What variables do you need to consider ? 
1579,i increased the diameter to improve the factor of safety  I can reduce it if we want to try it out
1580,I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used
1581,For sure 
1582,So you want to minimize mass  but increase factorofsafety ? 
1583,I agree  I also can change the Piston head thickness 
1584,Sounds good  I ll try to decrease shaft mass
1585,yep
1586,We need to decrease mass a lot
1587,mine is showing as poor right now
1588,We need to decrease mass a lot
1589,Yes  I want to minimize mass but also don t want the piston head to fail
1590,We need to decrease mass a lot
1591,We need to decrease mass a lot
1592,is your objectives different ? 
1593,Got it
1594,i saw a very good for a second but its gone now
1595,at this point  just piston diameter
1596,mainly because mass
1597,my part doesnt effect mass very much
1598,I haven t touched anything for a while
1599,ok 
1600,My part is at the lowest mass possible currently
1601,I don t think that affects my design at all but that might reduce some mass
1602,we need to work on making the design much lighter though if thats possible with your part
1603,Right now I am at  90   Would you want me to increase or decrease that ? 
1604,Minimize mass of connecting rod and maximize factor of safety against yielding due to buckling 
1605,how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? 
1606,I can also change tH
1607,how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? 
1608,changed piston back to  40  mm
1609,how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? 
1610,how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? 
1611,I reduced mine to the lowest value  and our factorofsafety is good now
1612,Me too
1613,I put mine to initial values and the factorofsafety is good now
1614,Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent 
1615,tH doesn t effect me  can you try decreasing pistonborediameter
1616,Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
1617,Lost a great deal on factorofsafety 
1618,Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent 
1619,factorofsafety is good just decrease mass
1620,okay
1621, 2   31  to  25   99 
1622,factorofsafety is good just decrease mass
1623,What factors are you interested in ? 
1624,that s okay  factorofsafety is still close to  2 
1625,factorofsafety is good just decrease mass
1626,If I increase flywheel the thickness  and diameter  the mass increases  but the factorofsafety decreases 
1627,I need to find two fitting ratios  r 2  and r 3   As these are increased  the both the mass and factorofsafety decrease
1628,I don t have control over any diameters
1629,factorofsafety is good just decrease mass
1630,my factorofsafety is the lowest at  2   03   so you can probably make it even smaller if possible
1631,What factors are you interested in ? 
1632,can you try decreasing your mass ? 
1633,rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 
1634,Is there anything related to an increase decrease in mass factorofsafety on your end ? 
1635,I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers 
1636,rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 
1637,I ve changed to the lowest mass acceptable for fs  greater than   2  for the piston
1638,I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers 
1639,gotcha  I put mine at the lowest value to check it and the factorofsafety is good now
1640,rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 
1641,bearingoffset and dc
1642,im trying to figure out who has the min factorofsafety
1643,I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers 
1644,mine is  2   09 
1645,my factorofsafety is also  2   09 
1646,thats a double negative then right  Can you see the power components  I know we have to satisfy minimums for some specs
1647,what variables are you considering ? 
1648,whats your factorofsafety ?  mine is  2   09   piston is  2   09  as well
1649,pistonborediameter  flywheeldiameter  and flywheelthickness
1650,whats your factorofsafety ?  mine is  2   09   piston is  2   09  as well
1651,gotcha  my factorofsafety stays realtivcly high with low mass so I shouldn t have too mcuh effect on overall weight
1652,it is the smallest it can be
1653,i have  2   7  factorofsafety and  57  mass
1654,It s the smae tradeoff for everyone
1655,we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass
1656, same
1657,Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent 
1658,we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass
1659, bearing support offset and crank pin diameter 
1660,we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass
1661,The only thing that affects my design is the bore diameter so we re all good  Are you affected by r 2  or r 3  ? 
1662,we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass
1663,mine is at  1   45  now
1664, bearing support offset and crank pin diameter 
1665, bearing support offset and crank pin diameter bearing support offset and crank pin diameter 
1666,frick my mass is  57 
1667,whats the lightest you can go with fs  greater than   2 
1668,It s the same tradeoff for everyone
1669,Is that value working for you or would it work better if pistonborediameter was larger
1670,let me check
1671,i am interested in the crankshaft bearing offset by another designer
1672,okay I don t need either of those in my analysis
1673,I have an factorofsafety of  1   45  now  I ll try increasing the diameter
1674,try that
1675,these are the variables I need to consider for design
1676,and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
1677,What variables do you need to consider ? 
1678,I have t 1   L  and r
1679,Makes sense  the connecting rod probably has more impact on factorofsafety than mass
1680,nah  I assume you re talking about the piston bore diameter right ? 
1681,That effects me as well
1682,yeah thats the totla
1683,It s the same tradeoff for everyone
1684,im talking about your indidivudal part
1685,Yeah the piston bore
1686,What would you like the pistonborediameter to be ? 
1687,can you try the one thats closes to  2  ? 
1688,Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds 
1689,I am considering the piston diameter and the piston head thickness
1690,the closest factorofsafety I have above  2  is  3   78   I ll try broadcasting it
1691,it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at  2   03   so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety  that would be ideal
1692,minimum mass that has factorofsafety  greater than   2 
1693,ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
1694,My factorofsafety is around  2   Some parts may just have different ranges
1695,I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs  greater than   2  design 
1696,My design includes r 2  and r 3   do those affect yours at all ? 
1697,My design includes r 2  and r 3   do those affect yours at all ? 
1698,lowest  
1699,Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds 
1700,Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds 
1701,Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds 
1702,Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds 
1703,yeah thats what i did
1704,and what ive been telling the others hahah
1705,no i don t think so
1706,I don t think so
1707,I just changed my factorofsafety to  3   78  but a higher mass  That s the closest I have to  2   09 
1708,ya I need the piston to change the bore diameter so I can see how if effects my numbers
1709,Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column  not the variables you control  Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output ? 
1710,Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column  not the variables you control  Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output ? 
1711,Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column  not the variables you control  Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output ? 
1712,Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column  not the variables you control  Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output ? 
1713,Since the lowest of my designs is like  140   I mass going to prioritize mass reduction
1714,got it
1715,Ye i think so  mine for just my part is  3   84 
1716,interesting
1717,Do all of us just ahve a control with a mass and factorofsafety ? 
1718, ? 
1719,and we are just trying to optimize somehow ? 
1720,message back when you did it
1721, ? 
1722,message back when you did it
1723,message back when you did it
1724,Yes  that s the goal
1725,Im on mine rn with  0   1 
1726,what values are you at
1727,message back when you did it
1728,my part mass is  6   5  and my factorofsafety is  2   09 
1729,The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers
1730,jk u did
1731,done
1732,for flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and stuff
1733,it doesnt have to be that high
1734,doing that now
1735,my factors of safety are around  0   5 - 3 
1736,I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter  do those affect yours ? 
1737,just barely above  2 
1738,I think smaller
1739,piston-pin is not responding
1740,masses in the hundreths
1741,piston-pin is not responding
1742,I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness  What are your design variables ? 
1743,piston-pin is not responding
1744, 12  for flywheelthickness and  60  for flywheeldiameter  my foss shows it at  12708   83  which makes no sense to me
1745,Do you know if theres a specific way all our parts work together ?  I can change mass and factorofsafety of my part but depending on like my offset do other parts need to be a certain dimension ? 
1746,I mass trying differetn combos  but its weird
1747,What are your design variables ? 
1748,That s literally the lowest value i have that s above  2  though
1749,whats your current factorofsafety ? 
1750,What are your design variables ? 
1751,Since the lowest of my designs is like  140   I mass going to prioritize mass reduction
1752,crankshaft offset
1753,Since the lowest of my designs is like  140   I mass going to prioritize mass reduction
1754,my foss is  12708   83  which makes no sense to me
1755,yes both do
1756,are your masses high
1757,What are your design variables ? 
1758,that cant be right
1759,and crank pin diameter
1760,I have lowest mass output selected currently
1761,exactly
1762,I decreased it to  82   5 
1763,I have lowest mass output selected currently
1764,Hey did you see message from flywheel ? 
1765,i don t think either of those affect me
1766,I have lowest mass output selected currently
1767,I have lowest mass output selected currently
1768,yes  that was what I was thinking
1769,yeah thats weird
1770,Its now at  82   5 
1771,whats the mass ? 
1772,I-section thickness and length of connecting rod 
1773,what is your fs
1774,I ll send a message too see if they ll respond
1775,I ll prioritize on increasing factorofsafety
1776,ok let me know if you want to change something
1777,Im just trying to figure out how everything fits  We have to need to set certain parameters based on others
1778,same
1779,please do
1780,how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ? 
1781,ranges
1782,Mine range from  1   5  to  65  
1783,fllywheel says their mass is  12708  ? 
1784,yep just did
1785,thanks  can you try increasing it to around  97   5  or something  Im trying to see how it effects my numbers
1786,yep just did it
1787,sorry their factorofsafety
1788,Hey  how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ?  Ranges ? 
1789,with piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  150   flywheel  12  and shaft  60   we have a factorofsafety   12  above  2   but our mass is just a little high
1790,we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass
1791,they responded
1792,we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass
1793,with piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  150   flywheel  12  and shaft  60   we have a factorofsafety   12  above  2   but our mass is just a little high
1794,we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass
1795,with piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  150   flywheel  12  and shaft  60   we have a factorofsafety   12  above  2   but our mass is just a little high
1796,cool
1797,Will do
1798,we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass
1799,I think there is but I don t know how 
1800,with piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  150   flywheel  12  and shaft  60   we have a factorofsafety   12  above  2   but our mass is just a little high
1801, 0   57 
1802,I think that is a good idea
1803,okay cool everyone responded
1804,for the crankshaft
1805,okay cool everyone responded
1806,okay cool everyone responded
1807,okay cool everyone responded
1808,My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help
1809,terrible
1810,are we all selected ? 
1811,Lowering the diameter increases my factorofsafety by about  4  and increases mass by about  1 kg
1812,because any factorofsafety over like  10  shouldnt really effect the system right
1813,are we all selected ? 
1814,are we all selected ? 
1815,are we all selected ? 
1816,so increase factorofsafety for one component now ? 
1817,it seems so  yet we are still over the mass limit ? 
1818,right now my mass is at   69  and my factorofsafety is  3   84 
1819,Her  how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ? 
1820,keep other component variables constant ? 
1821,my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 
1822,are those variables L and r ? 
1823,my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 
1824,What are your ranges ? 
1825,have you figure out how pistonborediameter effects ur numbers
1826,my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 
1827,Definitely keep it smaller rather than larger
1828,I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages 
1829,yes  i think so
1830, 0   1  to  3   24  for mass   1   72  to  54   23  for factorofsafety 
1831,i have to choose the heaviest part now
1832,Yeah a lower pistonborediameter gives me better numbers
1833,yes  let s do one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety
1834,Okay  so your factorofsafety are in a slightly higher order
1835,or else the factorofsafety is very low
1836,for both factorofsafety and mass ? 
1837,let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety
1838,great
1839,hahaha
1840,let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety
1841,let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety
1842,like one part has huge factorofsafety so they just minimized mass bc the part has factorofsafety over  100  no matter what option they choose
1843,yeah that sounds like a good plan
1844,does the bore diameter pistonborediameter effect ur numbers ? 
1845,does the bore diameter pistonborediameter effect ur numbers ? 
1846,will do
1847,Okay  how about you try to increase your factorofsafety  prioritize that
1848,pass it on
1849,yes
1850,Mass increases  but only by about  1 kg at most and factorofsafety increases by about  4 
1851,masses go from around  1  to  4 
1852,can you try to reduce flywheelthickness at all
1853,The conrod asked me to change it to see how it affects the numbers  I think  82   5  will be the best
1854,I ve been talking with flywheel and he has very high mass ranges
1855,factorofsafety like   5  to  4 
1856,The value I mass at now is the lowest it can be without going below  1   5   As the crank lenght is changed  my values change though
1857,everything is good now but why is it still fair
1858,nope
1859,Makes sense  but when I improve mine the overall systems decreases 
1860,my masses are very small  and factorofsafety are  0   4 - 3   44 
1861,on it
1862,The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 
1863,what  ? 
1864,should I try to lean toward factorofsafety since my masses are about  1  to  4  and factorofsafety ranges are   5  to  3  ish ? 
1865,how
1866,nice  mine is a lower pistonborediameter gives lower mass and factorofsafety doesnt rly change
1867,Which is better for you ? 
1868,The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 
1869,I think the  82   5  is the best  let me know when you are okay for me to change it back 
1870,its actually at the minimum
1871,Ok great
1872,or like a mix since both my variable are pretty influential
1873,So I think lower pistonborediameter is better
1874,I changed my factorofsafety to around  30  by adding  0   07  kg
1875,reply when done
1876,okay  so let s try to get a high factorofsafety  as flywheel has huge masses  and they well work on mass reduction
1877,reply when done
1878,check
1879,Do you know how changing pistonborediameter effects your numbers ? 
1880,The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 
1881,done
1882,and we ve reached the global requirements
1883,The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 
1884,do you need my thickness to increase ? 
1885,do you have the  1   65  factorofsafety ? 
1886,do you have the  1   65  factorofsafety ? 
1887,ya go ahead and change it back  can you lower pistonborediameter any more ? 
1888,do you have the  1   65  factorofsafety ? 
1889,Sorry  t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length 
1890,I know its weird
1891,okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well
1892,Pick a threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
1893,okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well
1894,okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well
1895,okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well
1896,go back to what you had bc we were at very good
1897,oh nvm
1898,I mass thinking larger pistonborediameter makes my part heavier
1899,Same happened to me a bit ago
1900,great question  but it is all legitimate
1901,Lower pistonborediameter works better for both me and the rod designer  do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft ? 
1902,go back to what you had bc we were at good
1903,yall stay at where you are
1904,my part is a lot of the total weight
1905,ith piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  187   5   flywheel  12  and shaft  40   we have a factorofsafety below  2   but our mass is good  we were fair
1906,whenever some of you change parameters my weight and factorofsafety changes
1907,go back to what you had bc we were at good
1908,ill try decreasing my mass slightly
1909,Alright 
1910,okay so lower pistonborediameter is better ? 
1911,Where is the  change variables of other subsystems  button that it talks about in the handout ? 
1912,ith piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  187   5   flywheel  12  and shaft  40   we have a factorofsafety below  2   but our mass is good  we were fair
1913,ith piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  187   5   flywheel  12  and shaft  40   we have a factorofsafety below  2   but our mass is good  we were fair
1914,how about for factorofsafety
1915,go back to what you had we were at good
1916,ith piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  187   5   flywheel  12  and shaft  40   we have a factorofsafety below  2   but our mass is good  we were fair
1917,Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
1918,I ve had it at the first one  but it says you may need my thickness to change
1919,my masss is  6   28 
1920,i havent changed anything
1921,and i have leeway with my factor of safety
1922,does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high factorofsafety
1923,Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
1924,does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high factorofsafety
1925,Alright  b bearingoffset we have the given parameter LDr  equals to   1   2  and I have control of pistonborediameter
1926,I can lower it to  75 
1927,What is your range for pistonborediameter ? 
1928,im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
1929,factorofsafety is  2   85 
1930,Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
1931,im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
1932,oh okay  sounds good
1933,Yes  mass minimization is quite useless on my end  as my values are  0   02  -  0   12 
1934,does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high factorofsafety
1935,im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
1936,does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high factorofsafety
1937,DONT MOVE
1938,okay wait
1939,DONT CHANGE
1940,wait
1941,DONT CHANGE
1942,Should we do  75  for pistonborediameter or not so low
1943,wait
1944,dont change anything hahah
1945,wait
1946,Dont change 
1947,dont change anything hahah nice
1948,dont change anything hahah
1949,dont change anything hahah
1950,We just hit very good
1951,we are at excellent
1952,ya we just lowered it all the way  how are your numbers
1953,factorofsafety optimization would be best  Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low factorofsafety
1954,we are doing well right now
1955,gotcha
1956,gotcha
1957,says very good
1958,looking good
1959,says very good
1960,lets gooo
1961,dont move
1962,WE ARE AT EXCELLENT
1963,dont move
1964, 75 - 105 
1965,lowest mass I meant
1966,Okay  I think I have control of L and r 
1967,i did it  Looks a little closer but not quite there
1968, ? 
1969,enough money for me
1970,we are at very good right now
1971, 75  gives me  2   6 kg and  8   08 factorofsafety which I think is pretty good
1972,i dont want to mess it up
1973,I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? 
1974,ya the factorofsafety is so bad
1975,ayyyyyy
1976,nvm looks good
1977,I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? 
1978,factorofsafety is bad
1979,I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? 
1980,Let s try to get all the other engineers to work on high factorofsafety even if masses are high
1981,I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? 
1982,I have the  2 nd lowest possible mass selected for my part
1983,did it  we need to drop mass more still
1984,as their ranges are also pretty small
1985,I can hold mine above  2  and reduce but me having a high factorofsafety might brign the overall up for not much more mass
1986,why isnt this excellent ? 
1987,ok  Im just trying to figure out how it all works together  I was talking with someone else and sometimes when I optimize my part it hurts the overall system
1988,did it  need to drop more mass
1989,it doesnt impact it much  and my part is low mass so if i have to change it  that wont be a big deal
1990,did it  need to drop mass more
1991,What levels of mass are you dealing with ? 
1992,is there any way you can change your numbers to increase factorofsafety while keeping mass similar
1993,yeah i have the same questionb
1994,Bcause it changes other peoples factorofsafety properties
1995,We are hitting our requirements
1996,its bleow  40  and above  2 
1997,Rolid  really solid
1998,i have a really small mass  so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
1999,i have a really small mass  so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
2000,i have a really small mass  so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
2001,i have a really small mass  so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
2002,why isnt this exxcellent
2003,yo we got excellent
2004,its bleow  40  and above  2 
2005,i don t believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
2006,did it go up or down ? 
2007,yo we got excellent
2008,ok
2009,yo we got excellent
2010,yo we got excellent
2011,IT HAS US AT EXCELLENT NOW
2012,increases factorofsafety and mass
2013,what is your ms ? 
2014,like my factorofsafety just went from  1   9  to  2   2  without me changin anything for my part
2015,goal weight is actually  35 
2016,what is your ms ? 
2017,they updated it
2018,What is the relationship between those two and factorofsafety ?  For pistonborediameter  increasing it increases area and therefore the max gas force  but also will increase mass
2019,what is your ms ? 
2020,what is your ms ? 
2021,sounds good
2022, ;  
2023,i can get my mass between  0   5  and  0   6   and still have a pretty high factorofsafety
2024,hell yeah
2025,goal weight is actually  35 
2026,goal weight is actually  35 
2027,at excellent so dont change anything
2028,it went down
2029,goal weight is actually  35 
2030,Keep it steady we got excellent
2031,my ms is  1   0 
2032,excellent ? 
2033,excellent
2034,Keep it steady we got excellent
2035,we are at excellent now
2036,Keep it steady we got excellent
2037,what do you mean by ms
2038,so are we just done then ?  lol
2039,We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass 
2040,right now its  0   1  but it ranges from  0   01  to  0   1 
2041,mass ?  sorry  i am between  0   5  and  0   6 
2042,ok  are you then able to selkect a lower mass option ? 
2043,We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass 
2044,just  0   12 
2045,excellent
2046,select  
2047,We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass 
2048,I think we are done
2049,We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass 
2050,me too
2051,I will try that
2052,if you drop weight and i up the pin  we might still be ok
2053,I think we are good
2054,ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease
2055,ok
2056,record your current value
2057,I think we are done
2058,I think we are good if we get excellent maybe ? 
2059,factorofsafety is currently  1   23 
2060,ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease
2061,record your current value
2062,ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease
2063,record your current value
2064,ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease
2065,record your current value
2066,I mass broadcasting my lowest I got
2067,I think we are done
2068,perfect
2069,ok
2070,yay
2071,can we submit now ? 
2072,yes sir  or maam 
2073,perfect
2074,dont change 
2075,can we submit now ? 
2076,perfect
2077,now  1   46 
2078,dont change 
2079,can we submit now ? 
2080,yep i think so
2081,perfect
2082,can we submit now ? 
2083,dont change 
2084,could yo slightly lower your diamter again ? 
2085,we are pretty close
2086,gotcha
2087,sweeeeeet
2088,unless it drastically changes the mass
2089,ill ask
2090,i think so ? 
2091,how
2092,you got it
2093,For better or worse  want me to change mine and see how it affects yours real quick
2094,how do we submit ? 
2095,we got it 
2096,just wait it out
2097,No  looks like that L and r are different than mine 
2098,we got it 
2099,we got it 
2100,we got it 
2101,we have fair now
2102,idk
2103,nice fair 
2104,ask
2105,Sure 
2106,Fair 
2107,Fair 
2108,nice 
2109,someone changed thier mass
2110,What just changed ? 
2111,someone change thier mass
2112,who changed
2113,did you change ? 
2114,I could try
2115,someone changed thier mass
2116,i just reduced my mass
2117,Who changed ? 
2118,someone changed their amss
2119,did oyu change ? 
2120,mass
2121,who changed
2122,no
2123,who changed
2124,did you change something ? 
2125,I didn ; t change
2126,nope
2127,not me
2128,i didnt move
2129,who moved
2130,did you change something ? 
2131,wait we re at very good
2132,wait we re at very good
2133,i didnt
2134,wait we re at very good
2135,I don t know
2136,ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good
2137,No I didn t
2138,wait we re at very good
2139,idk i didnt change
2140,ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good
2141,did you change ? 
2142,ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good
2143,ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good
2144,did you change something ? 
2145,What just changed ? 
2146,or reduced offset i should say
2147,okay it shows us at very good  not excellent
2148,no
2149,What just changed ? 
2150,ok
2151,so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down
2152,I haven t changed anything
2153,PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 
2154,did you just change something ? 
2155,the mass went up
2156,PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 
2157,PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 
2158,PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 
2159,i dont htink piston did either
2160,just leave it im fine with very good
2161,if you did you need to go back
2162,what is going on
2163,Me neither  I think it was flywheel ? 
2164,just leave it im fine with very good
2165,just leave it im fine with very good
2166,did you change anything
2167,no just leave it im fine with very good
2168,i didnt touvch anything
2169,ok  whats the plan stan ? 
2170,Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better factorofsafety
2171,did you change something after excellent
2172,i asked
2173,we were at excellent but now its very good
2174,well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor
2175,well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor
2176,how did the mass go up
2177,ive been at the first broadcast for a while now
2178,well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor
2179,well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor
2180,how did the mass go up
2181,Did you change anything ? 
2182,nope
2183,just did
2184,whos changing things
2185,My factorofsafety went down I think 
2186,nope
2187,go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
2188,go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
2189,are you changing things
2190,mine still says fair
2191,idk 
2192,are you changing things rn
2193,go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
2194,go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
2195,okay well we were at excellent and the other guys swear they didn t change anything lol
2196,nah
2197,im not changing anything 
2198,no
2199,I didn t  and neither did crankshaft  I think flywheel did
2200,got it
2201,really ? 
2202,didnt touch anything
2203,i changed nothing
2204,i changed nothing
2205,hmm
2206,same  i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
2207,I haven t touched anything
2208,anything above a diamter of  47  gives me very low factorofsafety
2209,they said they ddnt
2210,I changed mine back
2211,i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
2212,Ok  that s odd
2213,Ok  that s odd
2214,i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
2215,I think tyhe  47   5  produced better results
2216,Ok  that s odd
2217,Ok  that s odd
2218,try to increase your factorofsafety
2219,whats your factorofsafety
2220,why
2221,whats your factorofsafety ? 
2222,i have no clue whats happening with that  my mass is too low to have an impact
2223,whats your factorofsafety ? 
2224,Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move
2225,Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move
2226,did you change anything ? 
2227,whats your factorofsafety
2228,Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move
2229, 2   85 
2230,Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move
2231, 3   91 
2232,I think so too
2233,It should be our lowest factorofsafety  but it s  0   51  instead of  2 
2234,ok
2235,This is strange
2236,Yeah we just need mass to go down
2237,yeah its fine i jsut want   17 
2238,my factorofsafety is over  4000 
2239,can you go lower in weight while still being high factorofsafety ? 
2240,i will stick with  47 
2241,my mass is  1   12 
2242,can you drop weight ? 
2243,just kidding  back to poor 
2244,its too low to have the impact it is having
2245,just kidding  back to poor 
2246,just kidding  back to poor 
2247,just kidding  back to poor 
2248,ok
2249,i ll look and see if there are any
2250, 2   06 
2251,We need factorofsafety to increase now
2252,what do you mean its   51 
2253,ok youre the minimum
2254,Global requirements top of page
2255,It was good for a second  what happened
2256,i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little  try to change your numbers slightly maybe ? 
2257,try not to change anything until you talk to someone
2258,have you heard anything from crankshaft ? 
2259,try not to change anything until you talk to someone
2260,i see mine hadnt updated yet
2261,yes  they are active
2262,the one i mass at now is the best one there is on the list
2263,Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 
2264,when i try to bump factorofsafety up it moves us from very good to good so im leaving it
2265,do you have any lower weight options above  2   06 
2266,What is your factorofsafety
2267,What is your factorofsafety
2268,so it looks like my max factorofsafety is  1   23  with  47 
2269,i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little  try to change your numbers slightly maybe ? 
2270,What is your factorofsafety
2271,what happended to our factorofsafety ? 
2272,my lowest factorofsafety is over  4000   crankshaft is the only person I would have to talk to 
2273,Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 
2274,is our global factorofsafety just the lowest part factorofsafety ? 
2275,what happended to our factorofsafety ? 
2276,hmm
2277,yeah
2278,what happended to our factorofsafety ? 
2279,what happended to our factorofsafety ? 
2280,If you changed anything since we got FAIR  please change it back  Then we can regroup and figure out next steps   sending this to everyone 
2281,If you changed anything since we got FAIR  please change it back  Then we can regroup and figure out next steps   sending this to everyone 
2282,If you changed anything since we got FAIR  please change it back  Then we can regroup and figure out next steps   sending this to everyone 
2283,and it keeps going down with larger piston diameter ? 
2284,If you changed anything since we got FAIR  please change it back  Then we can regroup and figure out next steps   sending this to everyone 
2285,no ive checked
2286,yep
2287,If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with factorofsafety less then  2 
2288,who moved we are at poor now
2289,man what happened
2290,you could try increasing pistonborediameter a little and see what happens overall
2291,i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2 
2292,im so confused what happened
2293, 3   62 
2294,ok
2295,if someone can decrease their mass by   9 
2296,no idea  our mass is way too high and factorofsafety too low
2297,I can decrease my mass by   19 kg but that brings my factorofsafety down  1   49 
2298,i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 
2299,it doesnt matter if youre not the min factorofsafety
2300,i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 
2301,i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 
2302,Mine is still same
2303,I pistonborediameter like to keep it at  47  since that help connecting rod
2304,WHO THE HELL KEEPS MOVING IT TO POOR
2305,wut
2306,nah dont do that
2307,says very good still
2308,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2309,i can increase my mass by increasing thickness
2310,its fine now
2311,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2312,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2313, ? 
2314,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2315,by about   7  or  1 
2316,it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
2317,I told everyone that  but I think connector tod and piston pin guys left
2318,I mass trying to find out what everyone s factorofsafety is  crankshafter has theirs at  3   62 
2319,same
2320,I am staying at mass  0   07  and fs  1   23 
2321,update back to very good
2322,what really ? 
2323,alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past  1   23  factorofsafety
2324,We need an factorofsafety of  1   5 
2325,Any way to increase factorofsafety ? 
2326,nobofy left the room did they ? 
2327,that s a requirement
2328,got it
2329,you there
2330,Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety
2331,whats your factorofsafety if you dropped mass by  3 kg
2332, 2  is for expecially good design
2333,whats your factorofsafety
2334,it costs money
2335,whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg
2336,my highest factorofsafety is  1   23 
2337,they just not responding to messages ? 
2338, 1   23  is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter
2339,okay mine is  3   84 
2340,Mine still says fair  mass equals to  2   96   factorofsafety equals to  1   73   I can increase mass by  0   28   but increase factorofsafety by  2   63   Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least   28  tho
2341,whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg
2342,Mine still says fair  mass equals to  2   96   factorofsafety equals to  1   73   I can increase mass by  0   28   but increase factorofsafety by  2   63   Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least   28  tho
2343,the values range as other engineers alter their broadcasted values
2344,Mine still says fair  mass equals to  2   96   factorofsafety equals to  1   73   I can increase mass by  0   28   but increase factorofsafety by  2   63   Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least   28  tho
2345,Mine still says fair  mass equals to  2   96   factorofsafety equals to  1   73   I can increase mass by  0   28   but increase factorofsafety by  2   63   Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least   28  tho
2346,someones has to be that   5  though right
2347,im at  1   23  factorofsafety as well and cant get above that unless we change piston diamter to  40 
2348, 1   23 
2349,That makes no sense
2350,Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw
2351,that s the highest
2352, 3   03 
2353,our global factorofsafety just the lowest part factorofsafety you think
2354,Is there anything you can do to reduce mass without changing factorofsafety much ? 
2355,how do i checkt that
2356,Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw
2357,can you go higher now ? 
2358, 1   14 
2359,Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw
2360,nevermind I mass being stupid
2361,on your list 
2362,Are you there
2363,my mass is minimized rn
2364,bad ok dont do that
2365,yeah 
2366,It does  if one of the engineers changes their dimensions mine are forced to change
2367,Is your factorofsafety really low ? 
2368,tell them that 
2369,Yeah i figured that out when mine was lowest lol
2370,i think ive optimized my part
2371,bueno
2372,we reached good
2373,piston pin has theirs at  1   23  and says that s their highest option
2374,yep raised it
2375,hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by   28 
2376,but yes  we need to keep track of where we are
2377,we reached good
2378,itll say your current mass  find the one thats  3  kg lower and then find the factorofsafety
2379,GOOD
2380,WE are GOOD
2381,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2382,i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety
2383,in order to optimize our results
2384,We are GOOD
2385,GOOD 
2386,With  0   12  mass 
2387,me too
2388,GOOD 
2389,if one of the other values changes  does it give you more options ?  Like if pistonborediameter increased or decreased ? 
2390,GOOD
2391,nice
2392,who is in charge of piston pin
2393,we re at good
2394,nice
2395,our mass is the only thing to change now
2396,i drop to   97  factorofsafety
2397,I say we stop changing
2398,you ? 
2399,nobody touch anything haha
2400,ok dont do that
2401,so i dont want to change
2402,nobody touch anything haha
2403,I have  3   03  with mass of  0   12  
2404,nobody touch anything haha
2405,cool  not touching anything
2406,nobody touch anything haha
2407,No
2408,oh dang
2409,No we re not good
2410,cool  not touching anything
2411,I think  75  is the best right now
2412,cool  not touching anything
2413,if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an factorofsafety of over  2  that chould do it
2414,I have factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  with mass  equals to   0   12  
2415,HEllo
2416,nvmd
2417,cool  not touching anything
2418,im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety
2419,refresh it
2420,im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety
2421,im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety
2422,ok
2423,im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety
2424,Rod designer still here
2425,i agree haha
2426,Only change something if it will lower mass and keep fs greater than  2 
2427,we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
2428,but that might change the system actually
2429,so youre at the value that is closest to  2  factorofsafety 
2430,so nevermind haha
2431,as someone changes their values  all other fvalues are forced to change
2432, 2   06  right
2433,or maybe two or three are tied
2434,Yeah that s what im trying to find out
2435,my individual factorofsafety is in the range of  2000   not sure how to compare that to  2 factorofsafety on a system wide level
2436,I don t think any of them will be high enough if I drop any mass
2437,but we have a good design
2438,sorry I was distracted by other teammates 
2439,all good
2440,do you need me to change my thickness or anything like that ?  changing my thickness only affects my mass by  1   5  kg max if it helps you out with mass
2441, 2   03 factorofsafety is about the factorofsafety we can do and still be very good   excellent  we need to drop the mass
2442, 2   03 factorofsafety is about the factorofsafety we can do and still be very good   excellent  we need to drop the mass
2443, 2   03 factorofsafety is about the factorofsafety we can do and still be very good   excellent  we need to drop the mass
2444, 2   03 factorofsafety is about the factorofsafety we can do and still be very good   excellent  we need to drop the mass

2453,hello
2454,hello
2455,hello
2456,hello
2457,The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
2458,whaddup
2459,who r u
2460,wassup
2461,maybe we need to be secret
2462,I only care about the crankshaft persons decisions
2463,hi
2464,what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under  35 
2465,what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under  35 
2466,what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under  35 
2467,what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under  35 
2468,What are you working on ? 
2469,What are you working on ? 
2470,What are you working on ? 
2471,What are you working on ? 
2472,yo bro
2473,we gotta talk
2474,piston- pin designer
2475,I chose a t _ f  equals to   12   0  and pistonborediameter _ s  equals to   60   0 
2476,The piston can be any value between  3  and  15 kg
2477,Im working on the connecting rod  Honestly just trying to figure out how to start
2478,What value of the piston diameter should I use ? 
2479,hows it going
2480,What about you ? 
2481,our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me  can you try and get them to talk to me  :   I need to discuss values with them
2482,ive got you at  75 
2483,so what might effect you is the diameter of the pin
2484, ? 
2485,i mass trying to minimize the mass of crankshaft and factor of safety
2486,bearingoffset equals to  150 
2487,i determine bearingoffset and dc
2488,sure
2489,yeah the pin is pretty light  shouldnt be an issue
2490,Im working on the piston
2491,trying to max factorofsafety and min weight
2492,what are you working on ? 
2493,hey the flywheel guy needs some info from you
2494,trying to max factorofsafety and min weight
2495,Thank you
2496,kk ill test
2497,trying to max factorofsafety and min weight of the piston
2498,we are  1   94  over mass rn
2499,yeah
2500,we are  1   94  over mass rn
2501,dwhat is your current piston bore diameter ? 
2502,we are  1   94  over mass rn
2503,honestly the best bet for me would be a factorofsafety of above two and make the smallest weight possible
2504,my stats for flywheel are as follow
2505,my graphs don t show up so i mass somewhat limited
2506,we are  1   94  over mass rn
2507,The highest performance is at  3   91  factorofsafety and  5   2 mass
2508,hi  what are you working on ? 
2509,t _ f  equals to   12   0  and pistonborediameter _ s  equals to   60   0 
2510,yea I can lower the mass of the piston  I have it set at  8   84 kg right now
2511,its t _ h  equals to   4  and pistonborediameter  equals to   75 
2512,mass  equals to   1   27  and f _ os  equals to   15886   04 
2513,i have mass for the shaft at  18   63   fs equals to  2   06 
2514,Yeah  what parameters are you designing for ? 
2515,The bore diameter ? 
2516,mine also
2517,Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all ? 
2518,Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all ? 
2519,pistonborediameter  equals to   75 
2520,updated my mass to  1   19 
2521,updated my mass to  1   19 
2522,Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all ? 
2523,we at very good rn im happy with that
2524,maybe ?  what is yours
2525,f _ os  equals to   9193   31 
2526,yes  i design the bearingoffset and dc
2527,we at very good rn im happy with that
2528,f _ os  equals to   9193   31 
2529,Trying to figure out what s happening
2530,f _ os  equals to   9193   31 
2531,we at very good rn im happy with that
2532,mass  equals to   1   19 
2533,we at very good rn im happy with that
2534,What is the bearing offset ?  it just says  60  and I don t know if you have changed it
2535,You ? 
2536,we can tone it down some still
2537,Whats your current diameter ? 
2538,I dont believe so
2539,we can tone it down some still
2540,trying to max factorofsafety and min weight
2541,my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize factorofsafety
2542,we can tone it down some still
2543,same
2544,cool
2545,wanna shoot for excellent ?   : P
2546,yea what we have right now is perfect
2547,duh
2548,wanna shoot for excellent ?   : P
2549,wanna shoot for excellent ?   : P
2550,my current bearingoffset i  150  and dc of  30 
2551,lets try only small changes now since we are at very good  maybe make it to excellent
2552,just remember what you have now
2553, 60  ia the current value
2554,is 
2555,just remember what you have now
2556,just remember what you have now
2557,can try small changes
2558,just remember what you have now
2559,I mass trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
2560, is
2561,if we could take off  2  kgs wed be golden
2562,we are very good
2563,hi  what are your working on ? 
2564,bro are you alive
2565,helloooo
2566,Ok let me know if you change that because it will effect my design
2567,I mass trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
2568,ok just making sure it updates
2569,At  75  diameter for me  the best I have is  2   85 factorofsafety and  6   26 mass
2570,yea my bad  I ve got  7   15 kg right now
2571,we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs
2572,ok somehow we now have way too much mass
2573,You ? 
2574,piston diameter  pistonborediameter  is currently  105   not variable I control
2575,since we are at the threshold for fs
2576,ok somehow we now have way too much mass
2577,minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize factorofsafety
2578,I am working on setting the thickness of the I section of the connecting rod and the Conrod length to crank length ratio  What about you ? 
2579,ok somehow we now have way too much mass
2580,i mass determining dc and bearingoffset
2581,ok somehow we now have way too much mass
2582,I haven t changed anything yet
2583,Whats your current diameter ? 
2584,Have you chosen a crankshaft bearing offset ? 
2585,my bad  thanks
2586,how much does the crankshaft currently weigh ? 
2587,how much does the connecting rod currently weigh ? 
2588,let me know if you need anything from me
2589,Hello I currently am discussing with a  75  diameter piston
2590, 2   31 
2591,there is a default one but i mass trying to figure out how to change it
2592,ok who will my t _ h or piston head thickness affect ? 
2593,minimize the weight of crankshaft and increase factorofsafety
2594,yea  idk who changed a value  If we cant figure it out  I can lower the piston  4  pounds
2595,kg
2596,i mass determining bearingoffset and dc
2597,Are you able to change the length and diameter of the piston ? 
2598,I didn t change
2599,Do you need any info from me ? 
2600,Do you need any info from me ? 
2601, 40  inches 
2602,What is your current analysis ? 
2603,Im not sure  the only thing that effects me is the bore diameter
2604,thanks
2605,Maybe ask around
2606,Do you need any info from me ? 
2607,ok will do
2608,what variables affect your decisions
2609,I dont have those variables on my diagrams  what do they represent ? 
2610,Do you have direct control over piston diameter  pistonborediameter  ? 
2611,what variables affect you
2612, 18   63 
2613,ok back to very good i say leabe it
2614,how much does the fly wheel weigh ? 
2615,Crankshaft bearing offset
2616,ok guys looks good
2617,I have broadcasted the best value
2618,ok guys looks good
2619,ok back to very good i say leabe it
2620,what is the piston bore
2621,I can chang the diameter
2622,ok guys looks good
2623,I have broadcasted the best value
2624,ok back to very good i say leabe it
2625,ok guys looks good
2626,ok back to very good i say leabe it
2627,I have broadcasted the best value
2628,What about you
2629,I have broadcasted the best value
2630,we got it
2631,ok thats not me then  maybe ask around
2632,Yes
2633,flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and pistonborediameter
2634,and t _ h  which may be the length
2635,we re at excellent
2636,The piston has a diameter of  75 
2637,exellent dont touch
2638,Yeah I mass talking to the crankshaft
2639,someone touched it
2640,exellent dont toucu
2641,awesome
2642,yuppppp
2643,or we were for a second
2644,the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 
2645,ok I change pistonborediameter right now its still  75 
2646,do you have the piston bore diameter
2647,the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 
2648,and a tH of  10   5 
2649,I have not selected anything yet  Still looking through my options
2650,bearingoffset is bearing support offset
2651,agreed
2652,do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
2653,dc is crank-pin diameter
2654, 40  inches currently
2655,the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 
2656,Which part do you think has the most mass ?  mine is small but i can chang factorofsafety a lot
2657,i mass having the best value now
2658,alright we re at very good  I say lets leave it at this
2659,and flywheel thickness
2660,ayyy the status is good somehow
2661,we just had excellent but someone touched it
2662,we need to decrease the mass
2663,we need to decrease the mass
2664,we need to decrease the mass
2665,we need to decrease the mass
2666,We re at very good  I say we leave it at this
2667,agreed
2668,we got excellent
2669,same here
2670,Actually its better now
2671,Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
2672,we got excellent
2673,Yeah  Im on the second lightest option
2674,Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
2675,Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
2676,we got excellent
2677,the mass of the piston is currently  2   23 
2678,Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
2679,we got excellent
2680,For the flywheel shaft diameter i have  10 
2681,Okay I ll let you know what I get
2682,Yeah
2683,I can change diameter if needed
2684,we finished now ? 
2685,sweet we re at excellent
2686,we finished now ? 
2687,we finished now ? 
2688,Its excellent now
2689,Yeah
2690,ranges from 0   45  to  4   43 
2691,For the diameter it is  25  right now
2692,yea we re at excellent
2693,cool we should be good then
2694,lets leave it like this
2695,Sweet we re at excellent quality rn
2696,cool
2697,so hows life
2698,I mass on the lightest option  but if I go up at all we ll go over  3 
2699,Ok  mine is only   5   Idk how factorofsafety works but mine goes above  5 k
2700,perfect  thank you
2701,nice
2702,I can try lower mass  however pistonborediameter will need to increase to compensate for the reduced factorofsafety
2703,lmk what you think
2704,lmk what you think
2705,lmk what you think
2706,great  done then
2707,so hows life
2708,great  done then
2709,Thank you
2710,great  done then
2711,what was the diameter you use ? 
2712,so hows life
2713,Thank you
2714,no problem
2715,We can make that happen
2716,factorofsafety should be around  5  for everyone  Making it larger doesn t seem to help the sub-system factorofsafety
2717,I think were good  We are at the highest point we can be  Good job 
2718,haha good can t wait to go work on this lab
2719,awesome  go team
2720,What is your mass ?  I can increase factorofsafety but I can t decrease mass much more  its only   5 
2721,pistom-pin designer says increase the diameter
2722,gotta love it
2723, however pistonborediameter will need to increase to compensate for the reduced factorofsafety 
2724,cool
2725,i havent really started yet
2726,the bearingoffset and dc i currently have yields best factorofsafety which is  2   283  but it s not the lightest
2727,mine only goes up to  30  max
2728,I dont think those effect my design  Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else
2729,thats fine we already have the highest rating with an acceptable factorofsafety
2730,I spent a lot of time staring at it questioning my basic knowledge of engineering so I pistonborediameter recommend starting haha
2731,i could change so that it have factorofsafety of  2  but weights  2  kg lighter
2732,keep me posted on your diameter broadcast so I can update mine
2733,I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently
2734,sounds good
2735,ive got a factorofsafety of  3   91   lets see if we can get it further above  2 
2736,check with the others
2737,for my component
2738,you can change it and change it back if it gets worse
2739,The weight will go over if I increase diameter
2740,Higher offset lowers my factorofsafety a lot just fyi
2741,yup  will do  ;  
2742,weight let me update my design
2743,i haven t updated
2744,pretty good  how about yourself
2745,How s the design going ?  I think we got to an excellent rating already 
2746,wait 
2747,How s the design going ?  I think we got to an excellent rating already 
2748,Not too bad  not excited for the lab
2749,i updated
2750,Don t worry  you re a pistonpin you can do anything
2751,i updated my design
2752,If i increase diameter we go over weight  Still on lowest setting
2753,What range of masses can you use ? 
2754,ok so your mass should be fine  not a big contributing factor
2755,it got worse so i would change it back
2756,i think we should just leave it
2757,I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter  I got these values by setting pistonborediameter  equals to   45 
2758,have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft ? 
2759,did you change the mass ? 
2760,mass shot up  we back to very good did you change
2761,your variables affect the other measurements
2762,ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve factorofsafety some with other parts
2763,Someone just changed something
2764,I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? 
2765,I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? 
2766,i didnt change anything
2767,mass shot up  we back to very good did you change
2768,mass shot up  we back to very good did you change
2769,did any mass values change ? 
2770,If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit
2771,dont change it theyre changing it back
2772,did any mass values change ? 
2773,Ok  60  is my lowest possible so I ll leave it at that
2774,Let s not change whatever we have
2775,have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft ? 
2776,Let s not change whatever we have
2777,  45 - 5 
2778,did any mass values change ? 
2779,Let s not change whatever we have
2780,Let s not change whatever we have
2781,let me change around and see what i got
2782,I haven t touched any
2783,me neither  poor now
2784,woah were at poor now
2785,Wait we ve gone down to poor quality now
2786,I mass on  0   69  now with a factorofsafety of  3   84 
2787,yeah  I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can
2788,everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
2789,everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
2790,now poor
2791,well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more
2792,everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
2793,everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
2794,the one we currently have is the default
2795,keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it
2796,the factorofsafety is quit low
2797,I have not
2798,Yeah I won t
2799,I didnt
2800,agree
2801,if any of your values changed go back to what it was
2802,What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
2803,Crankshaft asked for bore diameter  Thats all
2804,I have piston diameter
2805,i didnt change
2806,Is there anything I can do to help you ? 
2807,go back to the value you had and itll go back
2808,pistonborediameter equals to   47   4  or  40  for me
2809,are you changing stuff ? 
2810,Dont change your values from when we had the high score
2811,ok good  I would just assume your part has the most mass
2812,it s poor again lol
2813,I mass using  47   5 
2814,rn is very
2815,very good
2816,right now
2817,what value are you using because my design is dependant on that value
2818,Yeah we were at excellent but we ve gone back down to poor now somehow
2819,We need to save weight 
2820,I had it at mass  equals to   0   04  and f  equals to   0   74  when the status of the engine was good
2821,Someone changed something
2822,we had excelent at one point
2823,i updated another design
2824,No  I only have one good value  No experimentation required
2825,im at what ive always been at
2826,My mass range is around  0   02  to   12 
2827,I got good results with  55   but trying to bring down the mass
2828,are you at that value again
2829,Will do I wrote them down
2830,I have not chnaged anything
2831,im at what ive always been at
2832,I mass looking for the lowest mass with highest factorofsafety right now
2833, 47   5 
2834,im at what ive always been at
2835,Is there anything I can do to help you ? 
2836,great
2837,then it was not me
2838,Does youyr part depend on my values ? 
2839,I agree
2840,we had  good  at one point didnt we ? 
2841,we had  good  at one point didnt we ? 
2842,It wasn t me or the piston  Ive recorded my values in case something happens
2843,we had  good  at one point didnt we ? 
2844,yeah same
2845,what ranges of mass do you have for your part ? 
2846,we had  good  at one point didnt we ? 
2847,ok i ll ask around
2848,I havn t changed it since the beginning
2849,We did
2850,Do you need to know what the thickness of I-section or Conrod length is because I am in charge of choosing those variables ? 
2851, 40   70 
2852,yea we need to figure out whos value changed
2853,Yeah same here
2854,What is your piston bore diameter right now
2855,I have lowest mass currently without making factorofsafety poor
2856,same
2857,hello ? 
2858,yes
2859,Do you need to know what the thickness of I-section or Conrod length is because I am in charge of choosing those variables ? 
2860,do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters ? 
2861,The crankshaft changed something
2862,yea we need to figure out whos value changed
2863,do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters ? 
2864,nah i dont think that would change the varialbes for me
2865,I dont believe so
2866,ok mine is like   5 - 1  so im trying to change factorofsafety more
2867,Ok  is he working on fixing it ? 
2868,wait i thought you were talkingabout diameter
2869,Nope must be the other two that need that
2870,someone changed it again
2871,someone changed it again
2872,at some point  need to get mass down
2873,someone changed it again
2874,my bad lol the range of mass is like  0     0   1  ish
2875,someone changed it again
2876,He changed it and it went to very good
2877,But it s back to poor now again
2878,i did
2879,Are you changing youre values ? 
2880,I am not sure  haven t heard from fly wheel or crankshaft
2881,I mean something changed and made it go back down to very good  but I didn t change anything  did you ? 
2882,Are you changing youre values ? 
2883,i was trying to see which design was better
2884, your
2885,I imagine these would contribute to more mass
2886, your
2887,we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 
2888,someone is changing stuff
2889,I may change it back to  55  though if that works with yours 
2890,What are your values now ? 
2891,not me
2892,my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 
2893,yes
2894,I remember the parameter I had
2895,my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 
2896,Are you changing stuff ? 
2897,are you changing
2898,hmm ok I ll check around
2899,my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 
2900,we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 
2901,I didnt change anything
2902,we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 
2903,at that  I can get mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  which are good values
2904,whats the range of mass you have ? 
2905,no I am just refreshing
2906,we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 
2907,just changed it to  25  pistonborediameter and t is  10 
2908,That s where it was when we got the result as good
2909,Ok
2910,ok
2911,Okay we are good now
2912,sweet
2913,nah
2914,The conrod hasn t changed anything
2915,can we make it better ? 
2916,bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 
2917,no I got my best value
2918, 0   45  kg to  4   43 
2919,got em
2920,Okay we are at
2921,The crankshaft designed is changing values
2922,this is as good as i can get i think
2923, Good 
2924,ok neither have i
2925,what variables do you depend on ? 
2926,what variables do you control ? 
2927,i see that
2928,ok yeah so really small  I was just wondering why mass was so high
2929,this is as good as i can get
2930, ? 
2931,based on the current values  it should say excellent
2932,they said they didnt change it
2933,Who changed it
2934,any updates ? 
2935,yep 
2936,oh damn mine is  0   0   06  when i put diameter as  50 
2937,based on the current values  it should say excellent
2938,i mass trying to minimize weight while keeping factorofsafety around  2 
2939,based on the current values  it should say excellent
2940,Okay let s keep it at that then
2941,not me
2942,based on the current values  it should say excellent
2943,Who changed it
2944,piston range is pretty high
2945,bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
2946,try making your factorofsafety high because i think that is really hurting the oveerall factorofsafety
2947,Are you chnaging anything ? 
2948,do you control flywheeldiameter ? 
2949,you should probably ask him her
2950, 47   5 
2951,no we need mass below  35 
2952,Ok cool  Do you need any values from me ? 
2953,ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
2954,thinking about changing it to  55 
2955,i was at t equals to  10  and pistonborediameter equals to  15  or  20 
2956,or is there anything else you control
2957,ok thx
2958,ok
2959,ok if its the same as what we had at excellent then it should be fine but it isnt
2960,my current value is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 
2961,ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
2962,Remember the simulation you have selected right now in case we need to go back
2963,any ideas to get bumped up
2964,only one i use is bearingoffset
2965,what are your weight and factorofsafety values
2966,ok
2967,we are at  Good  now
2968,Yeah they said they re not going to change it now
2969,let me know if you do
2970,Ok  any luck getting it back to excellent ? 
2971,at  47   5  or  55  ? 
2972,do your projected outputs change when an update happens ? 
2973,what are your weight and factorofsafety values
2974,what are your weight and factorofsafety values
2975,No I have not
2976,what are your weight and factorofsafety values
2977,hey what are your values ? 
2978,nah its above  35 
2979, 18   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   06 
2980,what variables do you depend on
2981,ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
2982,I am simply sitting here
2983,what is your current flywheeldiameter
2984,I do the control flywheeldiameter but its the same
2985,ok still at  60 
2986,ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
2987,flywheeldiameter  equals to   50 
2988,crankshaft is talking  but he she depends on flywheel
2989,where are you getting that info
2990,Who changed it
2991,me too
2992,Who changed it
2993,I think you and I have the most influence over total mass  What is your current mass and factorofsafety ? 
2994,the highest factorofsafety rn for me is  0   89 
2995,that wasnt me
2996,what is the variable you put
2997,that wasnt me
2998,why did it go down ? 
2999,no they remain the same
3000, 37   46  and  2   06 
3001,that wasnt me
3002,I think the flywheel is changing
3003,that wasnt me
3004,ok i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 
3005,looks like mass dropped a lot
3006,I have not touched mine
3007,my second option is mass  equals to   20   55  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   83 
3008,I cant get a response tho
3009,is flywheel talking greater than 
3010, ? 
3011,It just changed back to good
3012,Talking with crankshaft since we need to coordinate on mass
3013,I did and piston should be low now  rod is only a mass of   14 
3014, 37   49  kg and  2   06 
3015,damn
3016,mass  1   83  and factorofsafety  1   92 
3017,i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 
3018,i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 
3019,Our mass keeps going up
3020,i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 
3021,same
3022,I have not changed mine
3023,the plot on the white board
3024, 4   42  and  10   19 
3025,probably
3026,What is your current mass ? 
3027,i meant for your individual part
3028,can you reduce factorofsafety a bit and reduce the weight ? 
3029,i meant for your part
3030,gave me dimensions earlier
3031,factorofsafety greater than  2  and mass lesser than  35 
3032,Is there any information I could give you that could help your design ? 
3033,ill try
3034,flywheel guy was that you
3035,gives excellent
3036,I think the flywheel keeps changing values  I cant get a response tho
3037,i wouldnt up your weight
3038,the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get factorofsafety to like  0   89 
3039,what variable can you change for  change variables of other sub-systems ?  
3040,what variable do you control ? 
3041, 0   1 
3042,are the dimensions still the same
3043,smallest
3044,so maybe try lowering your factorofsafety a lil bit with smaller mass
3045,oh I see
3046,i know  my design is basically fixed
3047,I control tH and pistonborediameter of the piston
3048,Yeah I don t know how 
3049,Mass  5   2  factorofsafety  3   91 
3050,okay
3051,I mass at Mass  0   69  and factorofsafety  3   84   We need to find some more weight to up your factorofsafety
3052, 47   5 
3053,pistonborediameter back to  10  now because factorofsafety is high
3054,oh there we go
3055,Did you change something ? 
3056,the alternetives are either increase weight by a bunch or decrease factorofsafety by a lot
3057,yes
3058,its the flywheel guy
3059,I think you need to try changing that variable and seeing if you can get a higher factorofsafety
3060,Ok we re doing well  We re at good s
3061,yeah i see that
3062,what s your current value ? 
3063,its the flywheel guy
3064,yeah for sure him
3065,our weight is the high bit
3066,very close now
3067,agreed
3068,For lower mass I could make it  40   it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn t affect factorofsafety as much
3069,our weight is the high bit
3070,our weight is the high bit
3071,getting close
3072,Increase your mass slightly
3073,hello ? 
3074,I have my best broadcast for the available thing
3075,Hold where you are
3076,Its the lowest mass with an factorofsafety above  2 
3077,I think you re right
3078,have you changed the bore diameter ? 
3079,Hold where you are
3080,if you change the diameter to  65 
3081,agreed
3082,for my parts
3083,how much does the mass increase ? 
3084,We are going back up 
3085,are you changing the variables ? 
3086,but were at v good
3087,ok we re close
3088,No  You have the lowest factorofsafety at  1   92  currently
3089,ok we re close
3090,okay can di
3091,cool thats good
3092,ok we re close
3093,do 
3094,The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by  0   03 
3095,ok we re close
3096,yes  we need to system wide reduce weight
3097,I have the best broadcast available for my thing
3098,TRUE
3099,while keeping the factorofsafety fixed
3100,What is your current mass ? 
3101,heloooo
3102,What is your current mass ? 
3103,large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better
3104,What is your current mass ? 
3105,Are you changing stuff or is it still the crankshaft
3106,What is your current mass ? 
3107,large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better
3108,mine is a diameter and i think it relates to piston
3109,yea lets not change any more variables
3110,large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better
3111,we just had excellent for a bit so I was trying to see what we could better
3112,large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better
3113,I have my best broadcast for the available thing
3114,try decreasing the weight while keeping factorofsafety the same
3115,current mass is  0   01  with factorofsafety  0   1 
3116,I have my best broadcast for the available thing
3117,ok
3118,Do you need me to change anything ? 
3119,whats the name of the diameter ? 
3120, 2   26  and  2   5 
3121,at  62   5  the mass goes up from  1   89  to  2   94 
3122,I changed factorofsafety but not the diamter
3123,  53  and was   52 
3124,Make sure your part s factorofsafety isnt the same as the sub system s  If it is  increase it slightly
3125, 1   62  kg
3126,anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the factorofsafety too much ? 
3127,now we are at poor again 
3128,my design is basically fixed  i found a good design that have decent factorofsafety but not too heavy
3129,I am at my lowest mass possible
3130,Can you increase mass slightly ? 
3131,try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
3132,I am at my lowest mass possible
3133,piston diameter
3134,DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
3135,DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
3136,DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
3137,as i increase it I can increase factorofsafety some
3138,DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
3139,for my part or the whole thing ? 
3140,decreasing mass is gonna decrease my factorofsafety
3141,we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
3142,Increase
3143,no  i got my best value now
3144,what are the values you put
3145,we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
3146,we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
3147,very bad change
3148,same here
3149,same same
3150,okay so the piston and I also have that variable and we have it at  47   5  currently
3151,the only person changing values is the flywheel
3152, increaseing
3153,your part
3154,communication is key my brotha
3155,was that you ? 
3156,no
3157,My strategy was to pick the part with lowest weight and factor of safety above  2 
3158,yeah i just sent that to everyone
3159,I ve just been clicking refresh for the last  20  minutes haha
3160,I was asked to keep my parameters constant
3161,bad change  not me
3162,i guess it s the system messing with us lol
3163,same lmao
3164,So your mass is the largest contributor by far  can we reduce that at all ? 
3165,was that you ? 
3166,ok
3167,we had excellent until someone changed it
3168,Ok  i was just wondering if any of my parameters need to be entered into your catalog to get the correct mass and factorofsafety values
3169,Don t use a factorofsafety of higher than like  5 
3170,same and im currently there
3171, :  
3172,I haven t changed in  5  mins
3173,what mass are you working with ? 
3174,the new design looks real good
3175,I mass not sure what happened  but if you need me to change anything  let me know  From here all I can do is increase factorofsafety and mass  but we don t need that
3176,shoot
3177, 1   31 
3178,so close
3179, 0   1 
3180,the new design looks real good
3181,Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio ? 
3182,its the smallest I can go
3183,it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
3184,Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio ? 
3185,Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio ? 
3186,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3187,but no one changed anything i believe
3188,I have my diameter set to  40   but that has likely changed since I last chacked
3189,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3190,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3191,nope dont thing so
3192,I think both of us are good
3193,i have mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety at  1   23 
3194,Did you just change something ? 
3195,You dont need a conrod length to crank length ratio ? 
3196,if i go for a lower mass we don t pass the factorofsafety
3197,Did you just change something ? 
3198,sounds good
3199,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3200,what diameter are you sitting at ? 
3201,Flywheel isn t communicating thats the problem
3202,I know 
3203,Yeah I tried decreasing the weight
3204,Ok
3205,I think you need to change your bearingoffset value
3206,oops sorry for the repeat
3207,Did you just change something greater than 
3208,agreed
3209,i have diameter at  47   5 with mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   23 
3210,to  150 
3211, ? 
3212,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3213,no i don t need that
3214,diameter pistonborediameter has been at  40  whole time
3215,that is a lot  between you and the piston  you guys have the majority of the weight
3216,the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
3217,Hi how is it going ? 
3218,mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   23 
3219,What are your settings now ? 
3220,Okay sounds good
3221,under variables of other subsystems
3222,this is what i ahve rn
3223,it is at  150 
3224,clarify flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness numbers
3225,can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
3226,lol sorry for the repeat
3227,dc at  45 
3228,no nothing affects me
3229,the systemwide weight is kinda high
3230,that is the best I can get
3231,if we could decrease for another  2  kg we should get excellent
3232,I was testing the lower diameter for less mass  Changed it back now
3233,thats getting better  Im working w the piston to find the best pistonborediameter and will let you konw when we do
3234,mas is up pretty high
3235,Yeah thats because our parts are heavy
3236,can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? 
3237,I agree  I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent  I have not changed my variables  I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
3238,sounds good
3239,thickness is  10 
3240,I cant decrease the weight without decreasing the facto of safety below  2 
3241,can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? 
3242,what is your mass ? 
3243,haha yea fingers crossed it stays at very good
3244,can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? 
3245,No I mass using the crankshaft bearing offset
3246,could you lower the mass by  2  kg without skrewing the factorofsafety
3247,diameter is  25 
3248,can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? 
3249,I can reduce it by lowering diameter or thickness which lowers my factorofsafety
3250,Yeah flywheel isn t communicating
3251,I mass asking around
3252,I mass at the  4 headthickness lowest weight I can be at out of  25  options
3253,yes  pistonborediameter from  20  to  15 
3254,I choose the part with lowest mass and factorofsafety above  2 
3255,not me  at lowest weight possible
3256, 1   27 
3257,Ok
3258, 1   36 
3259,i can get higher factorofsafety with relatively low mass so maybe we can leverage this
3260,i mass asking around rn
3261,I cant
3262,ok cool
3263,try to find a combo that gets you just above  2  factorofsafety but the lowest mass
3264,can youget it lower ? 
3265,same here
3266,Do you have a factor of safety above  2   06  ? 
3267,I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
3268,ok sounds good
3269,can you get the mass lower ? 
3270,the weight increased for some reason
3271,Keep your factorofsafety above  2 
3272,Oh ok  Because we went back to poor
3273,Keep your factorofsafety above  2 
3274, :   3   25  ;   :   40   0  ;   :   0   69  ;   :   3   84  ; 
3275,flywheel no word at all
3276,sitting at  2   77 
3277,Oh ok  Because we went back to poor
3278,headthickness  pistonborediameter  mass  factorofsafety
3279,We need to save weight
3280,whoever changed it change back
3281,assuming diameter is  40   is that true ? 
3282,As long as your factorofsafety is above  2   try to find the lowest possible mass
3283,whoever changed it change back
3284,omggg
3285,whyd we get bumped down
3286,whoever changed it change back
3287,whoever changed it change back
3288,yeah i have no clue
3289,ok my mass is   53  and factorofsafety is  1929 
3290,factorofsafety is too low now
3291,i havent changed
3292,thats good
3293,ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else
3294,I didn t change anything
3295,ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else
3296,Lower makes it worse
3297,Yes
3298,lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40 
3299,getting close
3300,ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else
3301,mine is at  2   03   dont think i can make changes  unless there is a better combination that requires changes from all of us
3302,pretty close now actually
3303,ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else
3304,lets try that
3305,why ? 
3306,sounds good
3307,what is your mass ? 
3308,alright yeah  I mass at lowest possible mass   0   1   and factorofsafety is  2   77 
3309,lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40   changing it to that
3310,cool we are good
3311,try to find a good combination at pistonborediameter equals to  40 
3312,my factorofsafety s  is  9193   31 
3313,its just flywheel that is rich apparently and can afford to experiment
3314,lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40   changing it to that
3315,it s good now
3316,only   7  away now
3317,what is your current mass and factorofsafety ? 
3318,try increasing your factorofsafety
3319,who went down in weight ? 
3320,yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by   01  so probably not me
3321, 3   91 factorofsafety  5   2 mass
3322,What parameter do you control ? 
3323,Ok
3324, 5   2 
3325,only   7  away from excellent
3326,Ok yeah thats not you
3327,Sorry  what is your current length
3328,what is your factorofsafety and mass ? 
3329,Does a smaller or larger flywheel thickness help you ? 
3330,what is your mass and factorofsafety ? 
3331,i have factorofsafety at  3   23 
3332,that will increase my mass  which is where we are too high
3333,I didn t change anything
3334,were at good lets leave it
3335,Lets not change it
3336,my mass is  3   13   the lowest option  and factorofsafety is  0   58 
3337,we re at good lets leave it
3338,thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length
3339,Do we want to end with very good ? 
3340,Okay
3341,Do we want to end with very good ? 
3342,Do we want to end with very good ? 
3343,we re at good lets leave it
3344,Do we want to end with very good ? 
3345,Lets not change it now
3346,Are you ending the experiment
3347,are we content with very good ? 
3348,are we content with very good ? 
3349,mass  equals to   0   12  with f at  3   44 
3350,yeah
3351,we re at good lets leave it
3352,are we content with very good ? 
3353,Lets not change it now
3354, 2   06 
3355,yeah i cant change anything  We done ? 
3356,are we content with very good ? 
3357,sure
3358,yeah i cant change anything  We done ? 
3359,Im fine with it
3360,thickness equals to  2   ratio equals to  3 
3361,yeah i cant change anything  We done ? 
3362,yeah i cant change anything  We done ? 
3363,Lets not change it now
3364,Same
3365,what is the highest factorofsafety you can get ? 
3366,Yeah I think that s the best we can get
3367, 1   75  and  6   07 
3368,ok ill leave then
3369,mass factorofsafety
3370,I mass fine with that
3371,yeah
3372,down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
3373,rip too late
3374,can you vut the mass by any chance ? 
3375,cut
3376,it s my best option
3377,We are good now
3378,ok ill leave it then
3379,my lowest factorofsafety is still  700   mass only goes down to   52  and its there
3380,mass  1   97  factorofsafety  3   05 
3381,Are you good with the results ? 
3382,I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
3383,flyweel is good too
3384,im good
3385,time is up it says on my system
3386,variable that affects my mass and factorofsafety is just diameter  so I ve been minimizing my  outputs  on that diameter
3387,am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
3388,do you think increase factorofsafety of lighter componet while decreasing factorofsafety of my part will work ? 
3389,Piston pin too
3390,if you can lower mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   try to
3391,agreed
3392,You good to leave
3393,so close
3394,I mass good too
3395,do you think increase factorofsafety of lighter componet while decreasing factorofsafety of my part will work ? 
3396,maybe we should just call it good
3397,I mass ending it
3398,can you cut the mass by any chance ? 
3399,alright
3400,i guess it s good
3401,good work
3402,good work
3403,good work
3404,good work
3405,were good
3406,good ? 
3407,good ? 
3408,good ? 
3409,Hello
3410,Hello
3411,Hello
3412,Hello
3413,Hi
3414,sup
3415,Hello
3416,Gott an idea for the piston bore diameter ? 
3417,hey whats the crank length ? 
3418,Got and idea for the flywheel thickness ? 
3419,let s get this bread
3420, 
3421,try  40  ? 
3422,Try  15 
3423,aight bet
3424,Well it s between  40  and  70  so maybe like  55  to start ?  I ll run some simulations
3425,sorry  225  first
3426,okay
3427,What is our piston Bore ? 
3428,my connecting rod length  equals to   1  crank length 
3429,so that seems too big
3430,Hello  what s the piston bore diameter ? 
3431,Hey  what factorofsafety  do you think would be good enough   1   5 - 2   25  ish ? 
3432,Hey  what are the updates you would have on the piston bore diameter if any
3433,hi
3434,waaaaait my bad
3435,Not sure yet 
3436,Not quite sure yet 
3437,any good values for the piston bore pistonborediameter ? 
3438,the equation of the ratio R 1   equals to   connector rod crank length 
3439,What inputs do you need for calculating the diameter  if any ? 
3440,so  225  could work
3441,Are you in charge of the variable bearingoffset ?  Is it more beneficial to maximize or minimize it ? 
3442,ill go with a ratio of  4  so  900  for connector length
3443,Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset ? 
3444,Yea  it s better to minimize bearingoffset
3445,Just broadcasted it  I set pistonborediameter at  55 
3446,Just broadcasted it  I chose  55  for pistonborediameter
3447,I have not been having a lot of luck  try something like  110 mm
3448,Just broadcasted it  looks like  55  for pistonborediameter was a good choice
3449,More than  2  is excellent
3450,can you change it to  150  ? 
3451,George ? 
3452,no ? 
3453,Hello  can you send me the flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness value greater than 
3454,It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same  but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but factorofsafety is reduced
3455,So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea
3456,sounds good
3457,what bore diameter are you thinking ? 
3458,What variables equations do you deal with ? 
3459,what I mass looking at is  60  and  12 
3460,What variables equations do you deal with ? 
3461,yuh
3462,what about now ? 
3463,Hey so what changes have you made so far to the piston design ? 
3464,so that makes it  600  for connector lenght
3465,go with  90  for now
3466,Hey  do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter ? 
3467,with a ratio of  4 
3468,lets try  90 
3469,Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? 
3470,Also I think a flywheelthickness value of  10  is best
3471,Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? 
3472,Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? 
3473,go with  90 
3474,Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? 
3475,ok
3476,has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? 
3477,ok
3478,has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? 
3479,has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? 
3480,bet
3481,has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? 
3482,Cause I ve been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
3483, 9   09 
3484,nah
3485,The piston pin length  and the inner and outer diameter of the of the piston pin
3486,same
3487, 5625   56 
3488, 0   57 
3489,the broadcast still shows  40 
3490,Nvm I can see them
3491,the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
3492,It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I mass doing something wrong
3493,Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety
3494,aight do you need any connector rod info ? 
3495,For the one I just ran I got  2   62 
3496,Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety
3497,Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety
3498,huh I would ask a TA then 
3499,aight did you broadcast anything ? 
3500,Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety
3501,Yo
3502,Yeah it keeps showing up as poor for me as well  Let me play with the piston some more  I was looking at the auto engine and didn t see how small our mass had to be
3503,the other values on our team are like between  2   5  and  5000 
3504, 45 
3505,that was with r 2  at   5   r 3  at  7  and pistonborediameter at  40 
3506,the values I have broadcasted should generate max factorofsafety
3507,i broadcasted the simulation for  12 mm for thickness and  60 mm for diameter
3508,i can also cut weight but it will reduce factorofsafety
3509,Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
3510,What info do you have ? 
3511,yeah we are less than  3  but the factorofsafety is still   59   yikes
3512,Quality very good Nice 
3513,Quality very good Nice 
3514,Gotcha
3515,Quality very good Nice 
3516,try  65 
3517,crankshaft bearing offset
3518,i made my connector rod to crank length ratio  4 
3519, 150 mm
3520,so connector rod is  600 
3521,Do you have a value for piston bore diameter ? 
3522,and thickness is  7   5 
3523,is that your ideal dim ? 
3524,Yes
3525,quality looks very good so idk ? 
3526,So  I can increase factorofsafety by alot but my part would weigh  so I could
3527,Smallest number possible is best
3528,I got factorofsafety  2  WITH  1   67  ms
3529,ill try to run simulation more to see if there is any other cases that has bigger f
3530,Will make it larger only if you need
3531,what is your pin diameter ? 
3532,It increases the mass a lot
3533,we need smaller mass
3534,we need smaller mass folks
3535,Right now I have it broadcasted at  55 
3536,we need less mass folks
3537,I made a design change to cut weight by   7  with similar factorofsafety
3538,I don t know if I can get a factorofsafety over  1  with that diameter
3539,we need less mass folks
3540,Global quality looking bad though
3541,alright  I can get  2   77  with that value for pistonborediameter  Do you plan on changing pistonborediameter ? 
3542, 150  is the lower bound 
3543,is this just a tolerance between the crankshaft bearing and flywheel ? 
3544,Can you broadcast a design with bearingoffset as  130  ? 
3545,we almost there
3546,i dont think i have that as an input  Unless im missing something 
3547,So I decreased weight  and kept same factorofsafety
3548,Thats great  any way you can reduce weight more then ? 
3549,negative
3550,not much  my factorofsafety will decrease dramatically for a drop in  0   03  mass
3551,What were the values ? 
3552,lets go back to  90  maybe ?  the quality dropped
3553,Oh okay  Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
3554,i can do  40  easy
3555,I mean factorofsafety only needs to be greater than  2 
3556,what  the crankshaft bearing offset ? 
3557,Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that
3558,Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that
3559,yeah
3560,We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable
3561,So good news  turns out the rod thickness increase from  6   5  mm to  7  mm increased the factorofsafety by  0   23  but only increased the weight by  0   13  kg
3562,Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that
3563,Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that
3564,i will see what i can do
3565,Perfect
3566,So far as I can tell  I just need to make sure that this number is smaller than your flywheel thickness
3567,rad
3568,what is the bore diameter ? 
3569,We need to increase factorofsafety somehow
3570,Any luck ? 
3571,Ok
3572,alright  let me find my ideal values based on the  40 
3573,hey  just wondering  what are your inputs ? 
3574,lowest I could do is  75  for the weight
3575,I agree  My part increases in weight linearly and increases in factorofsafety exponentially so its probably better to maximize it  Do you have a part that increases in factorofsafety only linearly ?  you can see it on the graphs
3576,What are your mass and factorofsafety values looking like now greater than 
3577,Cool
3578,switched to  43 
3579,we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the amss
3580,i have thickness of flywheel as  12 mm and  60 mm for shaft diameter
3581,Cause we re still really high on weight
3582,mass
3583,pistonborediameter isn t controlled by me
3584,  05  for mass
3585,i think you can see it in II  right ? 
3586,oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by  0   25 
3587, 2   03  for factorofsafety
3588,Ok with the minimum mass  for the flywheel  factorofsafety is still  1215 
3589,we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the mass
3590,Actually  that doesn t make any sense  since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is  150 mm  and your maximum flywheel thickness is  51 
3591,mm
3592,use  43 mm shaft diameter  The crankshaft engineer gave me that value recently
3593,factorofsafety is back i increased thickness
3594,im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety
3595,can get  2   62  factorofsafety with   01  extra mass
3596,ok
3597,make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
3598,make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
3599,make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
3600,make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
3601,did I ? 
3602,Yep
3603,Thats great
3604,yeah it can t be
3605,Yeah looking better
3606,Alright
3607,hows it going
3608,Yeah the mass looks like a problem
3609,Can you do that ?  Right now its at  50 
3610,No  i dont think so  I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter
3611,The mass is our biggest issue
3612,ms  equals to  6   72   factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 
3613,what flywheel factors affect the bearing offset ?  as in changing the flywheel thickness diameter ? 
3614,try going up by  1   try making it  41   42   43  
3615,It still says   51  and he said that was for the team and that I couldn t see my own  I don t know if that makes sense though ?  ? 
3616,for bearingoffset ? 
3617,how will those affect your value
3618,do you know if you can reduce mass ? 
3619,Yes
3620,Are you happy with your piston diameter ? 
3621,I can only do  60 - 130 
3622,or does it at all
3623,I am not sure
3624,what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 
3625,what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 
3626,i switched it back to  45 
3627,ill try cut a bit of weight with flywheeldiameter
3628,what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 
3629,Sorry  60 
3630,we have our factorofsafety up  just need to reduce the mass
3631,what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 
3632,That would increase mass  Do you mean go down ? 
3633,ms  equals to   6   72  ? 
3634,Yeah really
3635,When you broadcast  does that just update the overall model with the design you selected for your subsystem ? 
3636,i think i will reach my ideal values in a second
3637,Yes
3638, 0   52 
3639,awesome
3640,how do I broadcast ? 
3641,flywheelthickness value of  10 
3642,whats your lower limit ? 
3643,yeah  lowest i ve gotten with an factorofsafety greater than  2 
3644,factorofsafety  equals to   1215 
3645,how about you ? 
3646,hows it going ? 
3647,What does it change for you ? 
3648,Broadcast your latest values
3649,I mass gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
3650,Good point   40  is the lower limit
3651,it updates the global model
3652,now it says  2   03 
3653,minimum mass and about  2   03  factorofsafety
3654,increasing your the bearing offset only reduces the factorofsafety so im keeping it at  150 
3655,minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail
3656,Broadcast the latest values
3657,U mean  0   672  ? 
3658,idk what changed but quality just dropped
3659,After you run a simulation you can broadcast a simulaiton
3660,Broadcast the latest values
3661,sure
3662,Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness
3663,the simulation results for me show the subsystem factorofsafety
3664,yeah try that
3665,just did 
3666, 75  is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement
3667,no  i mean  6   72 
3668,still  45 
3669,but I can slightly increase mass to get  2   63  factorofsafety
3670,awesome
3671,but  2   03  is good enough  we just gotta fix te weight now
3672, Select a design to broadcast 
3673,that factorofsafety is good since your part is pretty small
3674,  06  and  2   62 
3675, 5   82 
3676,I think it should be up
3677, 0   1   2   77 
3678,any updates ? 
3679,check for broadcast ? 
3680,Do you have control over pistonborediameter ? 
3681,makes sense  I mass checking with the others to see who is using the most mass
3682,Okay  great
3683,Im using the minimum possible values and cant change much more
3684,I see it
3685,Kind of  increasing thickness increases factorofsafety
3686,uh  piston guy says pistonborediameter  equals to   40 
3687,In my simulation I increased Tf to  51   It brought the factorofsafety down ever so slightly  but brought down the mass by  2  kg for some reason
3688,Good
3689,Cool
3690,I think a flywheelthickness value of  10  is best
3691,hey what changes in mass have you noticed  if any  when you change the bearing support offset ? 
3692,have you reached an ideal value for your part yet ? 
3693,Do you have control over pistonborediameter ? 
3694,im trying to broadcast with bearingoffset equals to  130 
3695,is that your mass or factorofsafety value
3696,Anyway you can reduce mass slightly
3697,we desperately need to reduce weight
3698,Flywheel would be the heaviest part
3699,check out my latest broadcast  that looks like the best I can do
3700,we desperately need to reduce weight
3701,we desperately need to reduce weight
3702,we desperately need to reduce weight
3703,No I do not  I would consult the piston
3704,any way i can help in reducing hat weight
3705,Try broadcasting  80 
3706,what is your mass factorofsafety
3707,flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
3708,Sorry  I think my mass is  1   5 
3709,I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and factorofsafety
3710,fair  that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase factorofsafety  I ll decrease mass
3711,you can maximize the crank shaft bearing support offset if it benefits your design  it decreases my factorofsafety but my factorofsafety is so high that it doesnt matter much
3712,what is your mass factorofsafety
3713,I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on factorofsafety
3714,So we are in good range right now
3715,So we are in good range right now
3716,I mass just doing what he tells me tbh
3717,is it possible for that to go lower
3718,haha
3719,Yes  factorofsafety looking good
3720,if I increase the offset  mass increases
3721,yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight
3722,Yo
3723,Crap  I wish it would update automaticly
3724,talk to flywheel as that would be the heaviest bit ? 
3725,meant decrease thickness and lower the weight
3726,yo
3727,not anymore  do you have control over pistonborediameter ? 
3728,who are you
3729,seems like lower was working better
3730,yeah increasing pistonborediameter changes mass by an enormous amount  like change of five adds  5  to ms
3731,ok
3732,new bearingoffset is broadcast
3733,Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 
3734,I think so
3735,how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by  10  mm ? 
3736,my part minimized the mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   will keep updating it
3737,Preston
3738,Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 
3739,You ? 
3740,Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 
3741,Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 
3742,what can you do with your diameter
3743,same sounds good
3744,hot dog
3745,your part seems pretty light how large can you make the factorofsafety
3746,Also  does me increasing bearingoffset help you at all ? 
3747,Hey if I increase pistonborediameter  will that help or hurt your design
3748,Hey what do you have control over ? 
3749,that s big
3750,we re at good pull your weight
3751,factorofsafety just went down
3752,alriight
3753,ok
3754,aight
3755,about  12 
3756,factorofsafety just went down
3757,havent found a combination better than   06  and  2   62 
3758,what changed greater than 
3759,it is the lowest diameter i could do
3760,whats your weight at ? 
3761,are you still using pistonborediameter  equals to   40  ? 
3762,ok so id say you worry more about low mass with pistonborediameter and I can worry more about high factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter
3763,no keep it low
3764,it drops the factorofsafety
3765,and im kamran
3766,my part maintains factorofsafety equals to  2   06 
3767,If you can lower factorofsafety to closer to  2  we might be in business  I think we need to get below the mass limit
3768, 12  kg ?  damn
3769,minimize it if you can while keeping factorofsafety as close to  2  as possible
3770,Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass
3771,wait what did you change ? 
3772,thats great  im at  0   1   2   62 
3773,maybe lower if needed
3774,Um hold on 
3775,we can make some spare weight elsewhere
3776,i can decrase on the weight but the factorofsafety wouldn t meet requirement
3777,did you change anything ?  greater than 
3778,We need factorofsafety to be around  1   5 
3779,I didnt change anything
3780,I think the factorofsafety shown is the lowest factorofsafety of ours
3781,Well I think each individual part needs a factorofsafety greater than  2 
3782,But I can try that
3783,bearingoffset was changed to  80 
3784,seems to be maximized at  2   62  ill keep trying other values
3785,I control pistonborediameter somewhere in  90 
3786,ok
3787,yea
3788,But i dont control that
3789,your part seems to be using the most mass so I pistonborediameter say worry about that rather than factorofsafety and see if the others can bump it up
3790,so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit
3791,did you broadcast your value ? 
3792,what are your flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness ? 
3793,or just go get food cz i am hungry
3794,what is your factorofsafety and mass ? 
3795,alright
3796,Mine has an factorofsafety of  2   42 
3797,idk my factorofsafety at  2  and weight minimized
3798,Oh I ve got a different system factorofsafety  mine is about  2 
3799,did you get factorofsafety as  1   81  ? 
3800,undo what you did
3801,what is your mass currently ? 
3802,Piston bore diameter
3803,make sure to reduce weight and keep factorofsafety at  2 
3804,I mass happy with my numbers  but if you need to change something I will compensate
3805,What is your factorofsafety ? 
3806,was it pistonborediameter equals to  75  that was giving us that low weight ? 
3807,did you get factorofsafety as  1   81  ? 
3808, 0   52 
3809,im just trying to max factorofsafety but your piston wont affect my flywheel
3810,also piston guy is using pistonborediameter equals to  40 
3811,minimized
3812,im just telling you you need to start hustlin
3813,  06  and  2   63 
3814,mass is  1   7  and factorofsafety is  3   5 
3815,Oh ok mine just updated
3816,change what to what ?  
3817,we are so close
3818,Is  40  the best value you have found for pistonborediameter
3819,we are soooo close
3820,i dont know where to reduce the weight tho
3821,flywheelthickness is  10 
3822,flywheeldiameter is  20 
3823,okay I ll keep lowering it
3824,We got very good
3825,K  lowest I can make my weight with factorofsafety greater than  2  is  5   42  which is a big improvement
3826,ratio for piston pin length to piston diameter
3827,my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott
3828,hommie we need to decrease weight not increase factorofsafety  
3829,dont move
3830,bottom
3831,Yeah  the mass is huge otherwise
3832,what is your factorofsafety and mass ? 
3833,dont move
3834,i can t go lower than this
3835,dont move
3836,Does it kill the factorofsafety if you decrease the offset below  150  ? 
3837,dont move
3838,thats right
3839,Yeah still at  40  just made thickness smaller
3840,Ok
3841,perfect
3842,ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
3843,Not moving even a bit  :  
3844,seems to be helping
3845,yeap
3846,for my subsystem ? 
3847,yes
3848,I think a lower pistonborediameter is better  something like a  75  was giving us a good weight
3849,actually sorry i cant go below  150 
3850, 2   08 
3851,Sick  our engine is now excellent
3852,flywheel boi is tryna improve
3853, 2   08 
3854,if you lower pistonborediameter I can raise the factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter
3855,Ah I see
3856,Yep
3857,lets just try getting our mass down
3858,for subsytsem
3859,Yeah it is in good range
3860,lets just try getting our mass down
3861,lets just try getting our mass down
3862,lets just try getting our mass down
3863, 2   42 
3864,what did you just change ? 
3865,flywheelthickness of  10  is the best for mass
3866,is it each part or globally
3867,My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value
3868,so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your factorofsafety
3869,sounds good
3870,I ll try
3871,My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value
3872,I think the previous dimensions had us at a  very good 
3873,My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value
3874,My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value
3875,can you try  80  ? 
3876,or maybe  80 
3877,on my screen it says quality is excellent
3878,i willl try decreasing dc
3879,i didnt change
3880,Each part should be at  2 
3881,Does increasing bearingoffset increase the mass or decrease
3882,seems like the sim values factorofsafety over weight as far as getting from  fair  to  good 
3883,something changed we were closer
3884,something changed we were closer
3885,Gotcha  This is harder than if we had a group chat  
3886,something changed we were closer
3887,Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen
3888,no boy we need both
3889,yeah but that increase weight by   5  gram is that worth it for you
3890,any way you can reduce mass ? 
3891,Ok
3892,go back to  88 mm diameter i want to see what happens
3893,I think bearingoffset needs to be changed
3894,Can you reduce mass ? 
3895, ? 
3896,I mass at fair quality  factorofsafety is a bit low  total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though
3897,u mean  80  ? 
3898,if you get it lower than  2   0   you can try adding some mass  it s ok 
3899,factorofsafety is  1   92  and mass is  1   46 
3900,Who is the fly wheel designer  ? 
3901,the other parts weigh  0   1   0   06   0   52  and  0   99 
3902,Let me know when you are done changing pistonborediameter for a little while
3903,whats the max diamter
3904,Now Im at good  weights a bit high but factorofsafety is right on
3905,you can go
3906,oof
3907,Is one of your variables bore diameter ? 
3908, 105 
3909,mass is lowest it can be with factorofsafety larger than  2   I ll try more decimals
3910,go back to what we were at
3911,yes
3912,currently my mass is  0   53 
3913,I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down
3914,currently at  90 
3915,I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down
3916,now its  1   18 
3917,My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone
3918,but pistonborediameter has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve factorofsafety
3919,for mass
3920,ah  so when we broadcast we can overwrite
3921,As pistonborediameter gets lower  my ms gets way to high
3922,and keep pistonborediameter lower
3923,hmm
3924,not my pistonborediameter the piston s pistonborediameter
3925,what have you been in control of ? 
3926,My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone Send
3927,what are your input params besides the bore diam ? 
3928,it s at very good for me
3929,pistonborediameter and thickness t
3930,What did u choose for pistonborediameter ? 
3931,one sec
3932,piston thickness   2 - 7  mm
3933,mass is  0   52   factorofsafety is  2   01   and one of my values is minimized  not sure how much more I can optimize currently
3934,thats with both at their minimum so it can t get any lower for my part
3935,What did u choose for pistonborediameter ? 
3936,Weigght 
3937,That s what I mass altering
3938,now mass is  1   18 
3939,pistonborediameter  equals to  75 
3940,increasing bearingoffset increases mass
3941,mine says Very Good
3942,i havent broadccasted anything new
3943,If I do the lowest mass I can then factorofsafety goes down by a lot
3944,You have bore diameter too ? 
3945,hmm
3946,mass is  1   18  and thats with both as low as they can get
3947,we did hit both requirements at one point
3948,something happened to factorofsafety
3949,and factorofsafety ? 
3950,right now at  88  shows very good
3951,alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 
3952,I dont have control over it  I think its you and the piston  Seems to me like the low  80  range was working best though but Im not sure
3953,So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass 
3954,So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass 
3955,perfect
3956,doe increasing pistonborediameter give you better weight ? 
3957,So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass 
3958,So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass 
3959,heyyis there any way you could reduce the weight ? 
3960,what is your mass ? 
3961,yes
3962,sounds good
3963,are you broadcasting your latest values ?  and your factorofsafety is above  2  right ? 
3964,Same 
3965,heyy is there anyway you could reduce the weight slightly ? 
3966,Literally  there is not
3967,Ok I think right now we just need to decrease mass
3968,whats your value right now ? 
3969,alright  just get factorofsafety to right above  2  and that ll have to do
3970, 2   04   no bene
3971,I get higher weight if pistonborediameter decreases
3972,and factorofsafety ? 
3973,yeah
3974,flywheelthickness of  10  and flywheeldiameter of  15  is the lowest mass I can get
3975,alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 
3976,K  what is your weight ? 
3977,But factorofsafety is low
3978,Sure
3979,ah okk
3980,oh
3981,In pistonborediameter  equals to   75  ? 
3982,did u change pistonborediameter to  88  ? 
3983,keep trying iterations
3984,yeah
3985,how about increasing factorofsafety ? 
3986,that s what the piston guy is saying
3987,cZ i was gonna try  80 
3988, 1   92 
3989,lowest mass is best i think flywheel is the heavist thing
3990,i can still reduce the weight somewhat
3991,its  1   92 
3992,any changes ? 
3993,I just got my factorofsafety up to  9 
3994,ms was  2   79 
3995,and see what happens
3996,mass at  1   63   factorofsafety at  53   27 
3997,have you lowered mass as much as you can ? 
3998,But my mass is like  0   9 
3999,Okay  lowest ms i can get is like  5   42 
4000,keeping factorofsafety at  2 
4001,im going to try to change it to get factorofsafety higher and yeah I broadcasted
4002,yeah i optimized mine as much as ic an
4003,no i dont have control of it
4004,I just bumped mine up
4005,yeah
4006,does increasing pistonborediameter give you better or worse weight
4007,just above  2 
4008,yeah i have no idea how it got changed lol
4009,But that also bumped up my mass like  0   3 
4010,can you bring factorofsafety down ?  it only needs to be  2 
4011,yeah agreed  it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect  so im going to stick to maximizing factorofsafety
4012,also reducing bearingoffset significantly reduces the factorofsafety
4013,Hi Kamran
4014,Are you broadcasting those values ? 
4015,yes
4016,I mass trying to while considering what piston did
4017,are you broadcasting the values giving that weight ? 
4018,I think the other designers have way too high factorofsafety s
4019,Is it safe to say we are only tweaking flywheeldiameter and pistonborediameter at this point ?  I have partial control over flywheeldiameter  What do you have ? 
4020,could you try decreasing the piston bore ?  Based on my simulations it really helps with weight and doesn t significantly impact factorofsafety
4021,Is it safe to say we are only tweaking flywheeldiameter and pistonborediameter at this point ?  I have partial control over flywheeldiameter  What do you have ? 
4022,Is it safe to say we are only tweaking flywheeldiameter and pistonborediameter at this point ?  I have partial control over flywheeldiameter  What do you have ? 
4023,Is it safe to say we are only tweaking flywheeldiameter and pistonborediameter at this point ?  I have partial control over flywheeldiameter  What do you have ? 
4024,yep
4025,I have control over pistonborediameter
4026,increasing pistonborediameter gives me a worse weight
4027,I have conrod thickness and the ratio between conrod length and crank length
4028,i waaaaaant mooooney
4029,lets get this bread
4030,noooooooooooo
4031,NOOOOOO
4032,  2  missed
4033,I think the global factorofsafety is just the minimum value out of the  5  of us
4034,yes
4035,we have time
4036,i thought we are done ? 
4037,i have control over neither  only bearingoffset and dc
4038,i think he does the bore design
4039,im at  0   22  and  2   02 
4040,get you factor of safety as close to  2 
4041,mass as low as possible
4042,do you have your factorofsafety as close to  2 
4043,do you have your factorofsafety as close to  2  ? 
4044,Keep me updated on your piston bore diameter  It s something I ll need in my simulations
4045,Hey  I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
4046,pistonborediameter  equals to   90  for now
4047,Hey  I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
4048,Hello
4049,How is your factorofsafety related to my pin parameters ? 
4050,Hi  please keep me updated on the piston bore diameter
4051,use  15  for now as I try to find better values on my end
4052,How is your factorofsafety related to my pin parameters ? 
4053,How is your factorofsafety related to my pin parameters ? 
4054,How is your factorofsafety related to my pin parameters ? 
4055,Hi  what is the flywheel shaft diameter ? 
4056,Need anything from me ? 
4057,sorry  60 
4058,Need anything from me ? 
4059,Need anything from me ? 
4060,Hi  what have you decided for the piston bore diameter ? 
4061, 55 mm
4062,In the current broadcast  the value is  15 
4063,I don t think it is
4064,No  not that I know of
4065,thanks 
4066,mass  equals to   1   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   8  for that value
4067,Right now I mass using pistonborediameter  equals to   85 
4068,I will be changing the thickness and broadcast the value  It should affect the bearing support offset 
4069,yeah
4070,I mass going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it
4071,Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin ? 
4072,I ll check in with you on that in a sec
4073,Please let me know if you change the piston bore diameter
4074,If that s the same as the thickness of the connecting rod  then I mass currently at  2  mm
4075,That s subject to change though
4076,I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length  All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety
4077,what diameter have you chosen ? 
4078,what is the thickness you have on that right now with a pistonborediameter equals to  15  ? 
4079,Increasing that will allow my factor of safety to increase  Any reason we re keeping it low ? 
4080,I have to account for the piston diameter  higher values for that mean that I get a higher mass and factorofsafety
4081,got it 
4082,Thanks
4083,any preference on the piston bore diameter ? 
4084,Hey could I get the value of the piston bore diameter whenever you ve got it ? 
4085,Right now I have pistonborediameter equals to  85 
4086,What are your initial ideas for bearing offset ? 
4087,any preference on the piston bore diameter
4088,I don t select any diameter
4089,thickness  equals to   10 
4090,pistonborediameter  equals to   15 
4091,what s your current bore diameter
4092,my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter
4093,something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  
4094,something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  
4095,something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  
4096,Are you referring to the piston bore diameter ? 
4097,try bearing offset  equals to   180   crankshaft pin is  35  mm
4098,Between  45  and  50  would be wonderful 
4099,yes
4100,Thanks 
4101,That comes from the piston
4102,Right now its at  90 
4103,sounds good  ill do  45 
4104,sounds good ill do  45 
4105,Is higher or lower pistonborediameter better for you ? 
4106,Is higher or lower pistonborediameter better for you ? 
4107,Are they related ?  There is nothing in my design to indicate that they are
4108,where do you see  90 
4109,It looks to me like a smaller bearing offset gives both lower mass and higher factor of safety  so I mass thinking about keeping it smaller
4110,What does it look like for you ? 
4111,Maybe ?  My pin length is called l 1   el  1   and I also control the inner and outer diameter of the pin  pistonborediameter 0  and di 
4112,okay
4113,Do you need any information from me ? 
4114,Do you need any information from me ? 
4115,Gotcha  We ve got to get our factorofsafety up to  1   5  if we re gonna get out of the poor category
4116,piston told me
4117,higher pistonborediameter is better factorofsafety  and worse  higher  mass
4118,How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and factorofsafety ? 
4119,That s odd  I don t have either of those variables
4120,so you don t have flywheel shaft
4121,a higher pistonborediameter increases the mass and factorofsafety  With  85   my mass is  13   09  and factorofsafety is  7   69 
4122,Do you have an estimate to what diameter you want for the piston bore ? 
4123,diameter and flywheel thickness
4124,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
4125,I reduced the diameter to  40 mm to reduce the mass of the system
4126,hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod  my variables are l 1   length of the pin  and the inner and outer diameter of the pin  di  pistonborediameter 0  
4127,and 
4128,let me know what dims work for you and i can run simulations with them
4129,What s your current flywheel shaft diameter and thickness ? 
4130,Right now factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 
4131,flywheel would 
4132,okay  I ll try using that now
4133,mass  equals to   6   72 
4134,What piston bore diameter are you using ? 
4135,is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you ? 
4136, 85  right now
4137,is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you ? 
4138,is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you ? 
4139,Maybe not
4140,Okay  I ll play around with it
4141,I ve increased thickness to  5  mm
4142,I think my pin is what connects the crankshaft connecting rod to the piston
4143,The smaller offset works well for smaller flywheel dimensions but the factorofsafety is higher overall with larger dimensions
4144,what is your current factorofsafety ? 
4145,Smaller is good  I like  45 
4146,Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers
4147,Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers
4148,what have you chosen for diameter
4149,Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers
4150, 40  mm
4151, 40  would work as well if that helps
4152,larger has a better factorofsafety but the currently I used  45  and it s just high enough
4153,What are the the piston bore diameter are we making ? 
4154,It doesn t as far as I know  but the length of the crankshaft does  What is your current value for r ? 
4155,actually keep  45  for crankshaft
4156,I ll try it
4157,okay sounds good
4158,right now i have a thickness of  12  and diameter of  60 
4159,smaller gives me a much better factorofsafety
4160,okay  I think the value is not this 
4161,nvm
4162,My current factorofsafety is  7   69   what is yours ? 
4163,what about you ? 
4164,i got it from crankshaft
4165,okay  you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger
4166,Ok 
4167, 1   35   I wonder who has  0   61 
4168,Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers
4169,does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you ? 
4170,smaller is better for me as well
4171,bc thats the lowest and system level factorofsafety
4172,Keeping it  45  
4173, 40  mm
4174,let shoot for smaller then
4175, 60 mm
4176,Don t forget to broadcast your most promising results
4177,I mass using a crank pin diameter of  15  at the moment  in case you needed that value
4178,Don t forget to broadcast your most promising results
4179,Don t forget to broadcast your most promising results
4180,Okay  then you can do what you need to increase the factorofsafety  then let me know the new pistonborediameter
4181,we can see how good his her part is with  45  and increase if necessary
4182,my current factorofsafety is  1   35   connecting rod designedr has  7   69   what do you have ? 
4183,my current factorofsafety is  1   35   connecting rod designedr has  7   69   what do you have ? 
4184, 2 
4185,my current factorofsafety is  1   35   conrod has  7   69   what do you have ? 
4186,we should figure out who s factorofsafety is  0   44 
4187,and thickness
4188, 2   01 
4189,No i don t think so
4190,what values are you using for the flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel
4191,fair
4192,piston has  2   01 
4193,What s r ?  I think they gave us different variable names
4194,is your factorofsafety  0   44  ? 
4195,what is your offset right now
4196,you good if we start with a smaller bore diameter of  45  ?  if that doesn t work we can increase it
4197, 12  for thickness
4198,what is your current factorofsafety ? 
4199,It just updated to  3   2   but yea  Is there any parameter you need from me ? 
4200,what is your current factorofsafety ? 
4201, 2  is the max factorofsafety that we neeed
4202,Mine is  3   96 
4203,its up to  1   7  now so getting there
4204,What can you change that increases your factorofsafety ? 
4205, 45  is what I mass currently using  it s acceptable rn
4206, 2   16 
4207,lower increases my mass and factorofsafety
4208,ok
4209, 150  mm
4210,I don t think so  maybe try to find an factorofsafety closer to  2  and reduce the mass ? 
4211,use thickness  10  and diameter  25  for now
4212,anyway to reduce mass while keeping factorofsafety above  2  ? 
4213,kool
4214,Looks like moving from  90  up to  105  doesn t benefit me much in terms of the factorofsafety mass ratio
4215,nope my factorofsafety is  5625 
4216,So we can keep it low
4217, 75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters
4218,so it looks like our mass is killing us now
4219,The length of the crankshaft
4220,Do you need anything from me ? 
4221, 5625 
4222,Do you need anything from me ? 
4223, 75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters
4224,No  do you need anything from me ? 
4225,Oh I see  yea I ll work on that now
4226,length of pin  diameter of piston  higher is better 
4227,Do you need anything from me ? 
4228,mostly in flywheel design  I mass updating my values to see how those work
4229,piston mass is currently  0   83 
4230,okay
4231,how much mass is your part ? 
4232,great  thanks 
4233,Currently I mass at  7   69 
4234,What s your sub-system mass now ? 
4235,dang
4236,how much mass is your part ? 
4237, 5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters
4238,im at  0   06 
4239,can you reduce mass but keep factorofsafety above  2  ? 
4240,how much mass is your part ? 
4241, 1   62  currently
4242,I mass using  85  so my mass now is  6   72 
4243,okay thats nothing
4244,nope
4245,I don t think so
4246,piston mass is currently  0   83 
4247,piston mass is currently  0   83 
4248,is piston bore diameter  90 
4249,what s your factorofsafety
4250, ? 
4251, 2 
4252,I mass going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass  we re not doing too bad with factorofsafety
4253,I mass going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass  we re not doing too bad with factorofsafety
4254,what is your mass ? 
4255,I can  my lowest mass with the  45  bore diameter is  0   11   factorofsafety for that is  2   95 
4256, 0   55 
4257,Hello  Do you need any parameters from me ? 
4258,because my part weighs so little  ill just focus on the factorofsafety
4259,okay that seems good
4260, 0   55 
4261,Right  so I just used  75  and I my factorofsafety is still about  2 
4262,its  3   24 
4263,Hello  I do not
4264,most of mass is in piston and flywheel
4265,These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different pistonborediameter :   75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters
4266,Hello  What parameters do you need from me
4267,Hello  What parameters do you need from me
4268,What is your factorofsafety ?  
4269,I don t have control over that  I believe that s the piston 
4270,I am trying to change the piston thickness to reduce mass too
4271,whats your mass ? 
4272,yeah sounds good
4273,what is your bearing offset  ? 
4274,How does changing pistonborediameter affect your factorofsafety ? 
4275,broadcasting
4276,crankshaft weighs the most i think
4277, 1   93  right now
4278,yeah
4279,my new factorofsafety is  3   24   did that affect yours at all ? 
4280,oh wait  it might be the connecting rod
4281,okay thats the most mass by far
4282, 0   11 
4283, 60 
4284,Noted
4285,connecting rod said their mass is  0   11 
4286,Ok that doesn t affect mine
4287,my subsystem factorofsafety is reporting in the thousands  ? 
4288,Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 
4289,Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 
4290,crankshaft is  1   93 
4291,piston is  0   83 
4292,Let me know if you change the bearing offset
4293,awesome  thanks
4294,maybe just the mass  the broadcast has a very large mass
4295,I ll try to bring it down
4296,They didn t give me that one  I just have crankshaft bearing offset  crankshaft-pin diameter to change
4297,sounds good
4298,Hi I dont think I need parameters from you 
4299,what s your mass  ? 
4300,Try to lower it to  2 
4301,my mass is  0   52 
4302,any way to reduce the flywheel diameter ?  my mass is currently  1   93  but would reduce to  1   56  if diameter changed to  20 
4303,Do you need any parameters from me  ? 
4304,my objective is to maximize it
4305,Sounds good
4306,Do you need any parameters from me  ? 
4307,There is no benefit for a factorofsafety over  2 
4308,okay  my mass doesn t change that much so i can change to  20 
4309,my factorofsafety is  2   01 
4310,Try for a factorofsafety of  2  with minimum mass
4311,my factorofsafety is  2   01 
4312,my factorofsafety is  2   01 
4313,my factorofsafety is  2   01 
4314,great
4315,bearingoffset does not affect the mass  However  as you increase bearingoffset the factor of safety decreases
4316,mine is currently  2   16  so I ll cut that a little closer
4317,Not from what I understand
4318,is diameter  90 
4319,Mine s still  2   95 
4320,Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? 
4321,okay nice
4322,yes
4323,Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? 
4324,mine is  1   48 
4325,Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? 
4326,Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? 
4327,okay we might need to increase your
4328,Does a piston diameter of  85  work well for you ? 
4329,factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 
4330,but I think we re struggling with factorofsafety now
4331,It seems like larger pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety
4332,can you reduce is closer to  2  while decreasing mass ? 
4333,Yes
4334,Does a piston diameter of  85  work well for you ? 
4335,we only need it to be above  2 
4336,Does a piston diameter of  85  work well for you ? 
4337,factorofsafety coz that s minimum
4338,Does a piston diameter of  85  work well for you ? 
4339,what s the diameter you re using ? 
4340,Oh  wow  My factorofsafety is in the  20 s  so I can definitely scale back
4341,Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 
4342,Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 
4343,Smaller diameter is better for me
4344,yes
4345,is the factorofsafety a sum of our factorofsafety  ? 
4346,any way to make your part smaller ?  i think your part weighs the most 
4347,My current factorofsafety is also  1   35 
4348,What s your factorofsafety right now ? 
4349,im using a  40 
4350,Try and decrease bearingoffset so that we increase the factor of safety
4351,No  I mass at  3   23   Trying to drop that a bit and lower my mass  I mass at  2   11  for mass 
4352,btw our mass is still big  the piston pin only contribute roughly only  0   1  kg of mass
4353,dont we just need above  2  though ? 
4354, 2   95  is my minimum  I can t go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
4355,what s your factorofsafety ? 
4356,the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team
4357,yeah working on it now
4358,Currently  2   95 
4359,Get that up  That s the reason our overall is  1 
4360,What are your mass and factorofsafety ? 
4361,cool  let us know if we should change the bore diameter
4362,cant decrease it anymore  its at  40 
4363,oh true
4364,What are your mass and factorofsafety ? 
4365,I ll be on it
4366,I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me
4367,I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me
4368,I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me
4369,I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me
4370,Do what you need to do to get factorofsafety  greater than   1   5  and then we can adjust masses from there
4371,its already over  2 
4372,Oh I did not receive that update  I ll try my numbers at  40 
4373,k
4374,but we can try to imporve
4375,Nope  mass  equals to   1   27   factorofsafety _ s equals to  13238 
4376,with the absolute minimum dimensions my mass is  1   12  and factorofsafety is  4706   97 
4377,we are on good rn
4378,sure  I mass trying to play with bearingoffset to get a higher factorofsafety
4379,Re-running with new numbers  give me one second
4380,we need mass to be less than  3 
4381,Oh wait we just need to minimize the mass
4382,okay sounds good
4383,in the table with the simulations is what we get from our own parts
4384,is your factorofsafety still  5000  ish ? 
4385,Okay
4386,What testbed variables do you have ? 
4387,What testbed variables do you have ? 
4388,with my current dimensions mass is  1   2  and factorofsafety is  15886   04 
4389,can you get it above  2  ?  
4390,What testbed variables do you have ? 
4391,mass  equals to   1   27   factorofsafety _ s equals to  13238 
4392,What testbed variables do you have ? 
4393,Our factor of safety is greater than  2   which is excellent
4394,I pistonborediameter minimzie mass
4395,ill try
4396,so i dont think that i can change that much
4397,Wait   13000  for factorofsafety ? 
4398,Currently  3   2 
4399, 21   6     97   still working
4400,Your factorofsafety is huge
4401,aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize the mass and have a shot at the  very good
4402,Are you broadcasting it ? 
4403,excellent is above  2  but with mass lower than  2 
4404,Yes  with that my factorofsafety is now  2   17 
4405,are you still using A pistonborediameter equals to  40  ? 
4406,Diameter and thickness
4407,so even with  2   01  factorofsafety we can get excellent
4408,Just did
4409,its  2700 
4410,I mass at  2   77  now  all my numbers are at their minimum
4411,Yeah  I mass trying to figure that out  it seems really large
4412,okay nice
4413,what s your factor of safety currently
4414,THis is tru  communicate with crankshaft  He s our weakest link factorofsafety wise at the moment
4415,REFRESH IT  ITS LOWER THAN  2  RIGHT NOW
4416,Are you broadcasting
4417,Yes  that s the minimum diameter I can use
4418,What is your factorofsafety ? 
4419,sorry left my caps on
4420,flywheel thickness and diameter
4421,yeah
4422,I mass now at  2   77   all my numbers are at their minimum
4423,Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness  piston bore diameter
4424,great  thanks 
4425,Are you broadcasting that ? 
4426,Only the loest matters  so there s no need for anything above  2 
4427,hahaha
4428,Mass is now  0   1 
4429,Okay try and change bearingoffset
4430,What s your mass ? 
4431,What s your mass ? 
4432,Mass is now  0   1 
4433,I can adjust thickness to have a required factorofsafety at a specific pistonborediameter
4434,I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length
4435, 1   2 
4436, 3   2   but that s about to decrease since my mass is way too high
4437,hmm i reverted to previous dimensions
4438,Can you set the piston bore diameter to  85  and get a good factorofsafety ? 
4439,we just need our factorofsafety to be more than  2   ? 
4440,Aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize mass and have a shot at the  very good  or  excellent  marks  is there anything you need from me ? 
4441, 2880 
4442, 6   72 
4443,we need factorofsafety up a bit more now overall
4444,Ok  I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
4445,Yeah  factorofsafety hasn t been an issue for me  it s just mass is way too high
4446,is your factorofsafety still  2   01   ? 
4447,Ok  seems like  85  is good for pistonborediameter then
4448,or is it each case by case for each part  ? 
4449,That s alright  as long as we have a factorofsafety above  2 
4450,I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
4451,Only the lowest matters  so there s no need for anything above  2 
4452,what s your factorofsafety  ? 
4453,it is yeah
4454,whats your factorofsafety  ? 
4455, 2   01 
4456,not sure whose is  1   79 
4457,i have  1   7  factorofsafety with  58  mass
4458, 2   77 
4459,do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? 
4460,whats your factorofsafety  ? 
4461,For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? 
4462,It s just updated  now mass is  3   11  and factorofsafety is  2   07 
4463,is your factorofsafety  1   79  ? 
4464,whats the pistonborediameter and t values you
4465,For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? 
4466,What is your factorofsafety ? 
4467,Right  Got mine to mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
4468,For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? 
4469,hmm  anything I can do to help reduce your mass ? 
4470,awesome
4471,re using now ? 
4472,do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? 
4473,and yes I mass broadcasting that
4474,Have you changed your values any ? 
4475,its piston pin designer
4476,Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the factorofsafety just above  2  ? 
4477,do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? 
4478,Aim for factorofsafety to be above  2  while minimizing mass
4479,t  equals to   10 
4480,pistonborediameter  equals to   18 
4481,yes  as high as we can get factorofsafety the better
4482, 1   7  with bearing offset of  300 
4483,for pistonborediameter  equals to   75   mass  equals to   3   11 
4484,Good point  I could reduce my mass by   15  and the part will still be plenty strong
4485,what do they need to increase it ? 
4486,and one sec for the other one
4487,Are you broadcasting ? 
4488,even in the case by case basis  the higher the factorofsafety the better
4489,i can decrease diameter
4490,i talked to the TA and the factorofsafety of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing  In other words  that number doesn t relate to a single person t part apparently
4491,okay 
4492,Do it  Make mass as small as possible while still sitting above  2  
4493, person s
4494,not yet  might change to thickness  12  diameter  40  because my factorofsafety is huge
4495,minimum is  15  and i am at  20 
4496,We have some wiggle room in our mass now  I can try adjusting my thicknesses and see if that helps
4497,How does flywheel shaft diameter and thickness affect your mass ? 
4498,yes  an old version  I mass running the simulations you requested noe
4499,mass is currently  1   53  and factorofsafety  2   01 
4500,try and use  60  for bearingoffset
4501,We ve got a Good factorofsafety now  just need to get mass down
4502,What are your values ? 
4503, 1   48   my mass is so small im just trying to increase my factorofsafety
4504,What s your mass rn ? 
4505,okay
4506,ok let me see how that effects my design
4507,Do you have any dependencies with others measurements that could help your values ? 
4508,We ve got far too much mass at the moment overall
4509,okay
4510,What s your mass rn ? 
4511,I had factorofsafety  1   35  and mass equals to  0   93  in that run
4512,What s your mass rn ? 
4513,I did  earlier
4514,for pistonborediameter  equals to   85   min mass is  3   4 
4515,for me to have high factorofsafety i have to have high numbers
4516, 1   12 
4517,I ll try again with new parameters
4518,What is your current factorofsafety ? 
4519,oh okay
4520,might need to change something else
4521,mass  equals to   4   factorofsafety  equals to   2   4 
4522,difference of about  0   1 
4523,You re pretty solid
4524,if we can do that it cuts my mass to  1   24 
4525,what s your mass
4526,so really not much
4527,a mass of  58  for one component automatically puts us in the poor mark
4528,K  I mass at  4 
4529, 58 
4530,Is there any way you can reduce pistonborediameter ? 
4531,Check the top of the second page of the handout
4532,we need to cut down on mass
4533,Yeah  I mass leaving mine as is for now  Trying to figure out why our total mass is so high 
4534,It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now  in terms of mass and factorofsafety
4535,I think it s all coming from crankshaft  He doesnt seem to know whats going on
4536,I think it s all coming from crankshaft  He doesnt seem to know whats going on
4537,under performance requirements
4538,What is your mass ? 
4539,Yup 
4540, 7   4 
4541,mass  1   24 
4542,For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  my minimum factorofsafety is  2   85 
4543,its huge its  15886 
4544,Let me know if changing my pistonborediameter value could help improve the factorofsafety or mass
4545,We re good
4546,how did the mass increase by this much
4547,Let me know if changing my pistonborediameter value could help improve the factorofsafety or mass
4548,What is your factorofsafety and mass at currently ? 
4549,and factorofsafety ? 
4550,Let me know if changing my pistonborediameter value could help improve the factorofsafety or mass
4551,We re good 
4552, 2   01  still
4553,We ve gotta get crankshaft down  He s like all of our mass atm
4554,What other parameters do you have ?  Other than bearingoffset
4555,We re good
4556,no clue
4557,What is your factorofsafety and mass at currently ? 
4558,Ok  and your mass is pretty small  so it isn t a big deal  Mine is currently  27   44   so I mass trying to reduce it
4559,we are in excellent rn
4560,We re good
4561,okay sweet
4562,yes   75  works for me and piston
4563,what s your factorofsafety ? 
4564,Don t change anything
4565,Are your values finalized ?  I see we are at excellent now 
4566,Don t change anything
4567,The mass increased a lot
4568,Hi  what the values you are using ? 
4569,Are your values finalized ?  I see we are at excellent now 
4570,Don t change anything
4571,Are your values finalized ?  I see we are at excellent now 
4572,Don t change anything
4573,do you know why ? 
4574,We re done
4575,We re done
4576,we are tryin to cut down on mass right now
4577,We re done
4578,now its  1   67 
4579,yeet
4580,We re done
4581,We only need above  2   so try as must as you can to lower the mass
4582,i did it
4583,I adjusted my numbers  mass is now  0   16  factorofsafety is  4   66 
4584,factorofsafety  equals to   2   mass  equals to   6   72 
4585,The mass increased alot do you know why
4586,right now we need to focus on mass
4587,Ok looks like we re good
4588,actually
4589,sounds good
4590,but piston pin designer has lopw factorofsafety
4591,Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT
4592,what do you need to increase it ? 
4593,Don t change anything
4594,both  becaus factorofsafety is pretty low too
4595,Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT
4596,I am done
4597,Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT
4598,Don t change anything
4599,Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT
4600,it does increase my factorofsafety
4601,Great
4602,Yep  values finalized
4603,piston-pin s factorofsafety is lowest i beliver
4604,looks like we re good
4605,Does it look to you like we re meeting the global requirements now ? 
4606,looks like we re good
4607,that s at my minimum dimensions  I can t
4608,sounds good
4609,What is your factorofsafety right now ? 
4610,if you increase the diameter
4611,bearing is  150   pin is  50  mm
4612,Sweet 
4613,bearingoffset and dc
4614,my mass is  1   27  already
4615,Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good
4616,Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good
4617,Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good
4618,Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good
4619,what s your current factorofsafety
4620,did you try playing around with bearing offset  ? 
4621,Did your values just change ? 
4622,it says very good
4623,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4624,Wait  did you just change a value ? 
4625,mine is  29 
4626,how does dc affect mass and factor of safety
4627,i am using  60  rn
4628,I mass trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass
4629,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4630,Yea  nvm we re good i think
4631,i think i changed it to excellent
4632,No
4633, 2   01 
4634, 1215 
4635,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4636,but im strugling with mass
4637,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4638,same as crankshaft
4639,Yeah  I saw that  Wondering if it s the crankshaft
4640,its  1   52  with that
4641,Did you change your broadcast ? 
4642,i changed to excellent
4643,Ok
4644,are you still updating mass ?  we were in excellent
4645,we are good on mass  Now we need to work on safety factor
4646,Did you change your broadcast ? 
4647,I haven t it increases mass and decreases factorofsafety so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn t make sense on my end
4648,are you still updating mass ?  we were in excellent
4649,We re a little above the mass but otherwise good
4650,okay
4651,You could reduce the factorofsafety value since they are looking for the component with the smallest factorofsafety value
4652,I can give a factorofsafety equals to  6  with mass  equals to   0   4 
4653,Our mass is too high again
4654, 1   67 
4655,i changed the mass from  50  to  30 
4656, 1   67 
4657,Yes  that works
4658,pretty sure its someone else
4659,yeah
4660,I don t actually
4661,Yeah for a second we were meeting both I wonder what just updated ? 
4662,I changed something but it didn t affect my mass at all
4663,what s your factorofsafety  ? 
4664, 1   67 
4665,maybe  I ll try to go back
4666,Nope things changed to the worst now
4667,hmm okay
4668,Not sure where the mass increase came from
4669,my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step
4670,what inputs do you control ? 
4671,my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step
4672,I broadcasted that
4673,my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step
4674,my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step
4675,at a bore diameter of  45  i don t think there s anything I can do  I mass going to play around with bore diameter to see if that helps
4676,how do they affect the mass and safety factor
4677,What are your design variables currently ? 
4678,okay sounds goof
4679,What are your design variables currently ? 
4680,we still need to reduce mass by a lot
4681,No mines the same
4682,For pistonborediameter  equals to  85   what was your mass
4683,but our system factorofsafety is  1   25 
4684,What are your design variables currently ? 
4685,what s your factorofsafety  ? 
4686,What are your design variables currently ? 
4687,and increase factorofsafety a decent amount
4688, 2   01 
4689,pistonborediameter  equals to   85   mass  equals to   6   72 
4690,thickness  12  diameter  60 
4691,t  equals to   5   7   r 1   equals to   4 
4692,Mine is at  2   05 
4693,and pistonborediameter  equals to   85 
4694,whats your current factorofsafety
4695,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4696,try bore diamter of  40 
4697, 2   01 
4698,Yeah  my factorofsafety is minimized as well
4699,and i have an offset of  150  so if that changed let me know
4700,okay  I mass going to try and change bearingoffset
4701,piston-pin has the lowest I believe   1   67 
4702,We need just a hair less mass
4703, 2   77 
4704,I control the diameter of the piston head and the thickness of the piston head
4705,will do
4706,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4707,Changing pistonborediameter from  40  to  70  lowers the factorofsafety drastically like    3   0  but lowers the mass just a bit like    0   1 kg
4708,We need just a hair less mass
4709,Yeah that s what I ve found too
4710, 4706   67   I ve reduced my mass as far as possible
4711,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4712,I mass at  2   77 
4713,bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  45 
4714,KK
4715,pistonborediameter  equals to   75   r 2  equals to  0   89   r 3  equals to  0   8 
4716,We need just a hair less mass
4717,so i got an factorofsafety of  3   39  and mass of  0   11 
4718,whats your factorofsafety  ? 
4719,I broadcasted something but then i changed it now
4720,factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 
4721,The greater the values for either of those  the greater the factorofsafety and mass
4722,So I think for  40  mm is good for now
4723,at bore diameter of  40 
4724,Our factorofsafety just went down to  0   96   Is yours still good ? 
4725, 2   01 
4726,what is your factorofsafety ?  can you reduce your mass at all while staying above factorofsafety equals to  2   1 
4727,is there any way you can reduce mass   factorofsafety and still remain above  2   0  ? 
4728,okay
4729,Yes
4730,Mine s  2   03   Don t think I can get that lower
4731,our quality just went way down  did you change anything ? 
4732,okay thats better
4733,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4734,whats your current factorofsafety  ? 
4735,Can your mass be reduced at all ? 
4736,SAme
4737,No
4738,whats your current factorofsafety  ? 
4739,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4740,whats your current factorofsafety  ? 
4741,What are you broadcasting ? 
4742,we need to get below  3  kg for the factorofsafety to really matter at this point
4743,broadcasting  2   85  with a mass of  1   36 
4744,Go back to your last brasodcast values  You just fucked the factorofsafety
4745,Did you change anything ?  factorofsafety just tanked
4746,Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   44 
4747,yes i changed my numbers
4748,What are you broadcasting ?  
4749,pistonborediameter equals to  75   mass  equals to   1   36   factorofsafety  equals to   2   85 
4750,our quality just went way down  so if you changed anything try to change it back
4751,true  what s your mass ? 
4752,What s your factorofsafety ? 
4753,what s your factorofsafety ? 
4754,what is your factorofsafety now ? 
4755,What did you guys get
4756,shoot something changed
4757,Can you do pistonborediameter  equals to  85  ? 
4758, 2   77  is my minimum mass and factorofsafety I mass afraid
4759,no mine is  2   0 
4760,working on it
4761,i dropped  1  kg with  3  factorofsafety
4762,Get your factorofsafety just above  2  with as little mass as possible
4763,I mass at  1   01  for mass if factorofsafety  equals to   2   03   I don t think that can get better unless a shared dimension changes
4764,do we have a pistonpin  ?  because no one is answering me
4765, 0   52 
4766,I need to change pistonborediameter to  85  though
4767,yeah I saw that  I haven t changed anything
4768,ok
4769,which part of the piston are you handling ? 
4770,factorofsafety 
4771, ? 
4772,Wait are we using pistonborediameter  equals to   85  or  75  ? 
4773,Who is the   96  factorofsafety ? 
4774,My piston mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   01 
4775,it was  2   79  then made a couple changes and now it  1   25 
4776,are you changing anything  ? 
4777,I didn t change anything  still at bearingoffset equals to  150  and dc equals to  45 
4778,We do
4779,what s yours ? 
4780,do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight ? 
4781,is your fs still  2   1  ? 
4782,Must be crankshaft
4783, 85  right now  I was trying to optimize mass
4784,bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  45 
4785,mine is  1215 
4786, 2 
4787,We need to get the factorofsafety higher even if it means the mass is greater than  35 
4788,mass factorofsafety ? 
4789,I think the rest of us are right around  2   0 
4790,Okay good  I mass at  85  too
4791,are you making any changes  ? 
4792,mass  27   44 
4793,we need it to be higher than  2 
4794,are you making any changes  ? 
4795,factorofsafety  2   06 
4796, 1   25  ? 
4797,The piston bore diameter could be larger and my weight would still be ok  I mass at  0   1 
4798,mass  1   24    factorofsafety  2   01   but if bore diameter was reduced to  40  it could be mass equals to   1   15  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   79 
4799,How about we don t change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
4800,so let do the best design at  45 
4801,What s going on  bud ? 
4802,Can you change back to what you had before  The factorofsafety needs to increase 
4803,my best was  1   67  at a bore diameter of  45 
4804,Change it back to a run with a factorofsafety greater than  2 
4805,Like now
4806,no
4807, 10  bucks aint bad
4808,nothing much i could change at  45 
4809,try increasing factorofsafety
4810,wont let me
4811,it s not me im good
4812,was your factorofsafety less than  1  now
4813,wasnt me

4883, 75 
4884,Hi
4885,I can set the piston bore diameter at either  40    47   5    55    62   5   and  70 
4886,Whichever works best for you
4887,Piston diameter and piston head thickness

4891,Ahh nice
4892,from flywheel :  flywheeldesign variables :  Flywheel thickness Flywheel shaft dia flywheelneed :  crankshaft bearing offset
4893,hiyo
4894,idk what im doing at the moment
4895,looks like we both need bore diameter from piston
4896,lets do  62   5 
4897,sweet
4898,same
4899,what do you control and what do you need
4900,i broadcasted my best
4901,woof woof
4902,woof woof
4903,Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all ? 
4904,ok
4905,I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
4906,hey  im seeing the Crankshaft bearing support offset to be  60   0 mm  is this what you got
4907,If you decrease you piston diameter does it decrease mass and factorofsafety ? 
4908,Ok I also broadcast my best  it gives good weight and fs
4909,let me check
4910,piston diameter is  75   thickness is  10   5 
4911,do you have offset value ? 
4912,hey  Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be  10  mm  is this what you got ? 
4913,ok  increasing the diameter will decrease my mass and my factory of safety
4914,Increasing bearingoffset only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start  Do you need it bigger greater than 
4915,and the Flywheel shaft diameter to be  15 
4916, ? 
4917,Yes that is what I have input
4918,sweet
4919,decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety
4920,increase  sorry
4921,Currently I have the lowest piston diameter selected  but in general yes lower diameter means lower mass and factorofsafety
4922,the bearing support offset ? 
4923,so you dont need anything fom me right ? 
4924,yea
4925,bearingoffset bc yes
4926,bearingoffset
4927,do you know what s going on ? 
4928,ok yeye
4929,I don t understand
4930,we could try to go lower  Im still trying to figure out how this works haha
4931,I see that bearingoffset should be  60  is that what you have ? 
4932,do you know what s going on ? 
4933,my variables depend on piston bore diameter
4934,so raising bearingoffset increases mass and reduces factorofsafety
4935,do you know what s going on ? 
4936,which you control
4937,no idea
4938,So we need to get min mass and max factorofsafety
4939,you have o maximise bearingoffset right ? 
4940,if you increase the diameter  the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease
4941,Yeah thats what I got
4942,decrease mass
4943,decrease mass
4944,but we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
4945,decrease mass
4946,I get better factorofsafety but worse mass when i maximize bearingoffset  so it problably needs to be in the middle
4947,decrease mass
4948,I also have a second parameter that increases factorofsafety and mass if I increase that
4949,i think so  I think i just figured out what i need to do  I was confused at first
4950,Ok  Our factorofsafety isn t too bad right now so that s probably a good place to be at the moment
4951,same  60  is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now
4952,Ok do you have a set variable ?  In your chart
4953,i dont think so
4954, ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone
4955, ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone
4956, ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone
4957, ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone
4958,ahh gotcha
4959,it just became  0   13  though
4960,So we need to get min mass and max factorofsafety flywheelbut we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
4961,do you need r 2  or r 3  ? 
4962,group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? 
4963,what i was told
4964,group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? 
4965,group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? 
4966,So you want me to increase diameter ? 
4967,group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? 
4968,yea and increase factorofsafety
4969,ok
4970,I am a little confused  I though I knew what I was doing  but when I hit broadcast my numbers for the subsystem changed 
4971,oh yeah but this communication system is a struggle
4972,Yes
4973,Di the numbers change for you ? 
4974,that s cool
4975,Did
4976,What do you need from me ? 
4977,ok
4978,thought
4979,My best values on both charts have bearingoffset equals to  60  in common
4980,yo uright
4981,Yeah I just saw that  and our weight is massive
4982,okay
4983,Do your variables depend on piston bore diameter and piston head thickness ? 
4984,Do you need flywheel s thickness ? 
4985,can you go to the minimum bore diameter real quick
4986,how does diameter affect your part ? 
4987,I think its cause when anyone else changes their numberss it effects the other numbers
4988, I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety 
4989,retweet
4990, I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety 
4991, I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety 
4992,The flywheel shaft diameter was just changed to  17   5 
4993,yes and I am also playing with my numbers because I just realized now what to do  I am still getting poor quality though
4994, I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety 
4995,what s the projected mass and factorofsafety for your chosen part ? 
4996,Yes
4997,yes  one minute on that
4998,Made diameter  75 
4999,mine is mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84 
5000,Yeah I mass not exactly sure either  We need to get the total factorofsafety over  2   and total mass under  3   Not quite sure on how all the parts interact
5001,so for flywheel reasonable mass and best factorofsafety is giving thickness of  12 
5002,I currently have the lightest mass and it is still too much 
5003,That s the minimum
5004,Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks
5005, ? 
5006,I don t know how to find that info
5007,Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks
5008,We need to reduce mass if possible
5009,Im still at poor quality  are you as well ? 
5010,Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks
5011,no
5012,Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks
5013,We need to reduce mass if possible
5014,Is  70  the best value for bore design or have you not messed with it yet ? 
5015,and go max
5016,We need to reduce mass if possible
5017,We need to reduce mass if possible
5018,oh okay 
5019,Okay
5020,you said piston diameter is in your equation right ? 
5021,Im at  2 nd lowest mass
5022,ya  and im at poor quality  are you as well ? 
5023,dec mass
5024,yup
5025,nevermind just updated broadcast
5026,with what I have now my mass is the lowest it can be
5027,Just did max   105  
5028,Flywheel is thinking we need to reduce mass
5029,I think this is a trap
5030,ok
5031,how does the change in piston diameter affect your mass factor of safety
5032,my configuration has one of the lowest masses available atm
5033,they don t wanna give us  20  bucks
5034,mine is currently mass equals to  0   02  and factorofsafety equals to  0   22  but my max factorofsafety is  0   24 
5035,I can reduce the mass of the piston  but  it s going to cost a bit on factorofsafety  Drops factorofsafety by  1  ish
5036,Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important
5037,try reducing bearingoffset ? 
5038,i think this is a trap
5039,It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat I have communicated the same with the others 
5040,It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat I have communicated the same with the others 
5041,It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat I have communicated the same with the others 
5042,It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat I have communicated the same with the others 
5043,they don t wanna give us  20  bucks
5044,Awesome same here
5045,how does the piston bore diameter affect your equations ? 
5046,okay I agree  so I need minimal for me I am thinking  But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue ? 
5047,ok
5048,How is the factor of safety
5049,lol
5050,just saw that
5051,ok
5052,I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
5053,reduced to  150 
5054,group - go to mid range  follow crankshaft lead
5055,ok
5056,group - go to mid range  follow crankshaft lead
5057,who many rounds do we getr ? 
5058,group - go to mid range  follow crankshaft lead
5059,group - go to mid range  follow crankshaft lead
5060,get 
5061,lolololol
5062,i have been
5063,do you control piston bore diameter ? 
5064,do you control piston bore diameter ? 
5065,we need to lower our mass
5066,do you control piston bore diameter ? 
5067,what is the range of values you can choose ? 
5068,do you control piston bore diameter ? 
5069,I like it  I just broadcasted the parameter that has the highest factorofsafety for my lowest possible weight
5070,mine is  0   14  which is highest for my lowest mass option
5071,Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
5072,what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people ? 
5073,I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass  mass  equals to    16   fs  equals to   3   34   Sending this to everyone
5074,I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass  mass  equals to    16   fs  equals to   3   34   Sending this to everyone
5075,I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass  mass  equals to    16   fs  equals to   3   34   Sending this to everyone
5076,No I do flywheel diameter
5077,group : ok we need to reduce weight a lot
5078,what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people ? 
5079,group : ok we need to reduce weight a lot
5080,I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass  mass  equals to    16   fs  equals to   3   34   Sending this to everyone
5081,yes i do
5082,group : ok we need to reduce weight a lot
5083,I think I ve lowered it as much as possible without completely sacrificing factorofsafety
5084,group : ok we need to reduce weight a lot
5085,I can choose diameter between  75  and  105 
5086,see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
5087,my highest mass option is   03  so it might be best for me to just use that and get our highest factorofsafety
5088,wow english
5089,I have the piston set to near lowest mass  mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84   sending this to everyone
5090,I have the piston set to near lowest mass  mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84   sending this to everyone
5091,I have the piston set to near lowest mass  mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84   sending this to everyone
5092,larger piston bore increases both mass and factorofsafety
5093,My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 
5094,My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 
5095,group :  how much does your part currently weigh
5096,group :  how much does your part currently weigh
5097,group :  I can make piston head thickness  10   5   and diameter  90 
5098,mine depends on crankshaft
5099,My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 
5100,group :  I can make piston head thickness  10   5   and diameter  90

5103,My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 
5104,Agreed
5105,just because my mass probably has very little impact
5106,nothing actually
5107,group :  how much does your part currently weigh
5108,group :  how much does your part currently weigh
5109,I have the lowest mass configuration   0   55   and the highest factorofsafety   5625   setup currently  Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment 
5110,do u know how many rounds we get ? 
5111,I have the lowest mass configuration   0   55   and the highest factorofsafety   5625   setup currently  Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment 
5112,lower bore diameter ?  on it  I ll go down to  55  and see what we can get
5113,I have the lowest mass configuration   0   55   and the highest factorofsafety   5625   setup currently  Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment 
5114,I have the lowest mass configuration   0   55   and the highest factorofsafety   5625   setup currently  Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment 
5115,mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; 
5116,Yeah I ve taken that as low as possible without completely ruining factorofsafety  we also need to raise that
5117,what does thatdo ? 
5118, 10   7 
5119,is  60  the minimum you can go with the crankshaft
5120,mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; 
5121,What do your factorofsafety numbers look like ? 
5122,mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; 
5123,mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; 
5124,ya we can always change it too
5125,do you have flywheeldiameter ? 
5126,Moving bore diameter down to  55   that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on factorofsafety as much  Rod designer is cool with it
5127,ok for me larger piston bore increases mass and factorofsafety too
5128,no I just asked piston pin guy
5129,okay so I think i need a smaller Piston Bore diameter
5130,group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up
5131,group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up
5132, 0   24 
5133,group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up
5134,group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up
5135,there are rounds ? 
5136,I believe we all have lowest masses setup now  Make sure to check for broadcasts  We ll take it from there 
5137,I believe we all have lowest masses setup now  Make sure to check for broadcasts  We ll take it from there 
5138,yes
5139,What variables do you control ? 
5140,maximize factorofsafety
5141,mass _ s  :   1   08  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   0   83 
5142,I believe we all have lowest masses setup now  Make sure to check for broadcasts  We ll take it from there 
5143,to give the same factor of saftey and reduced weight
5144,I believe we all have lowest masses setup now  Make sure to check for broadcasts  We ll take it from there 
5145,I think the piston pin factorofsafety could be increased without costing too much mass
5146,my factorofsafety is  0   24 
5147,at the top it says round  2 
5148,Ok but what about the chart
5149, 60  mm
5150,can you get it to  60  ? 
5151,dope
5152,We need to increase factorofsafety
5153,with the different simulation numbers
5154,Idk if we have certain rounds or not
5155,ohhhi see  it goes all the way up to  80 
5156,what factors of the crank shaft ? 
5157,oh mine says  11 
5158,I think our current mass is larger than what we started
5159,Ok sounds good
5160,r 2  and r 3 
5161,My max is only  0   24  but I can increase it to  0   22  while only adding  0   01  mass
5162,i think its just the number of times youve broadcasted ? 
5163,just went up to   51  overall
5164,We have bore diameter down to  55  now  it lets us get a bit lighter
5165,How much mass ? 
5166,do you have flywheelthickness ? 
5167,group :  go to you lower most range with max factorofsafety and reasonable weight
5168,hey i think that made things better 
5169,group :  go to you lower most range with max factorofsafety and reasonable weight
5170,group :  go to you lower most range with max factorofsafety and reasonable weight
5171,what is your factor of safety ? 
5172,Yes
5173,group :  go to you lower most range with max factorofsafety and reasonable weight
5174,no idea
5175,piston guy controls it
5176,That might be worth it  Maybe tell the others you re doing that
5177,Ok
5178, 12  is the best I got
5179,group :  so factorofsafety is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
5180,what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people ? 
5181,wait so I asked piston to lower his mass  So now my factorofsafety is lowered to  70  
5182,interesting
5183,group - what does your design depend on  and how does it change mass and factorofsafety ? 
5184,group - what does your design depend on  and how does it change mass and factorofsafety ? 
5185,we are at fair
5186,group - what does your design depend on  and how does it change mass and factorofsafety ? 
5187,maybe use a smaller bearingoffset
5188,group - what does your design depend on  and how does it change mass and factorofsafety ? 
5189,group :  so factorofsafety is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
5190,What mass ranges do you have the option of ? 
5191,group :  so factorofsafety is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
5192,mass is to  4 
5193,bearing offset
5194,what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people ? 
5195,its as small as itll go
5196,I just updated it to that  I ll let the other people know
5197,yup just got that  asked piston to lower his mass  Just to see
5198,i brought it down
5199,if i can increase diameter and thickness in a similar ratio  both mass and factorofsafety increase
5200,i can go lower but it ss reduce factorofsafety
5201, 15886   04 
5202,do you wanna lower the mass further to see what we get or no ? 
5203,I just updated mass y settings to mass equals to  0   02  and factorofsafety equals to  0   22 
5204,group :  so factorofsafety is good now lets concentrate on slight weight reductions
5205,best I get
5206,What is your current mass ? 
5207,Ok  We need total to be less than  3   My part costs roughly  0   6  when combined with the piston-pin 
5208,that works
5209,do those have names or are they just called that  I think you might control something I mass not seeing for some reason
5210,make sure crank shaft guy knows that and try to figure out how an increase or decrease in that effect the factorofsafety and the mass
5211,increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
5212,Ok  I just updated my settings to be mass equals to  0   02  and factorofsafety equals to  0   22 
5213,pistonborediameter flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness
5214, to everyone I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and factorofsafety went up
5215,I mass at lowest mass for  55  bore diameter  I can step down to  47   5  bore diameter and that might help
5216, to everyone I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and factorofsafety went up
5217,I think you need to reduce the mass a bit
5218, to everyone I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and factorofsafety went up
5219, 150 
5220, to everyone I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and factorofsafety went up
5221,but my mass is max  1   61  kg so its very small percent
5222,what mass are you getting ? 
5223,wow that is large
5224,yup thats working 
5225,what mass are you getting ? 
5226,that s better than poor
5227,group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
5228,group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
5229,group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
5230,group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
5231,is there anything i can do ? 
5232,what mass are you using ? 
5233,Do you know who controls those factors ? 
5234, 1   8  to  4   72   I mass currently at  2   14  but can drop to  1   96  without loosing too much factorofsafety
5235,What are the weight and factorofsafety ranges for your part ?  Mine are   12  to  3   85  kg   2  to  60  for factorofsafety  Sending to everyone
5236,i have  1   27 
5237,What are the weight and factorofsafety ranges for your part ?  Mine are   12  to  3   85  kg   2  to  60  for factorofsafety  Sending to everyone
5238,So what is your bearingoffset value ? 
5239,diameter and thickness
5240,What are the weight and factorofsafety ranges for your part ?  Mine are   12  to  3   85  kg   2  to  60  for factorofsafety  Sending to everyone
5241,i have one more setting before im at my lowest
5242,oh the round number is the simulation number
5243,What are the weight and factorofsafety ranges for your part ?  Mine are   12  to  3   85  kg   2  to  60  for factorofsafety  Sending to everyone
5244,my mass is kinda less
5245,Please do
5246, 150 
5247,Check for broadcast now
5248,Check for broadcast now
5249,Check for broadcast now
5250,Check for broadcast now
5251,its as low as itll go
5252,yeah  what is factorofsafety ? 
5253,can you try increasing flywheeldiameter ? 
5254,Do you have an option of an factorofsafety of at least  1  ? 
5255,and what is your factorofsafety ? 
5256,for mass ? 
5257,current mass is  1   46 
5258,and factorofsafety ? 
5259,I mass gonna switch down to  47   5  diameter for a sec and see what happens  I can increase factorofsafety a bunch by doing that and only add a small bit of mass
5260,on my broadcast thing theyre just called r 2  and r 3   r 2  is the ratio of piston pin length to diameter and r 3  is piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
5261,Currently I think the mass is too much 
5262,mass _ s  :   1   46  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   1   32  ; 
5263,Whats your lowest mass ? 
5264,Currently I think the mass is too much 
5265,what current mass and factorofsafety do you have ? 
5266,can you increase bearingoffset value to max i wanna see how it effects my values
5267,cuz mine depends on that
5268,one sec
5269,sorry i wrote backwards  increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
5270,mine is  0   45  to  4   43 kg   1   46  to  31   19  for factorofsafety
5271,try getting factorofsafety above  3  without increasing mass too much
5272,my lowest mass is  0   12   im currently at  0   37 
5273,makes it way worse
5274,done
5275,i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
5276,i agree with that
5277,try increasing your factorofsafety without increasing mass too much
5278,There ? 
5279,my maxium factorofsafety is  1   35 
5280,Ok were good on mass for now 
5281,Flywheel mass :  from  0   52  to  1   0   factorofsafety from  701  to  5625  
5282,hmmm okay
5283,Flywheel mass :  from  0   52  to  1   0   factorofsafety from  701  to  5625  
5284,Flywheel mass :  from  0   52  to  1   0   factorofsafety from  701  to  5625  
5285,I get better values when it is smaller
5286,ok so if you increase bearingoffset my factorofsafety goes down but weight is not effected
5287,my projected outputs changed now im at mass  1   14  and factorofsafety 1   32 
5288,mass _ s  :   10   4  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   7   37  ; 
5289,Flywheel mass :  from  0   52  to  1   0   factorofsafety from  701  to  5625  
5290,wait in the complete range ? 
5291,me too
5292,we ve gotta figure out how all the other factors connect
5293, to everyone  Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight   0   05   and mas factorofsafety   0   51  
5294, to everyone  Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight   0   05   and mas factorofsafety   0   51  
5295,its as small as itll go
5296,awesome  i think this will help  Should I go to my lowest setting or no ?  Im on my second to lowest setting right now
5297, to everyone  Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight   0   05   and mas factorofsafety   0   51  
5298,yea as low it gets my factorofsafety shoots up
5299,the minimum it gives me is  150 
5300, to everyone  Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight   0   05   and mas factorofsafety   0   51  
5301,min weight  :   0   5 kg  max weight  :   1   61  kg
5302,ok it went up to  300  rn
5303,okay  so you part and my part are the heaviest
5304,ok my weight goes up a lot with increase bearingoffset and reduced factorofsafety
5305,and factorofsafety
5306,oh okay my handout said piston pin diameter should be displayed but isnt
5307,so bearingoffset low ? 
5308,but we need to increase factor of saftey
5309,there
5310,min factorofsafety  equals to    38   max factorofsafety  1   32 
5311,Can you send me your mass ? 
5312,mine is  0   45  to  4   43 kg   1   46  to  31   19  for factorofsafety
5313,try that
5314,do you control pistonborediameter flywheeldiameter or flywheelthickness ? 
5315,What is your max factorofsafety ?  I think it would be worth it to try and get above  1 
5316, 1   35  i mean
5317,Can you send me your mass ? 
5318,We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? 
5319, 1 
5320,Can you send me your mass ? 
5321,Can you send me your mass ? 
5322,i am maxed out i think
5323,it s not set to the lowest atm
5324,We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? 
5325,flywheel is  0   52  currently
5326,range for piston is  0   45  to  4   43 kg   1   46  to  31   19  for factorofsafety
5327,We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? 
5328,We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? 
5329,ok back to lowest bearingoffset
5330,yeah don t do that lol
5331,Do you need dc ? 
5332,That is my current max factorofsafety  It can change some based on what piston diameter I have
5333,back to poor
5334,I changed to  0   37   factorofsafety of  11  
5335, 3 
5336, 150  is lowest right ? 
5337,sorry yes   90  mm for bore pistonborediameter  I control the r values
5338,yes
5339,sorry hit the wrong button fixed it
5340,what parameters do you have ? 
5341,are you working with others ?  Flywheel only depends on crankshaft and it will only affect crankshaft so Idk what to do with others
5342,can you share your equations ? 
5343,whats dc
5344,what parameters do you have ? 
5345,piston pin has flywheeldiameter
5346,and i think pistonborediameter
5347,bearing support offest
5348,Crankshaft  1   08  kg
5349,can you look in the ranges
5350,Crankshaft  1   08  kg
5351,no
5352,my factorofsafety is max right now at  1   23  and mass of  0   07 
5353,Crankshaft  1   08  kg
5354,ok
5355,Crankshaft  1   08  kg
5356,I think we re   1  over now  Best options I have to increase factorofsafety would also lead to lowering bore diameter  IDK how that effects you
5357,crankshaft hit the wrong button that is why i think it went back to poor
5358,do you need to work with bearingoffset ? 
5359,okay  what mass are you at 
5360,Im currently broadcasting bearingoffset  60  dc  10  which is mass   99  and factorofsafety   67 
5361,no i do not
5362,I have thickness as  12  and diameter as  60 
5363, what values is everyone in control of
5364, 0   05  kg
5365,It might be worth it to converse with them to see if you can get a better factorofsafety  I feel like if one part has a much lower factorofsafety than the others  it ll hinder the overall build
5366,sorry  dc 
5367,I can increase my mass toi  0   75  and my factorofsafety to  24   38 
5368, what values is everyone in control of
5369, what values is everyone in control of
5370,  ? 
5371, what values is everyone in control of
5372,no
5373,I mass confident I mass at my optimal setting  No others even close 
5374,Only way to get higher factorofsafety at  1   32  is to raise weight to  1   14 
5375,can you share all your variables
5376, 1   27 
5377,I mass confident I mass at my optimal setting  No others even close 
5378,i will compile
5379,I mass confident I mass at my optimal setting  No others even close 
5380,I mass confident I mass at my optimal setting  No others even close 
5381,I control the r values which will change the mass and the factorofsafety
5382, ?  ? 
5383,and factorofsafety  0 f  15 k
5384,can you lower the r values
5385,are you conerned with dimension dc ? 
5386,I meant shaft diameter
5387,can you please share your variables with just the letters
5388,Yeah I agree  I ll see what they can do
5389,pistonborediameter
5390,i think that will raise my factorofsafety and lower weight
5391,Sorry  mass  25   69   factorofsafety  1   45 
5392,which do you need
5393,if you read design variables section on the sheet
5394,and t _ H
5395,I control the r values
5396,It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting factorofsafety  Maybe close to   6  ? 
5397,can you please share your variables with just the letters
5398,Alright sounds good  Does the bore diameter effect you at all ? 
5399,what you need and what you have
5400,I have two I can jump behind but it depends on what everyone else can get mass and factorofsafety to
5401,it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on
5402,yes can do
5403,yeah im at what i think is the best spot too
5404,My current factorofsafety is  5625   56 
5405,No idea
5406,who are you working with ? 
5407,i need bearingoffset  t _ f  flywheeldiameter
5408,I control bearing support offset  bearingoffset  and crank-pin diameter  pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset 
5409,My current factorofsafety is  5625   56 
5410,no i know but i was just seeing who had what
5411,I think we need a larger shaft diameter and smaller thickness
5412,tf- 27 
5413,My current factorofsafety is  5625   56 
5414,okay  stay at that point
5415,ds- 60 
5416,My current factorofsafety is  5625   56 
5417,Can you change piston diamter without affecting your factorofsafety and mass much ?  With the current diamteter my max factorofsafety is only  0   51 
5418,don t change for sometine
5419,changing piston currently has  0  effect on factorofsafety whatsoever
5420,Maybe ?  Try it and see what happens
5421,What do you mean ?   0   52  is my minimum mass
5422,changing piston currently has  0  effect on factorofsafety whatsoever
5423,wait  can you reduce the mass
5424,changing piston currently has  0  effect on factorofsafety whatsoever
5425,changing piston currently has  0  effect on factorofsafety whatsoever
5426,can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera ? 
5427,oh wow haha okay
5428,well mine is only related to yours 
5429,is there any way you can make our factorofsafety increase
5430,can you share your variable letters  what you control and what you need 
5431,Is that the lowest mass setting without compromising factorofsafety
5432,i don t need dc
5433,ok and which do you depend on
5434,group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod ?   t 1  or r 1    thickness or length 
5435,but you might have to reduce mass
5436,Yes but that will also reduce factorofsafety and I am the lowest at  1   45  rn
5437,i did try it a few minutes ago  did anythjing change ?  Ill try it again
5438,Current config is good remember these settings on your paper  Lets call this plan A
5439,group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod ?   t 1  or r 1    thickness or length 
5440,group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod ?   t 1  or r 1    thickness or length 
5441,A bit  I can lower bore diameter
5442,group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod ?   t 1  or r 1    thickness or length 
5443,Current config is good remember these settings on your paper  Lets call this plan A
5444,Thats great  let s see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
5445,and which do you need
5446,Current config is good remember these settings on your paper  Lets call this plan A
5447,Current config is good remember these settings on your paper  Lets call this plan A
5448,ok i am not gonna change without letting yopu know
5449,also how much does bore diameter effect you ?  If i go down to the lowest bore diameter I can increase factorofsafety a bit
5450,ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
5451,Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already ? 
5452,what r do you have for the pin ? 
5453,I lowered the r values  It did lower the weight  but the factorofsafety is too low now
5454,what is your range for mass ? 
5455,For the current bore diameter  yes  If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results
5456,My bad that wasn t clear  I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high factorofsafety to begin with
5457,Ok  I now have factorofsafety options over  1 
5458,pistonborediameter  pistonborediameter _ s  and t _ f  but I don t know how to use those
5459,i depennd on bearingoffset
5460,thickness is at lowest
5461,hmmm im not sure
5462,Whats your factorofsafety
5463,thats high my max factorofsafety doesn t even go above  1   23 
5464,do you depend on my variables ? 
5465,connecting rod thickness  t 1   and connecting rod length ratio  r 1  
5466,because i believe your part is the heaviest
5467,those values give the best factorofsafety value ans  2 nd lowest mass
5468,no i do not  i am compiling everyones
5469,i depend on the piston
5470,Lets improve lowest factorofsafety now  What is yours ? 
5471,and 
5472,Lets improve lowest factorofsafety now  What is yours ? 
5473,Yeah  the flywheel won t break  so i was just minimizing mass
5474,I dont think it affects much  not too sure  Lets give it a go
5475,Lets improve lowest factorofsafety now  What is yours ? 
5476,Lets improve lowest factorofsafety now  What is yours ? 
5477,group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter
5478,group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter
5479,group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter
5480,group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter
5481,i do
5482,mine is  1200 
5483,Mine only changes when yours change lol
5484,my lowest factorofsafety is  1   46   max is  31   19 
5485,Could you try decreasing it again ?  I mass trying to raise my factorofsafety more since my mass is so small
5486,Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by   15  while also increasing factorofsafety by   65 
5487,I had r 2  equals to   75   and r 3  equals to   68  and that gave an okay factorofsafety  but I just lowered it to r 2  equals to   7  and r 3  equals to   55  which lowered the factorofsafety too much
5488,You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his her mass  crankshaft is the heaviest part
5489,is there any way you can increase factorofsafety
5490,try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
5491,my current factorofsafety is   67  and I think it should be above one
5492, 20   86   mass of   6  
5493,Alright  I mass on lowest bore diameter now  Mass  equals to    91   factorofsafety  equals to   7   37

5520,we re good now
5521,My factorofsafety is currently maxed out at  1   23  but I mass trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
5522,we re good now
5523,What is your range of factorofsafety ? 
5524,My factorofsafety is currently maxed out at  1   23  but I mass trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
5525,Thats a good option
5526,okay now weight is down  but factorofsafety is a tad too low
5527,what do you need
5528,currently on lowest diameter
5529,check what you have now  piston changed
5530,currently with the rod designer
5531,It s getting better  keep it up

5537,sounds good  flywheel now needs to check theirs i think
5538,What s the factorofsafety of your current selection ?  I mass trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over factorofsafety
5539, we only need to decrease mass now
5540,Current settings seem to just hit the min values  seems like a good reference point   all 
5541, pistonborediameter  piston bore
5542,What s the factorofsafety of your current selection ?  I mass trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over factorofsafety
5543,i think everyone else has more influence than i do  my max factorofsafety i can go to is  1   23  at the moment and my max mass is 0   07 
5544,Current settings seem to just hit the min values  seems like a good reference point   all 
5545,it looks like we are at good now
5546,What s the factorofsafety of your current selection ?  I mass trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over factorofsafety
5547,group :  one change at a time  let crankshaft change and then he she can let us know 
5548,Current settings seem to just hit the min values  seems like a good reference point   all 
5549,Current settings seem to just hit the min values  seems like a good reference point   all 
5550,do you depend on t 1  or r 1  ? 
5551,group :  one change at a time  let crankshaft change and then he she can let us know 
5552,ok i raised dc and things got better haha
5553,group :  one change at a time  let crankshaft change and then he she can let us know 
5554,we can try smaller mass
5555,no only pistonborediameter
5556,group :  one change at a time  let crankshaft change and then he she can let us know 
5557, 5625   56 
5558,Yeah I was about to ask that and i think you are right
5559,factorofsafety is very good
5560,to do that should I lower r  which could lower our factorofsafety too much
5561,My current factorofsafety in my table is  1   11 
5562,alright
5563,kmaybe not
5564,Have you been changing the piston and seeing how the piston-pin can be changed ? 
5565,I think factorofsafety might depend on me then
5566,Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes
5567,im happy with that lol
5568,Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes
5569,Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes
5570,yeah if it lowers factorofsafety too much  weshouldnt
5571,Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes
5572,can you change yours ?  Piston and flywheel just changed theres
5573,sweet we just need to get mass down
5574,GROUP :  crankshaft done  factorofsafety is great  mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good  piston goes next
5575,GROUP :  crankshaft done  factorofsafety is great  mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good  piston goes next
5576,Well the flywheel has a factorofsafety of  5625   56 
5577,according to the thing on the screen it says very good
5578,GROUP :  crankshaft done  factorofsafety is great  mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good  piston goes next
5579,yes but then mass would increadse
5580,GROUP :  crankshaft done  factorofsafety is great  mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good  piston goes next
5581, Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time ? 
5582,do you depend on t 1  or r 1  ? 
5583,Ive changed it and I can sway the overall by roughly  0   1  by adding  0   03  mass
5584,piston pin had been able to hit factorofsafety of  1  at one point  was usually below  1 
5585,I think he influences it the most
5586,no I don t need either
5587,Something just took a hit  Any idea what changed ? 
5588,okay
5589,group :  i changed my part 
5590,what option are you currently on
5591,group :  i changed my part 
5592,Group- only piston engineer edits
5593,group :  i changed my part 
5594,group :  i changed my part 
5595,Group- only piston engineer edits
5596,Group- only piston engineer edits
5597,how much does your factorofsafety increase though ?  because then we could save mass in other parts
5598,yessir
5599,Group- only piston engineer edits
5600,group :  who s next ? 
5601,What is your factorofsafety ? 
5602,group :  who s next ? 
5603,mass  1   14  factorofsafety  1   32 
5604,no way
5605,group :  who s next ? 
5606,you done ? 
5607,group :  who s next ? 
5608,do you depend on t 1  or r 1  ? 
5609, 11   3 
5610,no
5611,piston change :  cur mass  equals to   1   0 kg   cur factorofsafety  equals to   4   56 
5612,do you depend on t 1  or r 1  ? 
5613,piston change :  cur mass  equals to   1   0 kg   cur factorofsafety  equals to   4   56 
5614, So if I decrease mass  factorofsafety will decrease by  10000   So I would not do anything
5615,Ok  I can now get factorofsafety of over  3  for   12  kg so it works well for me but if you need to change it I can try other settings
5616,piston change :  cur mass  equals to   1   0 kg   cur factorofsafety  equals to   4   56 
5617,it s just good
5618,ok nvm
5619,yes
5620,The piston pin is pretty important though so id say maximize mass for factorofsafety if you can
5621,piston change :  cur mass  equals to   1   0 kg   cur factorofsafety  equals to   4   56 
5622, 24   3  at mass  equals to    75 
5623,But I have the minimum factorofsafety so I ll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
5624,i control Ti and r 1 
5625,flywheel unchanged    0   52  kg and factorofsafety  1215 
5626,below  45  weight and above  2  factorofsafety for auto engine design

5665,Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest factorofsafety will fail first  so they re factorofsafety is the most important  What do you think ? 
5666,ok cause I have lowest factorofsafety so ill fail first meaning overall factorofsafety depends on me
5667,what do you control

5674,no one depends on mine either
5675,Can you reduce piston factorofsafety ? 
5676,yes  I can get up to a factorofsafety of  3  at  45  but only  1   23  at  47   5 
5677,t 1  and r 1 
5678,I think i have my ideal broadcast
5679,We are compromising mass
5680,updated mass to   46   factorofsafety to  10   7 
5681,I think i have my ideal broadcast
5682,We had fair a minute ago  who has been making changes ?  I haven t changed anything
5683,We had fair a minute ago  who has been making changes ?  I haven t changed anything
5684,We had fair a minute ago  who has been making changes ?  I haven t changed anything
5685,We had fair a minute ago  who has been making changes ?  I haven t changed anything
5686,updated mass to   46   factorofsafety to  10   7 
5687,I think i have my ideal broadcast
5688,updated mass to   46   factorofsafety to  10   7 
5689,I think i have my ideal broadcast
5690,updated mass to   46   factorofsafety to  10   7 
5691,Whoever just changed something about factorofsafety change it back   It made it worse
5692,group - same with piston-pin
5693,group - same with piston-pin
5694,group - same with piston-pin
5695,group - same with piston-pin
5696,Whoever just changed something about factorofsafety change it back   It made it worse
5697,i dont think it actually changes the factorofsafety
5698,Whoever just changed something about factorofsafety change it back   It made it worse
5699,me too
5700,Group :  alert everyone before you change anything 
5701,Group :  alert everyone before you change anything 
5702,Group :  alert everyone before you change anything 
5703,that makes sense  i just maxed my factorofsafety right now
5704,Group :  alert everyone before you change anything 
5705,Not sure  I didn t change anything  I let all the others know
5706,which I just tried but someone else must have made a change at the same time
5707,mine has been constant from last change
5708,okay i ust put my factorofsafety to  63   did it affect it much ? 
5709,Its probably weighted  If we can raise the lowest factorofsafety to its max and the highest factorofsafety to its min mass it might work
5710,flywheel  are you good ? 
5711,just to see is it the one with the lowest ms and highest factorofsafety in the far right column ? 
5712,okay i just put my factorofsafety to  63   did it affect it much ? 
5713,Yeah its down to like   67  now
5714,I decreases mass bu  0   04  and decreased factorofsafety by  2  due to piston changes
5715,if I reduce piston factorofsafety overall factorofsafety goes down a lot
5716,Are you done flywheel ? 
5717,same
5718,mass equals to  0   07  factorofsafety equals to  1   23 
5719,mass equals to  0   07  factorofsafety equals to  1   23 
5720,grp-im done
5721,I raised mine to  2   28  so someone made a change to something much lower than that
5722,should i switch back then ? 
5723,grp-im done
5724,grp-im done
5725,grp-im done
5726,Lets try and get back to where Fair was  that seemed like the right track
5727,Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead
5728,GROUP :  flywheel done for now  please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w o factorofsafety under  2 
5729,GROUP :  flywheel done for now  please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w o factorofsafety under  2 
5730,Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead
5731,GROUP :  flywheel done for now  please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w o factorofsafety under  2 
5732,Group :  I will decrease mine now
5733,group :  who wants to go next ? 
5734,you next ? 
5735,Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead
5736,so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety
5737,GROUP :  flywheel done for now  please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w o factorofsafety under  2 
5738,Group :  I will decrease mine now
5739,Group :  I will decrease mine now
5740,Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead
5741,a little someone else is messing around with their factorofsafety
5742,cool  I ll let everyone else know
5743,group :  who wants to go next ? 
5744,Group :  I will decrease mine now
5745,whats your factorofsafety now ? 
5746,group :  who wants to go next ? 
5747,group :  who wants to go next ? 
5748,so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety
5749,group-piston pin now
5750,we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side  We want a factorofsafety just above  2  and weight below  35 
5751,group-piston pin now
5752,agreed
5753,still maxed at  1   23 
5754,Can you improve factorofsafety ? 
5755,so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety
5756,connecting rod :  hold on  piston pin changing 
5757,group-piston pin now
5758,New plan  All of us are going to max factorofsafety  and then worry about mass
5759,group-piston pin now
5760,so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety
5761,we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side  We want a factorofsafety just above  2  and weight below  35 
5762,sweet
5763,New plan  All of us are going to max factorofsafety  and then worry about mass
5764,we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side  We want a factorofsafety just above  2  and weight below  35 
5765,New plan  All of us are going to max factorofsafety  and then worry about mass
5766,YOurs is currently the bottleneck
5767,we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side  We want a factorofsafety just above  2  and weight below  35 
5768,lol i think its flywheel haha
5769,overall factorofsafety is decreawseing
5770,Lets see what happens ? 
5771,GROUP :  ok I see piston-pin  that works too
5772,Flywheel guy is also in on it
5773,so keep playing with your parameters and ill let you know how it impacts me
5774,yep okay
5775,GROUP :  ok I see piston-pin  that works too
5776,GROUP :  ok I see piston-pin  that works too
5777,what is your current mass and factorofsafety ? 
5778,GROUP :  ok I see piston-pin  that works too
5779,Flywheel guy is also in on it
5780,what is your current mass and factorofsafety ? 
5781,yeah
5782,Flywheel guy is also in on it
5783,yo the far right column  should we just pick the one with the lowest ms and highest factorofsafety
5784,piston pin designer is having trouble maxing out his factorofsafety
5785,MASS :   25   95   factorofsafety  2   27 
5786,what is your current and factorofsafety 
5787,okay im at max factorofsafety
5788,i know
5789,okay im at max factorofsafety
5790,what is your current mass and factorofsafety 
5791,mas-  1   23  fos-  12   2 k
5792,decrease urs now
5793,Not with the current piston parameters  I ll see if he can change things so I can get a factorofsafety back over  3 
5794,piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
5795,Group :  no more changes 
5796,Group :  no more changes 
5797,but the far right column is the projected values for them and I think the ideal broadcast is the one with the best projected values
5798,Group :  no more changes 
5799,Group :  no more changes 
5800,Can you try decreasing diameter back to  45  ? 
5801,At max factorofsafety
5802,At max factorofsafety
5803,I mass working with Piston to improve my factorofsafety
5804,At max factorofsafety
5805,At max factorofsafety
5806,wait lower your mass a bit
5807,On it
5808,Are we good to end ? 
5809,should we end ? 
5810,We at fair  Good enough ? 
5811,We at fair  Good enough ? 
5812,We at fair  Good enough ? 
5813,We at fair  Good enough ? 
5814,hi
5815,What kind of bore diameter are you thinking ? 
5816,hi
5817,Lower rather than higher works better on my end
5818,how are you
5819, 82   5   that is the second lowest for me
5820,thanks
5821,Hey 
5822,Hey
5823,What s the best crankshaft offset ? 
5824,i dont know what to do
5825, 150  is working pretty well for me right now
5826,Ok  I will try that now
5827,what is the offset you have decided to use for the crannkshaft bearing offset ? 
5828,Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller ? 
5829,Do you have any idea about the pistonborediameter value ? 
5830,Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness ? 
5831,The lowest offset possible would be ideal for the mass and factorofsafety for the crankshaft
5832,Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller ?  What about the flywheel shaft diameter ? 
5833,Hey
5834,increasing the bore diameter will increase the factor of safety as well as increase weight
5835,Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset  bearingoffset 
5836,What s a good working piston bore diameter ? 
5837,what s your current piston bore diameter ? 
5838,What value would be ideal for the flywheel ? 
5839,bearingoffset  equals to   150 
5840,I have found a piston bore diameter of around  90  to be best for me
5841,doth pistonborediameter and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass
5842,I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
5843,what bore diameter are you using ? 
5844,try  41   25  for t _ f and  45  for diameter
5845,So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably
5846, 82   5  i was thinking  the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
5847,Can I have a current value of pistonborediameter
5848,i just clicked broadcast
5849,current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
5850,I am thinking  82   5  which is the second smallest
5851,Hi
5852,Hi
5853,Hi
5854,if i make the piston diameter smaller  my factorofsafety goes up
5855,that works for me too
5856,yeah that makes sense
5857,Hi
5858,i agree  another component needs to be slimmed down  currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
5859,Got it thanks
5860,I think that works  i mass not sure how that affects the flyweel but I will change it to offset of  60  which is minimum
5861,gotchya thanks
5862,alright awesome
5863,Hi  looks like we should increase the factor of safety  What factor of safety do you have for the piston
5864,thats the pistonpin i think  rn i have piston diameter of  90 
5865,Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
5866, 40 
5867,What do you currently have for your bore diameter ? 
5868,Is there a way to see the other values ?  The main one updates but I can t see others 
5869,t _ h is currently  2 
5870,y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 
5871,is your current value exactly  90  ? 
5872,what is your piston bore diameter ?   40  ? 
5873,y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 
5874,Do you have piston bore diameter ?  pistonborediameter 
5875,y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 
5876,right now its  40  yes
5877,What is the factor of safety of the connecting rod at the moment ? 
5878,and t _ h is  2 
5879, 55 
5880,what bore diameter are you using ? 
5881,My factorofsafety is at  2   29  
5882,I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
5883,yes
5884,Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components ? 
5885,lmk if you change it
5886,i believe  90 
5887,how you doing
5888,piston controls it
5889,will do
5890,Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components ? 
5891,yeah right now i have a piston diameter of  90  and head thickness of  7   25 
5892,I think it s at  2  right now
5893,what is your current value for flywheel shaft diameter ? 
5894,but  90  is best for us
5895,Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components ? 
5896, 90 
5897,Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components ? 
5898,No neither of thos eaffect the crankshaft
5899,I don t think so
5900,ok
5901,Have you changed bore diameter at all ? 
5902,ok
5903,and piston diameter will affect my performance quality
5904,It s  3   41 
5905,What s your current factorofsafety ? 
5906,what can we do in terms of slimming down mass
5907,flywheeldiameter  equals to   50 
5908,thanks
5909,so lower piston diamter lowers your factorofsafety ? 
5910,let me check real quick
5911,What s your current factorofsafety ? 
5912,ok  i mass gonna try different thckness of I section on the rod as well as the conrod length
5913,no problem
5914,Ok now it dropped
5915,Ok  then I think minimizing offset it fine
5916, 3   11 
5917,see what the other group members say
5918,Would increasing or decreasing flywheeldiameter lower the weight ? 
5919,Is there a way to lower that ?  Mass is way too high and factorofsafety too low
5920,sounds good
5921, 4706 
5922,nope
5923,What s is the factor of safety for the piston-pin ? 
5924,Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value
5925,Yeah
5926,Idon t have that information  but check the front page of your packet
5927,No i changed headthickness piston head thickness but not the diameter
5928,Can we lower that ?  It might drop mass 
5929,Thanks  What s your factorofsafety ? 
5930,what are you factorofsafety Ms at rn ? 
5931,what are you factorofsafety Ms at rn ? 
5932,I think it could be a little lower since a factor of safety above  2  is considered excellent
5933,what are you factorofsafety Ms at rn ? 
5934, 2   36 
5935,how much does does the thickness of rod effect the factor of safety
5936,what are you factorofsafety Ms at rn ? 
5937,Im still waiting for the piston diameter  but with the lowest piston diameter of  40   my factorofsafety is  2   03  with a mass of  0   05 
5938,Right now  1   26  but before it was  2   09 
5939,mine :  ms  1   07   factorofsafety  35   82 
5940,mine :  ms  1   07   factorofsafety  35   82 
5941,I will need the piston diameter
5942,mine :  ms  1   07   factorofsafety  35   82 
5943,what s your design variables ? 
5944,mine :  ms  1   07   factorofsafety  35   82 
5945, 200  for offset works better for me
5946,once you figure it out
5947, 1   26  but before it was  2   09 
5948,My fs is  2   27  and mass is  19   96 
5949,also  can you give me flywheelthickness  flywheel thickness  ? 
5950,sure
5951,factorofsafety ? 
5952,Gotcha
5953,Ms equals to   1   15   factorofsafety  2   29  Next option is  2   29  
5954,basically I mass never selecting an factorofsafety below  2 
5955,flywheelthickness  equals to   12 
5956,Does  2   09  affect mass significantly ? 
5957,How does the bearing support offset affect your part ? 
5958,I have around  10 
5959,It s down to  3   22  with the current bore diameter
5960,thanks
5961,the smaller those two values are  the lighter the part is  but it gets weaker
5962,It does not affect my part
5963,for me still mass equals to  3   82  factorofsafety  1   46 
5964,what are your design variables ? 
5965, 1   3  kg so not really
5966,flyehweel thickness and flywheel shaft diameter
5967,I currently have  10  for thickness and  17   5  for diameter
5968,Wow that s pretty high  Bearing support offset and crank-pin diameter
5969,go for the lower Ms that has an factorofsafety above  2 
5970,I mass trying to pick a middle value
5971,Does the crank-pin diameter affect your part ? 
5972,ok im going to bump mind to midrange to see how much the mass increases
5973,ms :   1   71   factorofsafety :   4   55 
5974,The bore diameter as of right now is  55  I believe
5975,great minds think alike
5976,try  51  for t and  50  for flywheeldiameter
5977,What are your design variables ? 
5978,increase the bore diameter if you need to
5979,does a larger diameter increase your mass ?  or decrease it ? 
5980,My bad  currently at best option  Lowest mass  higher factorofsafety
5981, ;  
5982,That is my highest factorofsafety value
5983,Ima try a factorofsafety of  3   14  with a mass of  7   71 
5984,What are your design variables ? 
5985,same bore diameter
5986,Only the piston diameter pistonborediameter affects my part
5987,increases it
5988,Can you lower your diameter a touch ?  My options depend only on that 
5989,So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
5990,should we try  85  for dia ? 
5991,Our mass just increased a lot
5992,So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
5993,my mass values range from  1   13  to  3   12 
5994,So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
5995,gotcha  try  85  then
5996,and factorofsafety is very low
5997,the piston wont respond to me
5998,cool  if you can minimize mass with a higher factorofsafety  do that
5999,will do
6000,Our mass just increased a lot
6001,so let s lower our weight first
6002,Our mass just increased a lot
6003,Our mass just increased a lot
6004,so let s lower our weight first
6005,so let s lower our weight first
6006,and factorofsafety is very low
6007,yup trying  85  now
6008,and factorofsafety is very low
6009,did you change the bore diameter ? 
6010,i dont have  85   i have  82   5 
6011,and factorofsafety is very low
6012,does it auto update or do we have to refresh or something
6013,Thickness and rod length to crank length ratio
6014,mine says  4   26  and  0   6 
6015,now the whole part is  3   86 
6016,were at very good rn
6017, 82   5  actually
6018,next smallest i can go to is  75  and thats the minimum
6019,Is either flywheelthickness or flywheeldiameter a variable of other subsystems for you ? 
6020, 82   5  is good
6021,were at very good rn
6022,Yeah I put my thickness and diameter to make ms equals to  0   52 
6023,Can you find a way to increase the factorofsafety for your component ? 
6024,okay  the bearing support offset should be minimized for my part and an increasing crank pin diameter increases my factorofsafety
6025,ey ywe did it
6026,Its at very good
6027,Okay  We re probably at the best we can do  Will talk to other designerd 
6028,Good job team
6029,we have exceleent
6030,yea our values are horrible
6031,since if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely
6032,its at very good
6033,we got it  don t change things
6034,Update it I mass at excellent now
6035,as long as you dont dramatically decrease your factorofsafety because i think most oif it is coming from you
6036,good job team
6037,we got it  don t change things
6038,we have excellent
6039,we got it  don t change things
6040,ok we are good
6041,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6042,Don t change anything 
6043,good job team
6044,we got it  don t change things
6045,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6046,if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely
6047,and we need all the help we can get with fs
6048,nice
6049,good job team
6050,we have excellent rn
6051,Don t change it 
6052,if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely
6053,Sounds good
6054,No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
6055,gg team
6056,niceee haha
6057,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6058,Don t change it 
6059,gg team
6060,gg team
6061,gg team
6062, 9193 
6063,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6064,Sounds good
6065,greatjob
6066,Yeah I am happy with this gg
6067, ? 
6068,gg
6069,great job
6070,we are in excellent right now
6071,Nevermind
6072,What external variables affect your design ? 
6073,great job
6074,great job
6075,you too 
6076,Good job
6077, :  
6078,let me reduce the pistonborediameter to  40 
6079, :  
6080,It only matters about our lowest one I believe
6081, :  
6082,one second
6083, :  
6084,The crank-pin diameter and bearing support offset are my variables
6085,Isnt our factorofsafety about which part has the lowest ? 
6086,Hell to the yeah
6087,is it possible to increase your factor of safety ? 
6088, 4   55  which is my highest
6089,my mass is  1   71 
6090,It looks a little better now
6091,my mass values range from  1   13  to  3   12 
6092,bets on who goes rogue
6093,i think the other designers are gridlocked as far as influencing the factor of safetuy
6094,lets not change anything and get that   20 
6095,flywheel
6096,agreed
6097,what is your factorofsafety for the  1   13  ? 
6098,awfully quiet over there
6099, 0   57 
6100,he and i talked
6101,crankshaft bearing offset
6102,but im stillsuspicious
6103,Lets not change anything and get that   20 
6104, he or she
6105,Do you know whose factorofsafety is the lowest at the moment ? 
6106,Lets not change anything and get that   20 
6107,Lets not change anything and get that   20 
6108,we arent at excellent we would have to drop the weight around  2 kg
6109,lets take bets on who goes rogue
6110,No  Mine is  2   36 
6111,im guessing flywheel
6112,But  17   is not to shabby
6113, ERROR 
6114,What are your values
6115,What is your factorofsafety right now ? 
6116,Yes please 
6117,gotta be inclusive gosh
6118,what is your factorofsafety right now ? 
6119, 
6120,look at the chart on the last page of your booklet  we are shooting for the highest factorofsafety and lowest mass
6121,Sounds good I won t touch it
6122,yeahh i dont trust em
6123,it says excellent for me
6124,I got factorofsafety  2   36 
6125,i dont know the piston diameter
6126,ms equals to  0   52  factorofsafety equals to  1215 
6127,what is your factorofsafety right now ? 
6128,the piston wont respond
6129,if anyone touches our design  im gonna beat   10  out of them
6130,Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
6131, 2   36 
6132,mass equals to  3   48 
6133,hbu ? 
6134,So for my part  the factorofsafety are always very high  so I would be lowing the mass  if your part has low factorofsafety please don t hesitate to increase mass
6135,they ve been awfullly quiet
6136,good good  Lets keep it that way
6137,So for my part  the factorofsafety are always very high  so I would be lowing the mass  if your part has low factorofsafety please don t hesitate to increase mass
6138,So for my part  the factorofsafety are always very high  so I would be lowing the mass  if your part has low factorofsafety please don t hesitate to increase mass
6139,me too
6140,So for my part  the factorofsafety are always very high  so I would be lowing the mass  if your part has low factorofsafety please don t hesitate to increase mass
6141,but then
6142,im at  2   36 
6143, 
6144,for factorofsafety
6145,They just told me their factorofsafety is very high
6146,hi
6147,how do i know it wasnt you ?  ? 
6148,im at  2   36  for factorofsafety
6149,I ll try lowering my mass some
6150,whut is your name
6151,since we have five members  and the excellent mass is  2   then let s first pick a mass value around  0   4  together
6152,using r 2  equals to    5  r 3  equals to   2 
6153,since we have five members  and the excellent mass is  2   then let s first pick a mass value around  0   4  together
6154, 2   36 
6155,since we have five members  and the excellent mass is  2   then let s first pick a mass value around  0   4  together
6156,since we have five members  and the excellent mass is  2   then let s first pick a mass value around  0   4  together
6157,whats it to u
6158,factorofsafety  equals to   2   36 
6159,The only way i can get higher factorofsafety is if piston diameter pistonborediameter is  43  is lower
6160,hmm 
6161,the   20  we just won
6162,good point
6163,OK
6164,but stil mass equals to  3   48 
6165,ur not wrong
6166,I got  2   36 
6167,crankshaft a lil suspicious too
6168,agreed but isnt the factor of safety shown above that of the part with the lowest factorofsafety ? 
6169, 43  or lower for factorofsafety greater than  2 
6170,I have pistonborediameter at  40 
6171,ok  
6172,nah man he chill
6173,im chatting him up lol
6174,i kinda wanna know who the other people are
6175,for mass equals to  3   48 
6176,let s just determine the weight first
6177,should i ask their names
6178,Our factorofsafety just dropped again
6179,aight aight haha
6180,then we will see how the factorofsafety changes
6181,piston thinks youre suspicious 
6182,do ti
6183,Our factorofsafety just dropped again
6184,but i backed you up
6185,i gotchu
6186,Our factorofsafety just dropped again
6187,Our factorofsafety just dropped again
6188,okay you ask piston guy
6189,mass  equals to   0   05  and factorofsafety  equals to  2   03 
6190,mass  equals to   0   05  and factorofsafety  equals to  2   03 
6191,great factorofsafety right now
6192,mass  equals to   0   05  and factorofsafety  equals to  2   03 
6193,great factorofsafety right now
6194,mass  equals to   0   05  and factorofsafety  equals to  2   03 
6195,great factorofsafety right now
6196,try and lower that mass
6197,great factorofsafety right now
6198,Will making the bore diameter smaller improve your factorofsafety ? 
6199,That sounds ideal to me
6200,we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
6201,where u at
6202,im not surprised he has a pretty big head
6203,is bore diameter piston diameter
6204,i am at my lowest
6205,whats your name fam ? 
6206,we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible
6207, piston head 
6208,damn  same here
6209, ;  
6210,hah punnnnnnny
6211,I am at my lowest
6212,Mine is at  2   36 
6213,What is your factorofsafety ? 
6214,what are your current values for mass and factorofsafety ? 
6215,we just need to lower our mass
6216,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6217,against one of the walls
6218, 1   15 
6219,left side when walking in
6220,could you make it larger ? 
6221,we need to lower our mass
6222,crankshaft is right next to me too lol
6223,we need to lower our mass
6224,Around  2  would be ideal
6225, ? 
6226,yeah I think since the piston pin weighs so little  what you have is good
6227,AMAZING factorofsafety
6228,im at  2  rn
6229,mine are  1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  
6230,AMAZING factorofsafety
6231,ok so do you know why our mass is so high
6232, suspiciously looks around room 
6233,I think you should try to lower your diameter to  45  or so and see what happens 
6234,AMAZING factorofsafety
6235,AMAZING factorofsafety
6236,what up
6237,tell him to sneeze
6238, and gets called out for it 
6239,okay  what s your weight ? 
6240, 3   95 
6241,lmao both of them ? 
6242,yet the mass the horrible lol
6243,My sheet says piston bore diameter but it s not a variable that I control 
6244,yeah haha
6245,we were at  3   5  mass and  1   5  factorofsafety but now it is worse
6246,the dream team
6247,For just the flywheel ? 
6248,the one guy did not respond to my message
6249,fake
6250,no  20  for him
6251,Easy   20   : pistonborediameter
6252,I tihnk its the same thing
6253,I am having it at  40 
6254,we just bumped up top fair
6255,current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive
6256,so yes smaller piston diameter improves my factorofsafety
6257,does yours say that too ? 
6258,current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive
6259,tell him to reply or ur changing ur value
6260,lets play tic tac toe  give me a sec 
6261,wait which two is it ?  the two directly behind us ?  or the one sitting like further right ? 
6262,i was  2   01  OFS for a sec with a high mass
6263,whenever I lower my factor of safety it seems to be having a large effect on the overall value for just a small change in mass
6264, _ I _ I _ 
6265,lmaaaooooo
6266,blackmail
6267,I mass talking to fly wheel about it
6268,Whats up
6269,ok
6270,it was onlt for a sec
6271, _ IXI _ 
6272,yep
6273,only  
6274, _ I _ I _ 
6275,whats your mass ? 
6276,current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive
6277,current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive
6278,current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive
6279,Ok  our factorofsafety is good now  so I think we should keep it there  Now  we need to find a way to reduce mass 
6280, 0   91 
6281,now it dropped
6282,If you need to increase up to  42  thats possible
6283,idk whos changing stuff
6284,what is your mass currently ? 
6285,if you increase though that increases mass
6286, _   _  o  _  X  _   _   _   _ 
6287,so probably not ideal right ? 
6288,do it
6289, _   _  o
6290,i wonder if they read these as part of the study 
6291,mass equals to   3   46  factorofsafety equals to  0   3 
6292, _  X  _ 
6293,It s not me
6294,are the other people responding
6295,probably
6296,Do you know why the mass is so high ? 
6297, :  
6298, _   _   _ 
6299,i believe at least one member s part is too heavy
6300,cause i havent been changing my stuff and its fluctuating
6301, 2   77 
6302,X  _  o
6303,what is the range of masses you can select ? 
6304,Piston-pin seems solid
6305, _ IXI _ 
6306, _ I _ I _ 
6307,X  _  O
6308,wait i wonder if the third guy is against the wall too
6309, _  X  _ 
6310,Connecting rod says they are at factorofsafety  equals to   2   77 
6311,Anything ? 
6312,what s your factorofsafety
6313, _   _  O
6314,yeahh idk where they r at
6315, 0   86 
6316,what s your factorofsafety
6317,but imma find em
6318,XI _ IO
6319, 3   05 
6320, _ IXIX
6321,what s your factorofsafety
6322, _ I _ IO
6323, 1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  
6324,also just realized that you and i are gonna have to figure out the quiz alone bc anisah left
6325,X  _  O
6326,It just looks like the factorofsafety went down a lot
6327,i played with a few settings though so the dims i sent earlier are obsolete
6328,The diameter is now at  40  
6329,O X X
6330,those are my values and ranges
6331,yeahh i realized that when she got up
6332, _   _  O
6333,tbh i think it might be flywheel
6334,thats an L
6335,XIXIO
6336,The crankshaft has factorofsafety  equals to   3   05  and mass  equals to   1   33  and that s about the lowest mass I can get with factorofsafety  greater than   2 
6337,Ok my factorofsafety is  2   03  with mass -  0   05 
6338, 2   77  for a diameter of  40 
6339,O X X
6340, ERROR 
6341,cats game
6342,if we all go for similar factorofsafety at around  3  we should be able to get global factorofsafety as  3  right ? 
6343, _   _  O
6344,ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed
6345,piston pin and flywheel are a little quiet and might not be interacting
6346,doesnt have to be  ;  
6347, 0   02 - 0   12 
6348,it needs to be just above  2 
6349,if im not stupid
6350,me as i finish this semester 
6351,not that high
6352,ok sweet
6353,there ya go
6354,as long factorofsafety isnt below  2  keep it
6355,X X O
6356,We only need factorofsafety of  2  to get excellent
6357,what is the range for your mass values ? 
6358,I know  but the weight is higher for my other options above  2 
6359,O X X
6360,What s your factorofsafety given the crankshaft bearing offset that the crankshaft has ? 
6361, 0   28 
6362,I see
6363, _  O O
6364,gg
6365,close game
6366,whats the lowest highest mass and factorofsafety for you
6367,but  1   33  isnt bad
6368,okay
6369,almost had ya
6370,ya
6371,my turn
6372,and mine is  0   05 
6373,whats your factorofsafety at for current settings
6374,what numbers are u running
6375,piston is 0   91 
6376, 0   1 - 3   24 
6377,mines at  3   84 
6378,yeah ive kinda just given up
6379, 20   86 
6380, _   _   _   ;   _  O  _   ;   _   _   _ 
6381,did u ever get ur  375  exam back
6382,whats your factorofsafety at
6383,Okay  do you know who is making the factorofsafety so low ? 
6384, 0   63  mass
6385,and mass ? 
6386,Is there any way you can lower your weight ? 
6387,I think you have the lowest factorofsafety among all of us
6388,oh nice
6389,ok
6390,X  _   _   ;   _  O  _   ;   _   _   _ 
6391,lol ya slight L but were still hanging on
6392,i think i need to change then
6393,can you increase it to around  2  or  3 
6394,What is your factorofsafety ? 
6395,nice nice
6396,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6397,i got barely any points on the third problem
6398,we can
6399,i might be heavy but i can only do down in mass slightly
6400,i refuse to go back to those lectures so im just gonna wait
6401,I do not
6402,im assuming these are horizontal
6403,Our factorofsafety just got very low  Any idea which part it is ? 
6404,yeahh i think thats what happened to most people
6405,Try lowering your weight
6406,yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back
6407, 3 pistonborediameter spac
6408,Alright  I will try to figure that out
6409,space
6410,without going above pistonborediameter  equals to   42 
6411,It was up and then it went down for some reason
6412,I think flywheel has the lowest factorofsafety
6413,I think your part is ok to be heavier
6414, 1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  
6415,at least it s the largest part in the system lol 
6416,piston says flywheel is lowest factorofsafety
6417,thats the only reason i knew how to do hw prob 3 
6418,yeah it s not that simple
6419,FLYHWEEL
6420,hahaha
6421,Not piston pin  not crankshaft  not you  So either flywheel or piston
6422,i see
6423,but it s better
6424,okay
6425,LOWER YOUR factorofsafety
6426, i think 
6427,now 3   05 
6428,X  _   _   ;   _  O  _   ;   _  O  _ 
6429,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6430, 2   77 
6431,with pistonborediameter equals to  41 
6432,ok make sure your factorofsafety is never below  2 
6433,woah wait we mightve just done something
6434,all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
6435,our value is really good right now
6436,we should always report current factorofsafety
6437,I MEAN INCREASE
6438,yeah agreed
6439,X X  _   ;   _  O  _   ;   _  O  _ 
6440,i was kidding about  3 pistonborediameter
6441,mines at  2   27 
6442,we should always report current factorofsafety
6443,lmao ya i noticed
6444,we should always report current factorofsafety
6445,we should always report current factorofsafety
6446,r 2  equals to  0   5  r 3  equals to  0   5  with pistonborediameter equals to  41 
6447,slim if you can without chaning your factorofsafety
6448,Agreed   3   05 
6449,If you reduce factorofsafety to around  2   can we reduce weight ? 
6450,what mare mass values around an factorofsafety of  2 
6451,I don t think it s piston
6452,but ive decided im gonna focus more on  352  bc its a heavier weighted class
6453,still poor condition
6454,our value is really good right now and the  1   71  and  4   55  are my current values
6455,awesome factorofsafety
6456,slim if you can without changing your factorofsafety
6457,like i kinda dgaf about  375  anymore
6458,good point
6459,retweet
6460,Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety above  2  ? 
6461,were at fair now
6462,X X O  ;   _  O  _   ;   _  O  _ 
6463,X X O  ;   _  O  _   ;  X O  _ 
6464,slim if you can without altering your factorofsafety at all
6465,mass and factorofsafety for you ? 
6466,Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety  greater than   2  ? 
6467,mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
6468,X X O  ;  O O  _   ;  X O  _ 
6469,X X O  ;  O O X  ;  X O  _ 
6470,my factorofsafety is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest mass
6471,mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
6472,mass equals to  4   28  factorofsafety equals to  3   05 
6473,mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
6474,ok
6475,mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 
6476,like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
6477,The current weight of my part is  0   1   so changing it won t affect it a whole lot 
6478,X X O  ;  O O X  ;  X O O
6479,It s all good now  Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety  greater than  2   ? 
6480,this looks like some weird morse code
6481,yeah im pretty confident mine is not gonna work
6482,does urs go straight
6483,yep
6484,really ? 
6485,no lol
6486,its good now just mass to worry about
6487,Ok I think you are solid then
6488,oh ok yeah neither can mine haha
6489,I think flywheel is where our problems are
6490,im at bearingoffset is  90 
6491,my friend offered to help tho so we may be able to fix ours
6492,i have  2   0  so I have the lowest factorofsafety
6493,know whats our next challenge
6494,my factorofsafety is  2 
6495,connect  4 
6496,Yea flywheel is the problem
6497,i have  2   0  so I have the lowest factorofsafety
6498, 7 X 7  fun
6499,i have  2   0  so I have the lowest factorofsafety
6500,nice
6501,what are your ranges ? 
6502,that doesn t make sense  you said your mass was  3   46  ? 
6503,my mass is  3   57 
6504,i have  2   0  so I have the lowest factorofsafety
6505, 20  questions
6506,report weight
6507,im also at  2  rn
6508,that massive dip did not come from piston
6509,did u get the light sensor working
6510,ill choose a word
6511,what is your factorofsafety rn ? 
6512,the other thing is that i think heya is trying to get me and anisah to join her team so idk how this is gonna work out
6513, 20   86 
6514,we havent added it yet
6515,that massive dip did not come from piston
6516,that massive dip did not come from piston
6517,that massive dip did not come from piston
6518,ok got one
6519,ans  0   63  mass
6520,neither have we
6521,we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
6522,yea it was perfect a minute ago
6523, sidenote :  this experiment is probably just recording what we do after we solve the problem
6524,my value has been the same as well thanks for the update
6525,it still doesnt
6526,oh for sure
6527,ours just does donuts as of rn
6528,i hope they read all this
6529,like our robot is handicapped
6530,ok your numbers seem ok idk where this low factorofsafety came from it was just good 
6531,everyone try to lower the factorofsafety to  2  but above  2 
6532,everyone try to lower the factorofsafety to  2  but above  2 
6533,mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft
6534,what is the category ? 
6535,everyone try to lower the factorofsafety to  2  but above  2 
6536,Do you know whats up
6537,everyone try to lower the factorofsafety to  2  but above  2 
6538,nor crankshaft
6539,our value was really good did you make a change a second ago ? 
6540,keep factorofsafety around  2  never below
6541,weight is  0   86 
6542,nor crankshaft
6543,object ?  i dont know the options for categories lol
6544,did you make a change ? 
6545,My weight is around  0   1  so I can t change it much ? 
6546,its helpful to get the ball rolling
6547,one minute ago factorofsafety is amazing yet now lol it s so bad
6548,piston-pin ? 
6549,what offset are you using
6550,anyways ya ive given up on  375  but imma hang out in Hess s office starting next week
6551,barely communicating
6552, 60 
6553,ik lol
6554,q 1  :  is it smaller than a microwave ? 
6555,nope
6556,Hello my friend
6557, greater than  :  
6558,what are your values
6559,q 2  :  is is smaller than a refridgerator
6560,yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
6561,maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low 
6562,yes
6563,nope
6564,are you chaning values and updating your broadcast ? 
6565,maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low 
6566,the final isnt cumulative tho
6567,q 3  :  does it hav emoving parts
6568,maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low 
6569, moving
6570,maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low 
6571,so thats nice
6572,indeed
6573,mine is only mass dependent as factorofsafety is very high
6574,acceptable weight now
6575,yeah i think she ll maybe even drop some hints about the exam 
6576,Someone is below  2 
6577,for some reason i cant go that low
6578,Flywheel prob
6579,and ya no its not which is nice
6580,think low factorofsafety is from piston pin
6581, 80  worked good for me
6582,q 4  :  did we talk about it in our classes this semester ? 
6583,possibly  as in yes 
6584,what is your factorofsafety
6585,what is your factorofsafety ? 
6586,q 5  :  is it a windshield wiper
6587,Our factorofsafety dipped again
6588,LOL NO
6589,I agree but they won t respond to my messages
6590,yeah shes definitely like one of the best lecturers in ME
6591,make it higher
6592,ready ? 
6593,yeah i think his factorofsafety usually gets  0   05 
6594,I am designing the piston  i control the piston diameter and head thickness 
6595,I am designing the piston  i control the piston diameter and head thickness 
6596,I am designing the piston  i control the piston diameter and head thickness 
6597,I am designing the piston  i control the piston diameter and head thickness 
6598,What value do you intend to use for your crank-shaft offset ? 
6599,Also  what is optimal in terms of parameters for you ? 
6600,What is the piston bore diameter ? 
6601,What Bore diameter are you thinking about using ? 
6602, 80 mm
6603,I need to know the piston bore diameter from you
6604,Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system ? 
6605,Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system ? 
6606,Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system ? 
6607,No
6608,Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
6609,Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
6610,flywheel thickness and flywheel shaft diameter
6611,Piston Bore I am currently working with is  55 mm
6612,No
6613,does that work well for you ? 
6614,What is the current value of the bore ? 
6615,No
6616,Piston Bore I am currently working with is  55 mm
6617,Do you have any that depend on the piston pin ? 
6618,Nope
6619,Are you in charge of choosing the piston bore diameter ? 
6620,does that work well for your subsystem ? 
6621,Does a larger thickness negatively affect factorofsafety or mass ? 
6622,im not sure yet
6623,OK  Keep me posted
6624,no  that gives me an factorofsafety of  0   51   My mass is at most  0   12  so there s not much to be gained for reducing it but factorofsafety drops quickly
6625,Let me know what piston bore diameters are working for you  I will need to update my dimensions 
6626,If you can make the bore Diameter  40  then I can get an factorofsafety of  3   44 
6627,Hey  is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest factorofsafety and broadcast it ? 
6628,Hey  is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest factorofsafety and broadcast it ? 
6629,Hey  is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest factorofsafety and broadcast it ? 
6630,Hi  I mass working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design ? 
6631,Ok  I will make adjustments
6632,Let me know what flywheel thicknesses and flywheel shaft diamters are working for you  I will need to update my dimensions 
6633,yes I am
6634,I will be using  40 mm going forward
6635,Ok
6636,What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter ? 
6637,Hey  I mass changing the piston diameter and the piston head thickness  What parameters are you changing ? 
6638,Thanks  If  40 mm doesn t work let s see if we can meet in the middle somewhere
6639,what crankshaft offset is ideal for your design ?  I need it to design the flywheel
6640,For the  4  simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being  1  :  ms :   21   88    2  :  ms :   30   51    3  :  ms :   49   03  ? 
6641,pistonborediameter  equals to   90 
6642,pistonborediameter  equals to   90 
6643,OK
6644,thickness  equals to   8 
6645, 100 
6646,Yeah one sec
6647,what are you currently using for pistonborediameter ? 
6648,thickness  equals to   8 
6649, 40  mm works fine for me  factorofsafety of  4   71  and mass of  0   76   I will continue to iterate 
6650,pistonborediameter  equals to   90 
6651,piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
6652,t  equals to   8 
6653,pistonborediameter  equals to   90 
6654,t  equals to   8 
6655,also input piston bore diameter in mm
6656,Right now I am using  5 mm
6657,The bearing support off set that is ideal for me is  40 
6658,I did it do you see it ? 
6659,Alright  thank you  That is the highest factorofsafety I have found
6660, 5 mm currently
6661,Thanks
6662,yep  we need to lower the overall mass
6663,do you have a diameter that you feel comfortable working with ? 
6664,I need to know your crankshaft bearing offset value so tell me if you find anything good
6665,sorry  50  mm
6666,any suggestions ? 
6667,I apologize pistonborediameter  equals to   80 
6668, 50 mm 
6669,All I need is the diameter
6670,on my screen it says your limit is between  150  and  300  ? 
6671,Awesome  Thanks
6672,pistonborediameter  equals to   80   mistyped
6673,Thank you  Will you please update me if it changes by more than  5  ? 
6674,for bearingoffset
6675,I think we should aim to increase factorofsafety in everyones system
6676,pistonborediameter  equals to   80  not  90 
6677,As of right now  I mass comfortable around  85  for my diameter  but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass
6678,sure
6679,sorry
6680,I think we should aim to increase factorofsafety in everyones system
6681,I think we should aim to increase factorofsafety in everyones system
6682,Are you still going with a crankshaft of  80  ? 
6683,I think we should aim to increase factorofsafety in everyones system
6684,What parameters can you change
6685,oops  wrong value  my bad
6686, 150 
6687,Ok  don t think that s relevant for me
6688,i mistyped pistonborediameter  equals to   80 
6689,crankshaft offset 
6690,got it  thanks
6691,do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin ? 
6692,totally unsure what  4  simulations you mean
6693,Thanks
6694,I have good for a design with thickness  10  and diameter  25 
6695,sweet thanks - let me know when you do
6696,no worries
6697,Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin ? 
6698,What is the offset that is working well for you ? 
6699,No
6700,Our mass is too high right now
6701,w
6702,Currently my factorofsafety is  3   44 
6703,Perfect  I can play around with that  Let me know if anything changes
6704,yes  do you need that changed ? 
6705,thickness  ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
6706,Optimize factorofsafety first then mass ? 
6707,Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod ? 
6708,Im sticking to a small mass bc right now we are heavier than allowed
6709, 170  is working for me
6710,bore diameter
6711,Our factorofsafety is going up and mass is going down  but we still need both to change
6712,no
6713,do you need to know flywheel parameters for your design ? 
6714,pistonborediameter is the diameter of the piston  and T is the thickness of the head
6715,Should have gone through ?  bearingoffset equals to   150   dc equals to  50 
6716,I mass seeing a system wide factorofsafety of  0   5 
6717,What s your flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel ? 
6718,Ok  right now my r 2  is  0   5  and r 3  is  0   2   Is that what you need ? 
6719,Piston bore diameter ? 
6720,I mass testing to see how a crankshaft offset affects my factorofsafety and mass  first
6721,I will update you soon
6722,I mass seeing  1   75 
6723,Do you need info from me
6724,Sounds Good  I am currently at factorofsafety  equals to   2   85 
6725,Do you need info from me
6726,Do you need info from me
6727,so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high factorofsafety
6728, 100  as initial experiment
6729,I am working with  70  right now  but it will need adjusted 
6730,nope 
6731,Has yours updated yet ? 
6732,okay sweet
6733,Amazing
6734,I do not think so  you need anything from me ? 
6735,yeet
6736,Oh yeah
6737,let me know what you think crank bearing offset  bearingoffset  will be
6738,Cool
6739,same i have a minimized mass currently and stall a  3  factorofsafety
6740,Do you need anything from me ? 
6741,Nope
6742,We are good on factorofsafety  but we need to lower our mass 
6743,nope  do you need info from me ? 
6744,We are good on factorofsafety  but we need to lower our mass 
6745,We are good on factorofsafety  but we need to lower our mass 
6746,Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction 
6747,looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain factorofsafety
6748,ok i will lessen the thickness 
6749,are you the conrod designer
6750,Alright thanks
6751,Nope  only need one thing from the piston
6752,Nope  only need one thing from the piston
6753,If we could lower the offset  that would optimize my factorofsafety
6754,It s connecting rod Casey geez
6755,Need anything from me ? 
6756,yeet
6757,What are your current parameters ? 
6758,Need anything from me ? 
6759,Need anything from me ? 
6760,nope 
6761,Nope
6762,looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain factorofsafety
6763,do you need anything from me ? 
6764,I think that will be the crankshaft 
6765,nevermind i am at the minimum thickness setting
6766,what values are you using for the input poston bore diameter ? 
6767,I will change to  70 
6768,truuu
6769,I don t think so
6770,nope
6771,Yea  I am working with my numbers to try and fix that 
6772,our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
6773,okay
6774,Im at diameter  equals to   52   5  and thickness  equals to   35 
6775,okay
6776,what is you flywheel thickness ? 
6777,okay change the other things too
6778,looks like I picked a whole bouquet of oopsy daisies
6779,Are you still running with diameter of  40 
6780, ? 
6781, 80  as the current design
6782,my mass is less than  2   who has the biggest contribution ? 
6783,I ll ask them
6784,got it  thanks
6785,I change the diameter to  80  
6786,flywheelthickness  equals to   22  and flywheeldiameter  equals to   49 
6787,Yes  My current design has a mass of  0   53  and a factorofsafety of  2   1 
6788,let me know what you think crank bearing offset  bearingoffset  will be
6789,my mass  equals to   6   im guessing connecting rod ? 
6790,Thank you
6791,I change it to  80  now
6792,Hi  I mass working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design ? 
6793,or crankshaft
6794,Hi  I mass working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design ? 
6795,Hi  I mass working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design ? 
6796, conrod
6797,what is the mass of your design ? 
6798,we need to get this puppy down
6799,What is the mass of your components ? 
6800,lol
6801,thickness  ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
6802,Our factorofsafety just dropped a ton
6803,has the bore diameter updated ? 
6804,bark
6805,whats your mass ? 
6806, 25  mm
6807, 0   53  is the mass of my piston currently
6808,Do you know how bearingoffset affects your factorofsafety
6809,whats your mass ? 
6810, ? 
6811,what is the mass of your system ? 
6812,Cool
6813,Okay no longer good on factorofsafety
6814,we need to decrease it a bit
6815,How are we looking with factorofsafety ?  Im at  4   09 
6816,My parameters are thickness  ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter  If you feel this directly applies to your design let me know 
6817,Need to increase factorofsafety
6818,My parameters are thickness  ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter  If you feel this directly applies to your design let me know 
6819,right now it s  11   09 
6820,flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter 
6821,How are we looking with factorofsafety ? 
6822,I cannot bring that down too much farther as factorofsafety is at  2   1 
6823,what is the mass of your system ? 
6824,Yeah  I have not changed anything since my parameters were at the bounds of what I could input so I ll reach out to the other folks about it
6825,oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
6826,whats your mass at the moment
6827,Currently is  21   49  for me  factorofsafety is  1   74 
6828,ok
6829,Im at  4   09 
6830,oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
6831, 0   55 
6832,oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
6833,Can you increase your diameter ? 
6834,oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
6835,What is your mass ? 
6836,ooooo it went down but so did factorofsafety
6837,How is your design coming along  do you need any data from me ? 
6838,What is your mass ? 
6839,its  4821   91 
6840,I mass good  thanks
6841,I have bearingoffset and dc what do you control ? 
6842,currently  0   06 
6843,havent figured out the lowest yet but it should be around  1   15 
6844,Ok  trying to figure out who s part weighs the most rn
6845,Do you need any dimensions from me ? 
6846,No  it should still be at  40 mm
6847,Mine are flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter 
6848,Do you need any dimensions from me ? 
6849, 2   26 
6850,Great - let me know if you need anything from me
6851,And the mass for my component is  0   55 
6852, 0   06 
6853,rying to figure out who s part weighs the most rn
6854,Mine is at  2   55 
6855,what is your bore diameter ? 
6856,Ok
6857,Yeah  what s your system mass atm ? 
6858,Ok thank you 
6859,nope  thanks 
6860,yeah  i dont think i can change diameter because it will affect everyone
6861,no  25  is the highest it goes 
6862,Oops  my thickness is  10  mm
6863,ok mine are bearingoffset and dc will look into those
6864, 6   61 
6865,I just updated my broadcast  I found good values that work  but I can iterate mine if need be  Just let me know 
6866,You have a lot of parameters to change  so try and run as many simulations as possible to try and find the sweet spot of mass and factorofsafety
6867,bore diameter is  40 mm
6868,I just updated my broadcast  I found good values that work  but I can iterate mine if need be  Just let me know 
6869,I am updating my pin now to get a factorofsafety of about  2   1  and reduce the mass
6870,What are you using as your diameter
6871,just as a reference
6872,literally dead lol - try to increase factorofsafety
6873,ok looks like you have the biggest   of mass in our system
6874,With t  10  pistonborediameter  25  and bearingoffset equals to  70  the output is ms equals to  0   55  and factorofsafety equals to  4821   91 
6875,okay so my factorofsafety is over  2000  for any design parameters and the mass is less than  2  so I can t figure out how my design affects everyone
6876,Do you need to increase it ? 
6877,What s the mass that you are using ? 
6878,got it
6879,Hi what is the mass that you are currently using ? 
6880,we need mass down a bit
6881,Whats your factorofsafety ? 
6882,My mass is  0   87 
6883,okie
6884,I currently have it at the lowest   150  am trying to run simulation to see how it affects the output values
6885,Ok  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 
6886,I mass guessing the crankshaft  the piston is   55  and the piston pin is  0   06 
6887,right now  I am at  20 
6888,And also the factorofsafety ? 
6889,how about factorofsafety ? 
6890,What s your max mass ? 
6891,Bore diameter according to the piston is  40  mm
6892,now im using diameter  equals to   55  thickness  15 
6893,hmm ok  
6894, 8   67 
6895,what s your max mass ? 
6896,mass is   13  and factorofsafety is  3   1 
6897,What is your piston bore diameter ? 
6898,We need to work on factorofsafety  Is it just an average of all the factor of safetys ? 
6899,But factorofsafety is too low
6900,What is your factorofsafety ? 
6901,ok the lower you have it the higher my factorofsafety
6902,We re going in the wrong direction for both
6903,Yea I believe so 
6904,Looks good  I am at  2   03  and  0   05   equals to  mass
6905,were in good range rn
6906,I also have that dimension
6907,were in good range rn
6908,What is your factorofsafety ? 
6909,have you considered using  75  ? 
6910,were in good range rn
6911,were in good range rn
6912,so someone is a little confused
6913,TRUE
6914,okay now we re better lol - idk what happened
6915,Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 
6916,mines at  3 
6917,Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 
6918,Yeah
6919,Yeah  that was weird haha
6920,Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 
6921,What is the lower range of your weight range
6922,Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 
6923,and our average is really low
6924,what bearingoffset value do you currently have ? 
6925,currenty  2   03   but that can be raised 
6926, 61   91 
6927,alright thanks 
6928,i was using the max but am running simulations for a smaller value currently
6929,nice
6930,What is the lower limit of your weight range ? 
6931,Mine is at  4   55 
6932,Awesome  thanks 
6933,so lmk if it stays at  150 
6934,thanks 
6935,I don t think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from  40  to  70 
6936,Piston diameter still  90  ? 
6937,for the last simulation it is  43 
6938,can you broadcaset  150  ? 
6939,what is bearingoffset ? 
6940,Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values
6941,Ok I was at bearing support offset of  150  and crank-pin diameter of  43   8 
6942,ooo nice
6943,My dimension ? 
6944,try working more with factorofsafety if you can  Ours is so low
6945,It is
6946, 1   64 
6947,What is your range for diameter ? 
6948,Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values
6949,is your maz  105  mm ? 
6950,Which gives lowest weight
6951,That s good
6952,The input crank-shaft bearing support offset
6953, 1   64 
6954, max
6955,sheesh that s high  have you found a good sweet spot between mass and factorofsafety ? 
6956,What is your range for diameter ? 
6957,okay okay
6958,What is your range for diameter ? 
6959,ok that was what I was seeing as well
6960,perfect
6961,Yup 
6962,Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my value
6963,What s your system mass and factorofsafety ? 
6964,What s your system mass and factorofsafety ? 
6965,Could yo uoptimize your factorofsafety ?  I think your weight is mainly negligible
6966,weight is an output for me  The lowest weight I can get with a passable factor of safety at the current bore is  0   53 
6967,What s your system factorofsafety ? 
6968,Your old values gave a higher mass with same factorofsafety  but not sure how it affects other stuff
6969, 40 - 70  mm
6970,yes
6971, 40 - 70 
6972,yea it is
6973,holy cow someone is making major changes
6974,what is your flywheel shaft diameter ? 
6975,mass  equals to   11   09 
6976,alright 
6977,are you changing your numbers a lot ? 
6978,ok same
6979,factorofsafety  equals to   8   67 
6980,Ok I think ive worked out a good combo as far as mass factorofsafety 
6981,I have it set to max currently  so we may need to both be changing that
6982,what is your current diameter size
6983,diameter is  25  mm
6984,yes 
6985,I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier
6986,Sounds great to me
6987,ok same  what is your current diameter size
6988, 15  to  25 
6989,ms :  1   17  fs :  2   0 
6990,because the overall mass and factorofsafety are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago  now they re horrible lol
6991,Sounds great to me  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 
6992,I could  but in reality the goal is  2   0   I could only go upto  3   44   but it would appear that the factorofsafety issue isn t on my end 
6993,Yea I don t think so either 
6994,I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier
6995,what is the factorofsafety that you have right now ? 
6996,Currently have a simulation at bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  50  flywheeldiameter equals to  40  flywheelthickness equals to  51  pistonborediameter equals to  105  with projected output ms equals to  23   24  and factorofsafety equals to  3   96 
6997,do you need to know any flywheel variables ? 
6998,We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
6999,currently  50 
7000,And the mass ? 
7001,We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
7002,I would double my system weight though 
7003,We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
7004,We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
7005,So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety
7006,piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
7007,piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
7008,So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety
7009, 0   1  and  2   55 
7010,I am also not trying to change the design form here 
7011,So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety
7012,I can try  that is the limit tho
7013,So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety
7014,How much does your part weigh ? 
7015,Are you still using  80  for your diameter ? 
7016,yeah  please do
7017,what happened to our factorofsafety oh geez
7018,thickness is  10  mm
7019,Ok  so bearing offset  150  ? 
7020,Sounds good  Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then
7021,I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it ? 
7022,i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 
7023,What is your pistonborediameter ? 
7024,that puts my mass at  2   43  and factorofsafety at  3   9  with t equals to  10   pistonborediameter equals to  25   and bearingoffset equals to  70   That s not bad for now
7025,do you need any of my variables ? 
7026,Mass is  0   1  right ? 
7027,i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 
7028,makes sense
7029,yep
7030,I haven t changed the broadcast for awhile  it must be someone else
7031,Yeah  I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me 
7032,See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
7033,no - must be someone else I guess ? 
7034,its  80  rn
7035,piston bore diameter
7036,is your design at the lowest possible weight ? 
7037,currently working with them
7038,I got a little better mass results
7039,ok got it
7040,What value are you using for your piston bore diameter ? 
7041,Maybe  not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up
7042,See if you can bump that up
7043,okay perfect
7044,using r 2   equals to   0   7  and r 3   equals to   0   7  at the moment
7045,i think so
7046,Well you ve got the crankshaft  it should be the heaviest
7047,Can you change that to  85  ?  or close to it ?  That s what I have
7048, 80 
7049,what is your crankshaft mass ?  And are you still using  70  for your crankshaft offset ? 
7050,hmm that s weird
7051,I ll try
7052,Diameter of  50 
7053,is the factorofsafety of the design the lowest factorofsafety of any one subsystem ? 
7054,nope 
7055,Our dimensions line up at least
7056,Ok updated broadcast  now we re close
7057,I just dont know why our factorofsafety is so low
7058,neato
7059,though I might switch to  75 
7060,I think we should be good  just don t change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
7061,I asked the other designers and the factorofsafety seems to be fine
7062,Are you changing your broadcast values a lot
7063,whats your mass
7064,im not sure
7065,okay nice
7066,Ok that s what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes
7067,Looks like were close again now
7068,kk
7069,and our mass so high
7070,mass ? 
7071,Awesome  thank you  Are you in control of that diameter ? 
7072,however i can bring it all the way down to  40  and still have a factorofsafety of  2   7 
7073,Nevermind we getting there 
7074,mass ? 
7075,I can broadcast htat
7076,so why is our tital so low ? 
7077,what other parameters do u change ? 
7078,whats your mass ? 
7079,total
7080,piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
7081, 0   13 
7082,I don t control that aspect it affects my value but I don t control it
7083, 2   43  which is a bit high
7084,The factorofsafety range for others is between  2   5  and  4   09 
7085,Heaviest Ms :   3   64  Highest factorofsafety :   6   92 
7086,My part only accounts for only  0   1  so I can t do much for mass
7087,Have you heard from the crankshaft ? 
7088,r 2  and r 3  of the piston pin
7089,what is your mass rn
7090,Great - makes sense  that s my job lol
7091,I don t know 
7092,so I mass thinking the factorofsafety of the system is the lowest factorofsafety of any individual subsystem  can you try to increase factorofsafety ? 
7093,That might not be worth it then
7094,yes
7095,sweet
7096,Okay  thank you
7097, 0   13 
7098,Great - we re getting close  I mass trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values
7099,I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
7100,I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up 
7101,piston is in charge of the diameter
7102,I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
7103,yeah drop that to like  1   5  if you can
7104,What is your current mass at ? 
7105,I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
7106,ok
7107,I feel like we should have one person changing at a time
7108,I see  have you heard from the crankshaft ? 
7109, 0   55 
7110,I Have  Since my part is probably the lightest  I increased my fs
7111,that makes sense
7112,what is your mas and factorofsafety ? 
7113,Im at  12   60  now 
7114,trying to lower mass of  2   43   still using  70 
7115,Yeah me too  just told everyone to calm down a little 3 
7116,first day on the job or something ? 
7117,cool thanks
7118,nice
7119,did your mass just change a ton
7120,mine is  0   1  so idk why our mass is so high
7121,thats a good idea
7122,I think my part and yours are doing fine
7123,Just did  I think that made it heavier
7124,more like first hour
7125,the crankshafts mass is really high
7126,Awesome  thank you
7127,update : 
7128,Same
7129,did you change your mass a lot just now
7130,yeah it s a lot heavier
7131,mass  equals to   9   86 
7132,did you change your mass a lot just now
7133,Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy then
7134,factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 
7135,what is yours ? 
7136,I think my pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
7137,nope mine has been at  1   27 
7138,what is your current mass ? 
7139,maybe try and adjust again to find a balance
7140,Hey  we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier 
7141,lol definitely  i mass keeping my values the same for now and trying to communicate with everyone
7142,oh okok
7143,Right now we need to reduce mass and keep factorofsafety  do u want to also see if anyone can do that so its not a free for all
7144, 0   87 
7145,did u change the mass a lot just now ? 
7146,What parameters affect your part ? 
7147,does your design depend on the crankshaft ? 
7148,yes but i didnt broadcast
7149,yeah im not sure either  trying to find out
7150,Same haha
7151,They asked about my bore and nothing since
7152,Great - thanks
7153,and how so ? 
7154,Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up 
7155,Hey  we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier 
7156,Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up 
7157,because it just skyrocketed
7158,Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up 
7159,no only on piston bore diameter
7160,mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above  2 
7161,Nope  havent changed anything
7162,I think hes at factorofsafety  1   64  and mass of  2   26  but that was a while ago
7163,got it  hmmm
7164,BTW  shaved my mass down a tad  mass  equals to   0   52  now
7165,Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
7166,I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
7167,Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
7168,so for you design a lower bearingoffset is better ?  does dc affect yours at all ? 
7169,It might be the flywheel or crankshaft folks
7170,With my current design  mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   0 
7171,ok change it to  84  and see what happens
7172,yes agreed
7173,I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel
7174,ok
7175,I ve kept my numbers steady for a while
7176,I mass trying to do that as well
7177,Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy  Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
7178,Hows it looking now
7179,I think we should go with  40 
7180,if I change it to  75   will it affect your design
7181,Alrighty - how are your mass and factorofsafety numbers looking
7182,for the diameter
7183,ok
7184,are you still using  40  for the diameter ? 
7185,I think if you minimize the mass  we can work together to get a good factor of safety
7186,how s your factorofsafety looking
7187,Ok
7188,TRUE
7189,What is your third field you fill out to run simulations
7190,yeah me too
7191,What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? 
7192,ok will try some other variations
7193,nice  So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
7194,because if I go with  50   factorofsafety would be too low
7195,What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? 
7196,does your design depend on the flywheel at all ? 
7197,Ok we re good I think
7198,Ok we re good I think
7199,Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not
7200,woo 
7201,Ok we re good I think
7202,Just changed it and it didn t help much
7203,could we go with pistonborediameter equals to  40 
7204,The crankshaft takes up the most amount in terms of mass but is it possible to lower the value any further than  2   43  ? 
7205,Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not
7206,Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not
7207,Not by much  I can find values that work for it quickly
7208,Oh no
7209,Whoever last made change go back  it was very good
7210,okay let s tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
7211,Ok 
7212,I dunno
7213,Whoever last made change go back  it was very good
7214,Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
7215,Whoever last made change go back  it was very good
7216,Whoever last made change go back  it was very good
7217,no have not plugged in any new values
7218,and yea I am broadcasting
7219,yep i got it
7220,Wasn t me
7221,our factorofsafety is so low
7222,Yea  Our dimensions line up  so there may be miscommunication among other members
7223,If you need the offset to be higher let me know 
7224,What can I change to help improve your design ? 
7225,Mass yes
7226,yes
7227,factorofsafety no
7228,I am thanks for letting me know 
7229,the flywheel apparently only has a mass of  1   27 
7230,mass is  3  and factorofsafety is  1   44 
7231,only  bearingoffset  affects my factorofsafety  Butmy factorofsafety is in the range of thousands so I don t think it matters too much 
7232,I can sacrifice some factorofsafety if it will take off a lot of mass
7233,I will ask others
7234,The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
7235,can u up factorofsafety ? 
7236,Perfect 
7237,I Havent updated in awhile so my numbers are ms :   3   64  factorofsafety :  6   92 
7238,Do you depend on any of my variables ? 
7239,so someone is low
7240,definitely try and get your factorofsafety up 
7241,okay one sec
7242,For the diameter  I think we should use  40 
7243,okay
7244,Can you decrease bearingoffset to  60  and see what you get ? 
7245,ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples factorofsafety
7246,Piston diameter
7247,yeah min is  2   77 
7248,The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
7249,I dont no
7250,increase your factorofsafety 
7251,bc for me  if it is  50   I can t get my factorofsafety to go high
7252,The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
7253,mine is at the highest possible value
7254,factorofsafety ? 
7255,yea sure
7256,lowering flywheeldiameter helps with mass
7257,what is your factorofsafety ? 
7258,do you rely on a bearingoffset or a dc ? 
7259,pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset
7260, 1   66 
7261,oh  60  is good
7262,Ok I can do that
7263,What would you like ? 
7264,Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? 
7265,Change it back to  105  because the mass will decrease
7266,I ve got  2  of my own variables
7267,Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? 
7268,Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? 
7269,Mine is in the range of thousands  So i guess I don t have to worry about it ?  only the smallest matters right
7270,What happens when you decrease piston diameter ? 
7271,bearingoffset and pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset
7272,OK
7273, mine
7274,nope
7275,I mass jumping between   0   7   0   7   and   0   7   0   8   for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass
7276,hmm okay i will talk with others
7277,okay we need this factorofsafety to go up
7278,Let me know if you do switch so I can update the broadcast  I found good values
7279,your factorofsafety is in the thousands ?  ?  ?  ? 
7280,Just did
7281,ok
7282,and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter
7283,ok 
7284,right  but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations ?  Do you have one ? 
7285,ok
7286,now its  4   92 
7287,crankshaft bearing offset
7288,i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk
7289,Are you broadcasting  2   77 
7290,Can you do  20  ? 
7291,Ok  Be sure to update the broadcast so everyone knows where we are 
7292,Let s try  75 
7293,yeah u should probs freeze
7294,sure
7295,what factorofsafety are you broadcasting
7296,mass  equals to   0   16   factorofsafety  equals to   4   66 
7297,are you changing your values at all
7298,trying
7299,and mass ? 
7300,yeah I
7301,No one is updating broadcast
7302,Gotcha trying to figure out the dependencies
7303,i shit you not lol 
7304,great thanks
7305,Which factorofsafety are you broadcasting
7306,I mass communicating now
7307,Reduces mass let me see what i can do
7308,thats bonkers
7309,make sure you update the global broadcast
7310,No  because I haven t needed to  I mass mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now 
7311,what s the diameter at this point ? 
7312,Same   40  is the way to go
7313,yes  with a mass of  0   1 
7314,make sure you update the global broadcast
7315,the factorofsafety went up from  4821  to  5625 
7316,I just try  75 
7317,Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75 
7318,our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad
7319,Nope  I have held mine constant since i cant get better than mass :   1   61  and factorofsafety :   1   35 
7320,make sure you update the global broadcast
7321,ok i got factorofsafety  2   02  and mass of  5   82 
7322,to simulate
7323,Is your offset still the same ? 
7324,also which factorofsafety are you broadcasting
7325,and see
7326,what is your factorofsafety now ? 
7327, 5625 
7328,Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot 
7329,Alrighty  Just updated it
7330,what ur factorofsafety
7331, 70 
7332,If the piston diameter is  75   I can get a good mix of mass and fs
7333,does only the lowest person s factorofsafety matter ? 
7334,good stick with that
7335,Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75  to see what happens
7336,whats ur factorofsafety
7337,go for it
7338, 1   35 
7339,We had a very good one at  80  before
7340,Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75 to see what happens
7341,what ur factorofsafety
7342,I have  at least on my screen 
7343,so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? 
7344,what is your factorofsafety
7345,Factor of safety is  5000  ?  ? 
7346,so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? 
7347,I have it low as possible
7348,I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the factorofsafety
7349,What about you ? 
7350, 4   55 
7351,ah  change it back to  80  then ? 
7352,Hello
7353, ? 
7354, 4   55 
7355, 4707 
7356,yeah that s what I thought
7357,oh noooo go back
7358,No  I have two of my own variables
7359,the one that is currently broadcasted is  6   92   Thats the max i can get
7360,no I dont
7361,mass ? 
7362,Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are
7363,I can lower my diameter more if you need it
7364,Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are
7365,Hahaha wow
7366,diameter just updated back to  80 
7367, 17   5  ? 
7368,I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do
7369,OK
7370,great
7371,mass  1   66  factorofsafety  1   64 
7372,Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are
7373,and then my system depends on  3  other variables
7374,weight ? 
7375, 7   98 
7376,dang that factorofsafety is low
7377,it s so bad lol
7378,What affects your mass the most ? 
7379, 3   64 
7380,nope
7381,sounds good
7382, 2   11   I can t really descrease is  my dimensions are at their max min
7383,just did
7384,it s  5625  but my part has a weird factorofsafety
7385,Awesome
7386,what are your numbers
7387, 51  and  1   1 
7388,What are those three ? 
7389,We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting
7390,We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting
7391,Did you broadcast that
7392,My mass is  1   12   factorofsafety is  4707 
7393,We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting
7394,We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting
7395,mass ? 
7396,I mass using   0   7    0   7   at the moment
7397,Ok I think someone is confused
7398,OK
7399,bearingoffset :  150  dc :  50 
7400,I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
7401,hmm
7402,and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter
7403,great - please leave it there
7404,Also  be sure to tell me if the bore diameter changes 
7405, 9   86 
7406,Same here  the total simulation was very good for two seconds and that someone completely messed it up
7407,done 
7408,what is your diameter ? 
7409,and what are your numbers when you do that
7410,I updated to the values that gave me mass  equals to   0   52  and fs  equals to   2   0  and have not since
7411,so for me besides diameter  i can play around with two variables
7412,back at  80 
7413,Diameter is  40  mm
7414,yeah it sucked
7415,one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
7416,I mean factorofsafety and mass
7417,back at 80 
7418,We need an factorofsafety of  2  don t we ?  We are at  1   1 
7419,just got an factorofsafety of  2   03  and mass of  1   01 
7420,ok what about mass ? 
7421,back at  80 
7422,Im sticking with that
7423,these are the same values for the  very good  design
7424,and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
7425,great 
7426,factorofsafety could increase with increase in mass but if it s already so high I don t think it matters  right ? 
7427,back at  80 
7428,ok  I have heard nothing from Crank Design
7429,actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back
7430,Yea our dimensions line up then
7431,I change it back to  80  since the overall results for  75  are not good
7432,actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back
7433,hey try changing the diameter to  90 
7434,actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back
7435,we need to do better though lol
7436,do you have any variable that seems to match with those ? 
7437,Would it be possible for you to increase your factorofsafety ? 
7438,yeah  working on it
7439,Ok  someone changed something and made it much worse
7440,Did they not ask what the bore diameter was ? 
7441,you re going to keep it at  80  ? 
7442,the broadcasted values of  2   31  and  1   4 
7443,I think so
7444,Whichever gets you the highest
7445, 51  and  1   1  my values keep getting messed up
7446,Because they asked me for that
7447,yeah idk what
7448,our mass is already  10 kg too high
7449,OK
7450, 17   5  would be great  lowers mass a ton
7451,well the grade scale shows that a total mass below  2  should be possible
7452,yeah we were over  2  about a minute ago
7453,done
7454,Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with ? 
7455,whats the best factorofsafety you ve had ? 
7456, 0   55 
7457,right  :  
7458,let me know if you need to go any lower
7459,ok i get factorofsafety of  5  and ms of  7 
7460,Cus thats our weak point rn
7461,The crankshaft by far has the most mass
7462,They asked and I gave them  40 mm  I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them  and they have not responded
7463,did you get your mass down ? 
7464,okay  Have you talked to the other subsystems about only changing one subsytem at a time ? 
7465,Did you broadcast anything recently ? 
7466,yes
7467,I haven t changed anything in the last five min
7468,No
7469,please please try and get those sorted out ASAP and let me know if you need anything  look at all your already run simulations and pick out the lowest mass and factorofsafety then set your values to those
7470,What s the updated mass for the crankshaft ? 
7471,Did you broadcast anything recently ? 
7472,  _   ?   _  
7473,are you using my dc dimension ? 
7474,im not sure if everyone is on board 
7475,What are your two variables at
7476,Are you still using  70  for the offset ? 
7477,yeah they say they cant decrease it any more
7478,increase in either variable causes both the mass and factorofsafety to go up
7479,our factorofsafety still needs to go up
7480,Okay I mass using my results for  80 
7481,Ok  I ll ask them if so and then we can go from there  That looks like a hard simulation to run 
7482,still mass  equals to   9   86  and factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 
7483,Interesting  the mass is what is hurting us but the factorofsafety is beautifull
7484,hahah this is rough
7485,i have set it to those values
7486,if u want to adjust urs  u can announce to all chats
7487,Ok cool
7488,crankshaft is  2   11  but they say they cant decrease it anymore
7489,dc ? 
7490,Thanks
7491,i wont move mine again
7492,Now it is  80 
7493,I think it s dependent on the flywheel  crankshaft  and connecting rod values at this point
7494,Yeah  I mass upto  2   62  now  But remember  its the minimum of all the factorofsafety that matters the most 
7495,okay  i havent updated in awhile
7496,I think so
7497,yes
7498,right
7499,Thats fine 
7500,okay  try and get the factorofsafety even higher - we need to at least meet one of these criteria
7501,We are good on mass
7502,Have you broadcasted anything recently ? 
7503,so  currently where are we with factorofsafety ? 
7504,Would going higher help ? 
7505, 12  and  60 
7506,Trying to figure out what caused the spike in weight
7507,by the way  I can get an fs of  10   19  if you go down to  75 
7508, 12  for flywheelthickness and  60  for flywheeldiameter
7509,We need to meet at least one of these criteria
7510,Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? 
7511,so I have two variables
7512,Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? 
7513,That would be my guess too 
7514,Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? 
7515,I am at the time we got the best result now
7516,Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? 
7517,Are you currently changing values ? 
7518,one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
7519,Are you currently changing values ? 
7520,It others peoples dimensions so im trying to figure that out
7521,no
7522,Are you currently changing values ? 
7523,Are you currently changing values ? 
7524, 1   94 
7525,no
7526,I think I have the easiest part lol  No one s asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them
7527,Okay  I played around with it at the beginning and I don t think my factorofsafety has a huge affect on the overall factorofsafety  My mass is only  3   17   and my factorofsafety is at  2   That s where I thought I would keep it for now 
7528,and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
7529,no
7530,nope  haven t broadcasted in a bit  The most I can change the wieght is by like  3  anyways
7531,Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
7532,No
7533,I haven t changed my dimensions for awhile now  hope that helps
7534,Anything else I can help optimse ? 
7535,diameter is  80 
7536,hmmm  okay do u wnat to try that ? 
7537,they have not been changed for the last  10  minutes
7538,what are yous mass factorofsafety
7539,Based on their mass of  1   66   they take up half the weight of the system  So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important 
7540,what is your weight at  75  and what is it at  80  ? 
7541,what are your mass factorofsafety
7542,mass  8   84  factorofsafety  4   39 
7543,Can you change flywheeldiameter to  55  and braodcast
7544,ok that s good
7545, 1   64 
7546,no
7547,did u try everyone else ?  cause our mass is too high
7548,Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there ? 
7549,these are the same values I had for the  very good  design
7550,what are yourmass factorofsafety
7551,I think that is an average of each designer s parts which is why I think someone s dimensions aren
7552,Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values ? 
7553,do you have any variable that seems to relate to them ? 
7554,nice
7555,Ah okay  gotcha
7556,we can both move  i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it
7557,Ok
7558,arent lining up
7559,what are your mass factorofsafety
7560,Will do 
7561,yep trying my best now - we need to meet at least one of the criteria
7562, 5   75     75 
7563,what is your bore diameter now ? 
7564,What does your system factorofsafety value say ?  mine are all like over  4000  even when i minimize mass
7565,no
7566, 6   61   80 
7567,I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 
7568,so t equals to  10  flywheeldiameter equals to  25  ? 
7569,yeah one sec
7570,maybe my part doesn t matter
7571,Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment
7572,Who depends on your variables ? 
7573,The TA guy said its the lowest value between us
7574,Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment
7575,Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment
7576,ya  try  75 
7577,I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 
7578,Still  40 mm  Will increasing bore help your design ? 
7579,What parameters increaes your factorofsafety or mass ? 
7580, 1   3  and mass is too high
7581,ok
7582,I just broadcasted  10    15   and  60 
7583, 44    1   29 
7584,Same
7585,just did it
7586,everyone else has remained the same values
7587,pretty sure no one
7588,ok can u tell everyone that we agreed to move ?  i will also 
7589,I have my values set at t I   equals to   5   667  and r  1    equals to   4  with a factorofsafety of  2   0  and an mass s  of  3   17  using piston bore diameter of  80  
7590,ya  seems like we have agreement on that
7591,I have my values set at t I   equals to   5   667  and r  1    equals to   4  with a factorofsafety of  2   0  and an mass s  of  3   17  using piston bore diameter of  80  
7592,I have my values set at t I   equals to   5   667  and r  1    equals to   4  with a factorofsafety of  2   0  and an mass s  of  3   17  using piston bore diameter of  80  
7593,I have my values set at t I   equals to   5   667  and r  1    equals to   4  with a factorofsafety of  2   0  and an mass s  of  3   17  using piston bore diameter of  80  
7594,it has a low factorofsafety for my part but it doesn t seem like mine really makes a difference
7595,will do
7596,Thanks
7597,just changed diameter to  80  and got factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 
7598,Where is your factorofsafety at ? 
7599,should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall
7600,Where is your factorofsafety at ? 
7601, 1643   92  ? 
7602,what is your factorofsafety ? 
7603,yes  piston bore is  80 
7604,what is your factorofsafety ? 
7605,piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now
7606,piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now
7607,I think the lowest factorofsafety is what is broadcasted
7608,nah  we only have  2  mins left
7609,A factorofsafety of higher than  1000  ? 
7610,piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now
7611,did it affect the overall ? 
7612,impressive
7613,got it
7614,are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness
7615,I don t think that s right
7616,Diameter  equals to   40  mm
7617,gotcha
7618,I don t think it is an average is it ? 
7619,Whats the max factorofsafety you can get ?  without adding too much weight
7620,I mass pretty sure no one depends on my variables though
7621,I asked the guy  he said it was normal
7622,Where is your factorofsafety at ? 
7623,can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? 
7624,Diameter  equals to   40 mm
7625,our mass just went up  20 kg 
7626,You have to update your broadcast and look at the total factorofsafety and mass
7627,our mass just went up  20 kg 
7628, 7   02 
7629, 1   29 
7630,our mass just went up  20 kg 
7631,can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? 
7632,our mass just went up  20 kg 
7633,it would increase my factorofsafety some
7634,can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? 
7635,try changing your other values ? 
7636,But weight is  25 
7637,yep
7638,factorofsafety _ s :   1653   92  ; 
7639,It is updated  That s my current broadcast 
7640,didnt change anything
7641,can you get that factorofsafety up ? 
7642,We re close  guys
7643,yea I am doing that rn
7644,I mean  its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads  So that s normal 
7645,currently  1   64 
7646,that looks good
7647,wait your flywheeldiameter is  15  now ? 
7648,yes   40 
7649,adjust which part ? 
7650,I can try
7651,now it s back  ?  ?  idk
7652,what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? 
7653,now it s back  ?  ?  idk
7654,now it s back  ?  ?  idk
7655,TRUE
7656,now it s back  ?  ?  idk
7657, 2   79 
7658,yeah that is what im using
7659,were they significantly different twenty minutes ago ? 
7660,I can minimize my diameter
7661,Nope
7662,to  15 
7663,Do u depend on the bore diameter ? 
7664,ok never mind then
7665,what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? 
7666,slightly
7667,okay
7668,im at  75 
7669, 3   42 
7670,does it affect your design much ?  If I increase it to  60  it will only increase my mass by like 0   3 
7671,ok
7672,Thanks
7673,connecting rod said their values weren t significantly different twenty minutes ago
7674,connecting rod said their values weren t significantly different twenty minutes ago
7675,My system factorofsafety is  2   05  atm
7676,I ve been at  4  and right around  5   5 - 5   7  for all my broadcasts
7677,Mine neither
7678,no
7679,Sorry I just mine back to  25 
7680,only the crankshaft offset
7681,ok no one anything
7682,uf
7683,ok no one anything
7684,ok no one anything
7685,ok no one anything
7686,increase it to  50 
7687,what about thickness of flywheel ? 
7688,its at  12   lowest
7689,raise it a little like  20
