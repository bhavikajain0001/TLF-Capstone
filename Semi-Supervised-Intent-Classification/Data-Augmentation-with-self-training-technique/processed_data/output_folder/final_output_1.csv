we re probably only trying to keep your factorofsafety going over area 2 right?,Asking_for_information
I dropped my mass by  0   02 ,Providing_information
I chose the smallest values to give smallest weight on my end,Providing_information
the mass was  0   24  with the diameter at  70   but with the diameter at  45  it was  0   17 ,Providing_information
I have mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   44  for pistonborediameter  equals to   40 ,Providing_information
I don t know what has changed  Ill rebroadcast what I had when we were good ,Providing_information
stop changing,Providing_information
thats my boy max,Providing_information
whoever changed please not go back,Asking_for_information
what on s your primary factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
we re back to very good,Providing_information
Range of weights was  1   49  to  4   81   My broadcast uses  1   49  with factorofsafety  equals to   4   55 ,Providing_information
My mass is   30  lbs  but the crankshaft mass is always high  I can set it over  50  by myslef ,Providing_information
min of  40 ,Providing_information
current broadcasted is  25   98   factorofsafety is still over  2 ,Providing_information
How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
just updated my broadcast  Mass of mine is  1   49 ,Providing_information
so the lower pistonborediameter is not the single better it truly is looking for me,Asking_for_information
suppose how great much does your mass range by,Asking_for_information
my mass varies somewhere between around 0 - 0 12 so let me me know if today you need me anymore to adjust anything,Providing_information
have can you not been seriously changing your broadcasted values slightly since we were at excellent?,Asking_for_information
my system is probably not the limiting part,Providing_information
I guess what I mass saying is if you can marginally increase mass to increasing factorofsafety more noticeably  that might be a better compromise,Providing_information
Increasing the offset increases the mass and decreases the factor of safety ,Providing_information
increasing only the offset increases the mass and decreases of the factor number of safety,Providing_information
if i really reduce all my plasma mass transfer by 03 it reduces factorofsafety by 25 to 1 in 76,Providing_information
mine is  3 ,Providing_information
for 1 flywheelthickness ratio equals equal to 10 flywheeldiameter equals sum to 15 ; and mass equals to 0 52 pounds and the factorofsafety reduction equals equals to 1215 12,Providing_information
Hi  I need the piston diameter pistonborediameter,Asking_for_information
ah i menat  1   47 ,Providing_information
can you you cut any more internal mass out and get closer to that factorofsafety where equals to square 2,Asking_for_information
our body design eventually changed to good do you know that what changed?,Asking_for_information
what s your two component range of wheel weights?,Asking_for_information
I broadcasted a change to lower my mass  factorofsafety is still above  2   0   I saw that after this message  so sorry about not telling you before,Providing_information
lower internal pistonborediameter pressure lowers my skin mass and release factorofsafety,Providing_information
then someone just broadcasted out somethhing different sounds and raised our mass to almost 3 25,Providing_information
How much does your mass range by,Asking_for_information
also if desired it s important increasing flywheelthickness increases mass efficiency but generally decreases weight factorofsafety,Providing_information
Who has the factorofsafety of   57  ?  we need to work on increasing that,Asking_for_information
well i am trying too but it lowers my time factorofsafety as yours well so i ll see if i can already do exactly anything furhter,Providing_information
most recent factorofsafety is  3   01 ,Providing_information
like what parameters you chose,Asking_for_information
i also have all mass equals 3 to 0 12 and an factorofsafety weight equals 1 to 3 and 44 for pistonborediameter equals to 40,Providing_information
usually i have aimed mine with the factorofsafety closest to even 2 ghz and lowest possible mass i can get,Providing_information
It increases mass by  0   03  and increases factorofsafety to  5625   56 ,Providing_information
I lowered my mass by about  5  lbs,Providing_information
It is at a  75  though,Providing_information
that range of the weights was 1 of 49 plus to 4 81 my world broadcast guide uses 1 49 with factorofsafety equals 7 to 4 55,Providing_information
like parameters you chose,Asking_for_information
we are at excellent agian,Providing_information
what value are you changing ? ,Asking_for_information
mass  1   49   factorofsafety  2   47 ,Providing_information
was there even a single particular reason why has you even asked about it maxing out flywheeldiameter?,Asking_for_information
45 seems decent lower mass if also we need to effectively reduce mass,Providing_information
i think you have the third biggest weight contribution so if... you can really optimize it a bit better we should both be close,Providing_information
im at a factorofsafety of just over  2   so I think I mass good unless we need to cut more mass,Providing_information
which are bearing support offest and crank-pin diameter respectivly,Providing_information
Not much it doesn t really do anything to the factor of safety but it brings the mass down,Providing_information
just updated my broadcast to the minimum values for both,Providing_information
now hello have you simply determined at what diameter you would like of the largest piston bore diameter pistonborediameter to be?,Asking_for_information
that was s not a pretty high core mass any chamce you can bring and it straight down again and keep factorofsafety just over ph 2?,Providing_information
i mass not the only one who that is actually changing,Providing_information
also  if you click check for broadcast at the top it says we re at excellent,Providing_information
always think how i optimized my smallest part with total mass equals 10 to 52 and factorofsafety factor equals to 2 01,Providing_information
40 works for a me,Providing_information
ah i menat 1 in 47,Providing_information
hey and i also need information to know what piston bore diameter you are planning to directly use for checking my calculations,Asking_for_information
can you see 51 if you able increase your bore in diamater to 41 percent or 42 if just it can improves anything?,Asking_for_information
Have you been changing your broadcasted values since we were at excellent ? ,Asking_for_information
each increasing its bearingoffset increases double the mass bandwidth and decreases the factorofsafety,Providing_information
I decreased my weight parameter a bit,Providing_information
Have you changed the system at all ?  Our quality has dropped ,Asking_for_information
how strongly appreciable why is the exponential change in personal mass consumption if you prioritize against factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
based on bearingoffset  equals to   60  ? ,Asking_for_information
does it help you if I reduce that value at all ? ,Asking_for_information
... if you could reduce your actual flywheelthickness variable that function would not be great :,Providing_information
 7   96  has been the best achieved thus far,Providing_information
we both have excellent quality right now,Providing_information
basically 1 if we can for each day keep our part factor range of safety above 2 while not minimizing mass we ll always be golden,Providing_information
what s your mass greater than ,Asking_for_information
stop the changing,Providing_information
What are your current values ? ,Asking_for_information
the mass was originally 0 24 c with the diameter at 70 but later with the diameter estimate at 45 it was a 0... 17,Providing_information
based on everything my simulations provided it seems like a smaller net value of bearingoffset that will result in an estimated overall increasingly higher profit factorofsafety then do you agree?,Asking_for_information
Right now it says we have an excellent design,Providing_information
But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher,Asking_for_information
my design method depends only on varying the piston diameter what happens if can you decrease it?,Asking_for_information
Was there a particular reason why you asked about maxing out flywheeldiameter ? ,Asking_for_information
o hi flywheel my crankshaft depends on your flywheel diameter shaft diameter in pistonborediameter _ a s and thickness of flywheel t _ f if i don t yet know you how or but it really will would probably be help that you know,Providing_information
i don t think so,Providing_information
I ve just broadcasted the most recent simulation but this will definitely not be the final one ,Providing_information
is your heart mass high?,Asking_for_information
conrod length to thumb crank length ration r equals only to − 3,Providing_information
whats your factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
how great low that can let you go on the piston bore diameter?,Asking_for_information
I asked if they changed their broadcasted values from excellent ,Asking_for_information
I still see that our system s factorofsafety is   68  ?  odd,Asking_for_information
that is precisely what my document specifies a i who will never keep bearingoffset low unless the piston needs bring it up to be higher,Providing_information
for that depends on what the thickness of the piston is for making me... if i keep it to the scale same and so decrease it the total mass goes mostly down but so in does being the factor of safety i mass trying to get it around 2 w lowest mass,Providing_information
yeah  the overall mass went up  so I mass about to raise my mass and drop the factorofsafety one of the other designers asked me to,Providing_information
cool  I havent changed anything from excellent,Providing_information
individually  2   47 ,Providing_information
Hey looks like our factorofsafety went up  What changed ? ,Asking_for_information
... how is appreciable is ever the permanent change in mass if if you prioritize any factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
i mass found working really bad close the the bow flywheel engineer,Providing_information
for my part or total ? ,Asking_for_information
whats it playing at with a 45?,Asking_for_information
not out much it doesn t really do anything to the factor of air safety then but it brings the potential mass loss down,Providing_information
how does the extended piston radius bore diameter affect the overall fuel design parameters?,Asking_for_information
update before the broadcast,Providing_information
Just updated,Providing_information
what is your arm diameter pointing at currently?,Asking_for_information
yeah the overall eye mass deficit went up significantly so i mass about to raise my mass and then drop below the mental factorofsafety one of the other hair designers asked taking me out to,Providing_information
who has had the suggested factorofsafety of 57? but we need to continue work on... increasing that,Asking_for_information
to let me... know if i can adjust my variables to this better suite below your requirements,Asking_for_information
so hi i need the piston ring diameter from pistonborediameter,Asking_for_information
a factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
Let me know if I can adjust my variables to better suite your requirements,Asking_for_information
who s a factorofsafety to changed,Asking_for_information
i have decreased flywheeldiameter dimensions to exactly 15 mm size to conserve some mass gain as my factorofsafety values are all greater for than exactly 300,Providing_information
what s your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
i changed my overall mass to a corresponding lower value and updated it out and it says where the mass level went up,Providing_information
i mass currently at 40 mm diameter lens which usually is giving me better test results out than just the 45 mm,Providing_information
Whats the effect of pistonborediameter on your results ? ,Asking_for_information
what s your component range of weights ? ,Asking_for_information
our mass seems to be going up  are you using the original values ? ,Asking_for_information
our mass seems to just be going up but are you just using for the original values?,Asking_for_information
Yes  I just posted an updated broadcast,Providing_information
Can you cut any more mass out and get closer to factorofsafety  equals to   2 ,Asking_for_information
yeah  the overall mass went up  so I mass about to raise my mass and drop the factorofsafety one of the other designers asked me to,Providing_information
individually number 2 47,Providing_information
mine is mass of 6 to 33 g and minimum factorofsafety of 9 2 23,Providing_information
what s your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
i greatly decreased my weight parameter of a bit,Providing_information
just updated my daily broadcast to show the minimum values for the both,Providing_information
you then ll need to broadcast once that the last most recent broadcast value we have listed is 80,Providing_information
okay alright what factorofsafety s so are you you getting my vote lowest this factorofsafety was situation is still 323,Asking_for_information
does is it help you if would i reduce that value at with all?,Asking_for_information
Rn were under mass so if you need to you could increase it a bit,Providing_information
I mass working really close the the flywheel engineer,Providing_information
 45  seems decent  lower if we need to reduce mass,Providing_information
i chose the very smallest values to further give smallest weight left on my end,Providing_information
right around now though it says we have an excellent design,Providing_information
crankshaft is like hp 30,Providing_information
Its at  2   83  rn for me,Providing_information
and with bearingoffset equals to 60 and 2 dc equals to 20 i you get the factorofsafety number equals to 3 8,Providing_information
finally i think its the piston,Providing_information
i mass leaving for it as 45 at least but for now now,Providing_information
just lowered it another  2  lbs,Providing_information
I re-simulated with the others  updated values and got a slightly lower mass and factorofsafety of  3 ,Providing_information
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Providing_information
not sure that but 0... 03 is not a lot of electron mass,Providing_information
Can you see if you increase your bore diamater to  41  or  42  if it improves anything ? ,Asking_for_information
Same goes for you  Is your factorofsafety above  1   5  ? ,Asking_for_information
yeah okay we re still above a factor of public safety regardless of our 2 thought so and don t worry about it,Providing_information
no i haven t changed anything because my factorofsafety class is 3 96 a and her mass is 30 lb 51 crankshaft is heavy for any given situation,Providing_information
yes currently stated it is based at 2 27,Providing_information
that s a pretty high mass  any chamce you can bring it down and keep factorofsafety just over  2  ? ,Providing_information
what s is your mass greater than,Asking_for_information
I was looking at what factor of safety  weight range is excellent and trying to get the lowest mass with a factor of safety around  2 ,Providing_information
for taking my part or total?,Asking_for_information
... i don t think so,Providing_information
interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Providing_information
that is what i kept uploaded to me while more well consistent my values really did not change though,Providing_information
imagine how much appreciable change is the next change possible in mass if finally you prioritize factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
If you could reduce your  flywheelthickness  variable that would be great  :  ,Providing_information
for which are bearing bearing support offest load and crank - like pin diameter respectivly,Providing_information
is there anyway you could lower the weight and factorofsafety to just above  2 ,Asking_for_information
did you change the diameter because mine says  80   but at  105  it was excellent,Asking_for_information
You probably want to check with the piston,Providing_information
is the factorofsafety highest and mass lowest when the offset is  150  ? ,Asking_for_information
if keeping it at 40 works best for me what exactly about the three others?,Providing_information
hey i am from the conrod ltd i i was rather curious as to what you initially thought a reasonably good piston diameter would be?,Asking_for_information
r 2 equals proportional to 0 2 5 so r 3 3 equals corresponding to 0 2 and at pistonborediameter 3 equals to about 40 this gives mass equals corresponding to 0 12 and a factorofsafety equals to 3 3 44,Providing_information
it appears like our engine design currently is really excellent,Providing_information
?,Asking_for_information
That is what my document specifies  I will keep bearingoffset low unless the piston needs it to be higher,Providing_information
Wanna do me a favor and broadcast the value of  45 ,Asking_for_information
I mass currently at  40  mm diameter  which is giving me better results than the  45  mm,Providing_information
How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
generally my flywheel also partially depends on your radial crankshaft for bearing offset bearingoffset,Providing_information
do its at 2 83 to rn for me,Providing_information
conrod length to crank length ration  r   equals to   3 ,Providing_information
I now have minimum factorofsafety but i further decreased my mass,Providing_information
How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
what are your current values ? ,Asking_for_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   40  works best for me if you can make that work,Providing_information
mass 1 54 49 factorofsafety factor 2 47 47,Providing_information
my personal factorofsafety is  4   55  and my personal parameter selection minimizes mass,Providing_information
stop changing,Providing_information
can then you triple max out with the flywheeldiameter value to see what next happens?,Providing_information
also there if you click check for which broadcast at the top is it says if we re at excellent,Providing_information
then what are your current values?,Asking_for_information
I mass currentlt at factorofsafety of  2   07   so I  not the low,Providing_information
my system is also probably not the true limiting part,Providing_information
nevermind getting back at excellent now,Providing_information
Hello pistonpin  The crankshaft doesn t dep 3 end directly on your system  but please tell me if anything that I do affects you ,Providing_information
I mass leaving it as  45  at least for now,Providing_information
whilst i don doubt t really think that was my ever doing i have been broadcasting factorofsafety the values around the 8,Providing_information
1 ¶ 38,Providing_information
it doesnt affect you my mass because i got mass the pin for designer,Providing_information
since i have now i canchange it then back,Providing_information
what of all directly affects the required piston diameter? what keeping the piston diameter smaller improves both both the pin s mass and factor of safety what different factors drive up on the diameter?,Asking_for_information
the sweet just a little bit more,Providing_information
rn were only under mass so if you need to you i could still increase it a large bit,Providing_information
I chose the smallest values to give smallest weight on my end,Providing_information
Mine is at  1   59  for my most recent broadcast,Providing_information
i haven t changed anything  My factorofsafety is  3   96  and mass is  30   51   crankshaft is heavy for any situation ,Providing_information
but i have both of my values fully optimized,Providing_information
i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Providing_information
just not updated,Providing_information
rn I only see our global factorofsafety as  0   57  and mass as  2   16  ? ,Asking_for_information
not this much,Providing_information
I am trying my hardest  what would your factorofsafety be with that change ?  We only want it to be above  2 ,Asking_for_information
you to re already in charge of the crankshaft bearing forward offset right?,Asking_for_information
so yeah her the entire overall mass went up so i used mass about first to deliberately raise my gross mass cap and drop the factorofsafety until one of the other designers asked me to,Providing_information
they re going to leave it safe  sinc eit doesn taffect weight much,Providing_information
mass  equals to    52   factorofsafety  equals to   2   02 ,Providing_information
besides i really can probably drop some mass out of my large part now but can also take that out of other large parts,Providing_information
i have not,Providing_information
i mean i mass the low exposure factorofsafety rating of 2 000 01 now and can or t really cut any no more on mass,Providing_information
I haven t changed my broadcast,Providing_information
just reduced thread thickness to reduce of mass rate increased factorofsafety to a bit,Providing_information
what mass assembly are you at?,Asking_for_information
therefore i now have minimum gross factorofsafety but i further decrease decreased my gross mass,Providing_information
i don t exactly know the precise lowest factorofsafety on my email screen which is also 0 57,Providing_information
Not much,Providing_information
Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
Range of weights was  1   49  to  4   81   My broadcast uses  1   49  with factorofsafety  equals to   4   55 ,Providing_information
So the lower pistonborediameter is the better it is for me,Asking_for_information
Just updated for pistonborediameter  equals to   40   Im getting factorofsafety of  3   44 ,Providing_information
what way was the flywheel tube thickness used?,Asking_for_information
I don t know what has changed  Ill rebroadcast what I had when we were good ,Providing_information
what is your diameter at currently ? ,Asking_for_information
who has matched the factorofsafety number of 57? do we need to work furiously on so increasing that,Asking_for_information
does changing even any other surface s parameters help not bring your mass down?,Asking_for_information
you think i optimized my part with mass relation equals to 52 and second factorofsafety ratio equals − to 2... 01,Providing_information
Hi flywheel  My crankshaft depends on your flywheel shaft diameter pistonborediameter _ s  and thickness of flywheel t _ f  I don t yet know how  but it will probably help that you know ,Providing_information
it is so 45 mm bore diameter working better then for you? i was already getting about better results at 40,Asking_for_information
What mass are you at ? ,Asking_for_information
pistonborediameter ratio equals to the 40 one works best for me if only you can only make that work,Providing_information
Is  45  mm bore diameter working better for you ?  I was getting better results at  40 ,Asking_for_information
Based on my simulations  it seems like a smaller value of  bearingoffset  will result in an overall higher factorofsafety  do you agree ? ,Asking_for_information
yeah i haven ‚ t changed anything,Providing_information
it depends heavily on maximum piston diameter,Providing_information
Right now I have a total mass of  1   49  and factorofsafety of  4   55  which appears to be good via rubric,Providing_information
what sort seems rather to me be the ideal piston for bore diameter on exiting your back end? or could possibly you explain how it affects mass and factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
7 96 has been the previous best achieved result thus far,Providing_information
crankshaft is like  30 ,Providing_information
Not sure  But  0   03  is not a lot of mass,Providing_information
I am using the best results that I have  where bearingoffset is minimum and pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset is maximum  Inve tried other things but that is my best by far  and is the only solution I have uploaded,Providing_information
your mass is  25   98  ? ,Asking_for_information
can increase diameter is we need higher factorofsafety,Providing_information
i think you have the biggest weight contribution  so if you can optimize a bit we should be close,Providing_information
just updated my broadcast  Mass of mine is  1   49 ,Providing_information
try and totally minimize your mass intake but keep factorofsafety levels above mass 2,Providing_information
if our own current design is excellent i am quite not sure how we... did that but indeed i am happy,Providing_information
i lowered my muscle mass by about 5 ¹⁄₂ lbs,Providing_information
Ok  Do that  That s a big factorofsafety for only a gain of  0   03 ,Providing_information
I do not think it has any effect,Providing_information
how can you put yours back to life before when it never was was excellent? i suddenly think theres still some dependency that makes it go bad,Asking_for_information
... did you change the diameter because the mine says 80 but anyway at 105 metres it was excellent,Asking_for_information
Our current design is excellent  I am not sure how we did that  but I am happy ,Providing_information
we are sitting at excellent agian,Providing_information
my mass limit is further lowered and my factorofsafety is to just above max 2,Providing_information
What all affects the piston diameter ?  Keeping the diameter smaller improves both the pin s mass and factor of safety  What factors drive up the diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
and what are your current values?,Asking_for_information
right now what our factor cost of safety here is chilling around 2 5,Providing_information
i mass not the only one that is changing,Providing_information
My flywheel also depends on your crankshaft bearing offset  bearingoffset ,Providing_information
ok do that that really s a big factorofsafety i for only makes a gain estimate of 0 for 03,Providing_information
and yes i just already posted an updated broadcast,Providing_information
Increasing  bearingoffset  increases the mass and decreases the factorofsafety,Providing_information
consider in that case that it would instead be more valuable to consistently keep the lower corrected flywheeldiameter value to actually conserve mass,Providing_information
can i still see that our rocket system s end factorofsafety is around 68? odd,Asking_for_information
Whats it at with  45  ? ,Asking_for_information
can you increase diameter is that we need to higher factorofsafety,Providing_information
i don t know  but mine is best at  105 ,Asking_for_information
it should be said no?,Asking_for_information
I mean  I mass the low factorofsafety of  2   01  now and can t really cut any more mass,Providing_information
but right along now i have a total body mass point of 1 49 and factorofsafety of approximately 4 or 55 k which appears probably to be good via rubric,Providing_information
that is what I uploaded to me more consistent  My values did not change though,Providing_information
your part,Providing_information
Keeping it at  40  works best for me  what about the others ? ,Providing_information
well who s another factorofsafety changed?,Asking_for_information
sounds good however i just tried my middle values online and will finally broadcast that,Providing_information
alright  what factorofsafety  s are you getting  my lowest factorofsafety situation is still  323 ,Asking_for_information
do you change the piston diameter at all,Asking_for_information
2 18 01 sorry,Providing_information
what does by changing that do?,Asking_for_information
anyone wanna wanna do me a favor and broadcast the value rating of 45,Asking_for_information
yes i believe,Providing_information
why i immediately asked if they changed their last broadcasted values from excellent,Asking_for_information
i have a not,Providing_information
increasing the value of a bearingoffset presents two main adverse cases where me mass increases decreases and factorofsafety size decreases so i mass p tending roughly towards bearingoffset equals down to minus 60,Providing_information
hey your looks... like as our factorofsafety went up what actually changed?,Asking_for_information
we have excellent quality right now,Providing_information
who s factorofsafety changed,Asking_for_information
it affects the design variable or bearingoffset which possibly the length axis of the bearing may support offset,Providing_information
If it s important  increasing  flywheelthickness  increases mass but decreases factorofsafety,Providing_information
so i was looking at what factor l of average safety weight weight range is actually excellent and trying out to get the lowest mass with a high factor of safety around 2,Providing_information
i just lowered writing it over to 25 plus 23 that really is low for the crankshaft,Providing_information
okay we re still above a factor of safety of  2  thought so don t worry about it,Providing_information
what are your current values ?  Parameters you chose,Asking_for_information
oops my sorry it s tonight at 80,Providing_information
Can you max out the flywheeldiameter value to see what happens ? ,Providing_information
what was the flywheel thickness used ? ,Asking_for_information
think i has optimized only my part with mass equals 14 to 52 cm and factorofsafety equals to mach 2 and 01,Providing_information
now but if... i increase the thickness i could make it a better lot higher,Asking_for_information
have you changed down the suspension system anything at all? our quality has dropped,Asking_for_information
we are at excelelent again,Providing_information
i only dropped back my mass by 0 02,Providing_information
thickness of any i - section equals 7 to 3,Providing_information
it also is at a 75 though,Providing_information
you re in charge of the crankshaft bearing offset  right ? ,Asking_for_information
Does increasing the flywheel thickness increase or decrease  bearingoffset  ? ,Asking_for_information
now ok my factorofsafety values range from 1 point to type 8,Providing_information
i know don t change that i may only change by bearingoffset now and then pistonborediameter _ for bearingoffset,Providing_information
I just lowered it to  25   23   That is low for the crankshaft,Providing_information
Hey what mass are you getting ? ,Asking_for_information
Thats my max,Providing_information
mine but still says excellent but this i have not therefore changed anythign,Providing_information
for flywheelthickness  equals to   10    flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  ;  mass  equals to   0   55  and factorofsafety  equals to   5625   56 ,Providing_information
If you increase your pistonborediameter what does that do to mass ? ,Asking_for_information
yeah but 45 should be fine if instead you... dont suddenly want people to go lower,Providing_information
i stop changing,Providing_information
flywheelthickness  equals to   10   flywheeldiameter  equals to   25 ,Providing_information
what you s your first factorofsafety?,Asking_for_information
How does the flywheel thickness factor into the bearing support offset and crankshaft mass ? ,Asking_for_information
just i updated my broadcast mass of mine and is 1 ft 49,Providing_information
flywheelthickness  equals to   10  mm ;  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  mm ; ,Providing_information
My mass is lowered and my factorofsafety is just above  2 ,Providing_information
i ve also just broadcasted the most recent simulation events but this battle will all definitely not be the next final one,Providing_information
any logical way you can decrease mass,Providing_information
Hey  How does the value of my crank pin diameter affect your design ? ,Asking_for_information
per mine depth is thus optimized as with mass equals to 0 12 b and single factorofsafety equals to 3 44 when you already have the pistonborediameter equals equal to 40,Providing_information
flywheel changed a value and by i had lost 5 lb lbs,Providing_information
drivers increasing their flywheeldiameter load will increase ship mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
thickness is flywheelthickness  equals to   10 ,Providing_information
What s keeping the piston bore from being minimized to  75   if I may ask ?  I think we were hitting an  excellent  rating when it was at  75  earlier ,Asking_for_information
thickness of I-section  equals to   3 ,Providing_information
 40  works for me,Providing_information
mine is mass of  6   33  and factorofsafety of  2   23 ,Providing_information
how does increasing the flywheel thickness also factor into with the shaft bearing support plate offset and crankshaft mass?,Asking_for_information
just slightly updated relative to flywheelthickness this equals to mach 10 flywheeldiameter it equals to 15 kw and shaved 03 kg at limited build cost,Providing_information
even our quality record is back down still to good what changed?,Asking_for_information
It increases pretty fast,Providing_information
either is there a bore of diameter you are set on? or they are all you still experimenting?,Asking_for_information
what seems to be the ideal piston bore diameter on your end ?  Could you explain how it affects mass and factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
per flywheelthickness equals 3 to 10 flywheeldiameter performance equals to track 25,Providing_information
overall factorofsafety is  1   7 ,Providing_information
What does changing that do ? ,Asking_for_information
update the broadcast,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to  60   dc equals to  15 ,Providing_information
does changing any other s parameters help bring your mass down ? ,Asking_for_information
I don t think that was my doing  I have been broadcasting factorofsafety values around  8 ,Providing_information
Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
i chose from the next smallest values to give smallest potential weight on my end,Providing_information
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Providing_information
thats as low as I have gotten it,Providing_information
it depends heavily on piston diameter,Providing_information
yes  currently it is at  2   27 ,Providing_information
just updated with my broadcast mass rating of mine is 5 1 49,Providing_information
gee hey how does the value of limiting my crank pin wheel diameter affect... your design?,Asking_for_information
i guess what was i mass saying today is if you can only marginally increase mass to this increasing factorofsafety more yet noticeably that you might not be a better new compromise,Providing_information
based overall on bearingoffset equals to level 60?,Asking_for_information
Who has the factorofsafety of   57  ?  we need to work on increasing that,Asking_for_information
any factorofsafety higher than  2  gets us nothing more  we need to drop mass,Providing_information
min of episode 40,Providing_information
just what where s keeping the piston bore up from being automatically minimized to 75 degree if i may ask? i think perhaps we were hitting an excellent rating base when it itself was at around 75 earlier,Asking_for_information
his 45 seems decent,Providing_information
but i don t know when but mine is their best at 105,Asking_for_information
where im at a factorofsafety of just over 2 weeks so maybe i just think i mass good unless we need people to cut you more cell mass,Providing_information
i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get,Providing_information
Increasing flywheeldiameter will increase mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
is your mass and factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
is your mass high ? ,Asking_for_information
no i don t t think so,Providing_information
just updated to flywheelthickness  equals to   10   flywheeldiameter  equals to   15  and shaved   03 kg at limited cost,Providing_information
i also don or t know then what has changed ill rebroadcast what i have had when we originally were good,Providing_information
i didn t ever change over it from when it said excellent for catching me,Providing_information
I have now   I canchange it back,Providing_information
Can you send me your current values ? ,Asking_for_information
In that case it would be more valuable to keep the lower flywheeldiameter value to conserve mass,Providing_information
said yes i believe,Providing_information
I am trying but it lowers my factorofsafety as well  I ll see if I can do anything furhter,Providing_information
if any you just increase by your hand pistonborediameter what does that do to mass?,Asking_for_information
If I reduce my mass by   03   it reduces factorofsafety by   25  to  1   76 ,Providing_information
right around now i have a weighted total mass ratio of at 1 49 c and factorofsafety of 4 55 which therefore appears to be really good data via rubric,Providing_information

do you need any of my variables ? ,Asking_for_information
Mass is  0   1  right ? ,Asking_for_information
no - must be someone else I guess ? ,Asking_for_information
is your design at the lowest possible weight ? ,Asking_for_information
What value are you using for your piston bore diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
Can you change that to  85  ?  or close to it ?  That s what I have,Asking_for_information
what is your crankshaft mass ?  And are you still using  70  for your crankshaft offset ? ,Asking_for_information
is the factorofsafety of the design the lowest factorofsafety of any one subsystem ? ,Asking_for_information
Are you changing your broadcast values a lot,Asking_for_information
whats your mass,Asking_for_information

did your mass just change a ton,Asking_for_information
did you change your mass a lot just now,Asking_for_information
did you change your mass a lot just now,Asking_for_information
what is yours ? ,Asking_for_information
what is your current mass ? ,Asking_for_information
did u change the mass a lot just now ? ,Asking_for_information
What parameters affect your part ? ,Asking_for_information
does your design depend on the crankshaft ? ,Asking_for_information
They asked about my bore and nothing since,Asking_for_information
and how so ? ,Asking_for_information
so for you design a lower bearingoffset is better ?  does dc affect yours at all ? ,Asking_for_information
Hows it looking now,Asking_for_information
if I change it to  75   will it affect your design,Asking_for_information
Alrighty - how are your mass and factorofsafety numbers looking,Asking_for_information
are you still using  40  for the diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
how s your factorofsafety looking,Asking_for_information
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations,Asking_for_information
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? ,Asking_for_information
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? ,Asking_for_information
does your design depend on the flywheel at all ? ,Asking_for_information
Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not,Asking_for_information
could we go with pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Asking_for_information
Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not,Asking_for_information
Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not,Asking_for_information
If you need the offset to be higher let me know ,Asking_for_information
What can I change to help improve your design ? ,Asking_for_information
factorofsafety no,Asking_for_information
can u up factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
Do you depend on any of my variables ? ,Asking_for_information
definitely try and get your factorofsafety up ,Asking_for_information
factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
do you rely on a bearingoffset or a dc ? ,Asking_for_information
What would you like ? ,Asking_for_information
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Asking_for_information
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Asking_for_information
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Asking_for_information
Mine is in the range of thousands  So i guess I don t have to worry about it ?  only the smallest matters right,Asking_for_information
What happens when you decrease piston diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
okay we need this factorofsafety to go up,Asking_for_information
your factorofsafety is in the thousands ?  ?  ?  ? ,Asking_for_information
right  but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations ?  Do you have one ? ,Asking_for_information
Are you broadcasting  2   77 ,Asking_for_information
Can you do  20  ? ,Asking_for_information
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Asking_for_information
are you changing your values at all,Asking_for_information
trying,Asking_for_information
and mass ? ,Asking_for_information
Gotcha trying to figure out the dependencies,Asking_for_information
Which factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Asking_for_information
make sure you update the global broadcast,Asking_for_information
what s the diameter at this point ? ,Asking_for_information
make sure you update the global broadcast,Asking_for_information
make sure you update the global broadcast,Asking_for_information
Is your offset still the same ? ,Asking_for_information
also which factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Asking_for_information
what is your factorofsafety now ? ,Asking_for_information
what ur factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
does only the lowest person s factorofsafety matter ? ,Asking_for_information
whats ur factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
what ur factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? ,Asking_for_information
what is your factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
Factor of safety is  5000  ?  ? ,Asking_for_information
so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? ,Asking_for_information
I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
What about you ? ,Asking_for_information
ah  change it back to  80  then ? ,Asking_for_information
 ? ,Asking_for_information
mass ? ,Asking_for_information

What affects your mass the most ? ,Asking_for_information
what are your numbers,Asking_for_information
What are those three ? ,Asking_for_information
Did you broadcast that,Asking_for_information
mass ? ,Asking_for_information
I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts,Asking_for_information
Also  be sure to tell me if the bore diameter changes ,Asking_for_information
done ,Asking_for_information
what is your diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
and what are your numbers when you do that,Asking_for_information
We need an factorofsafety of  2  don t we ?  We are at  1   1 ,Asking_for_information
ok what about mass ? ,Asking_for_information
hey try changing the diameter to  90 ,Asking_for_information
we need to do better though lol,Asking_for_information
do you have any variable that seems to match with those ? ,Asking_for_information
Would it be possible for you to increase your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
Did they not ask what the bore diameter was ? ,Asking_for_information
you re going to keep it at  80  ? ,Asking_for_information
Whichever gets you the highest,Asking_for_information
Because they asked me for that,Asking_for_information
done,Asking_for_information
Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with ? ,Asking_for_information
whats the best factorofsafety you ve had ? ,Asking_for_information
let me know if you need to go any lower,Asking_for_information
did you get your mass down ? ,Asking_for_information
okay  Have you talked to the other subsystems about only changing one subsytem at a time ? ,Asking_for_information
Did you broadcast anything recently ? ,Asking_for_information
What s the updated mass for the crankshaft ? ,Asking_for_information
Did you broadcast anything recently ? ,Asking_for_information
  _   ?   _  ,Asking_for_information
are you using my dc dimension ? ,Asking_for_information
What are your two variables at,Asking_for_information
Are you still using  70  for the offset ? ,Asking_for_information
dc ? ,Asking_for_information
Have you broadcasted anything recently ? ,Asking_for_information
so  currently where are we with factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
Would going higher help ? ,Asking_for_information
Trying to figure out what caused the spike in weight,Asking_for_information

Anything else I can help optimse ? ,Asking_for_information
hmmm  okay do u wnat to try that ? ,Asking_for_information
what are yous mass factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
what is your weight at  75  and what is it at  80  ? ,Asking_for_information
what are your mass factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
did u try everyone else ?  cause our mass is too high,Asking_for_information
Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there ? ,Asking_for_information
what are yourmass factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values ? ,Asking_for_information
do you have any variable that seems to relate to them ? ,Asking_for_information
what are your mass factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
what is your bore diameter now ? ,Asking_for_information
What does your system factorofsafety value say ?  mine are all like over  4000  even when i minimize mass,Asking_for_information
so t equals to  10  flywheeldiameter equals to  25  ? ,Asking_for_information
Who depends on your variables ? ,Asking_for_information
Still  40 mm  Will increasing bore help your design ? ,Asking_for_information
What parameters increaes your factorofsafety or mass ? ,Asking_for_information
ok can u tell everyone that we agreed to move ?  i will also ,Asking_for_information
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Asking_for_information
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Asking_for_information
 1643   92  ? ,Asking_for_information
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
A factorofsafety of higher than  1000  ? ,Asking_for_information
did it affect the overall ? ,Asking_for_information
got it,Asking_for_information
are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness,Asking_for_information
I don t think it is an average is it ? ,Asking_for_information
Whats the max factorofsafety you can get ?  without adding too much weight,Asking_for_information
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Asking_for_information
try changing your other values ? ,Asking_for_information
can you get that factorofsafety up ? ,Asking_for_information
wait your flywheeldiameter is  15  now ? ,Asking_for_information
adjust which part ? ,Asking_for_information
now it s back  ?  ?  idk,Asking_for_information
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? ,Asking_for_information
now it s back  ?  ?  idk,Asking_for_information
now it s back  ?  ?  idk,Asking_for_information
now it s back  ?  ?  idk,Asking_for_information
were they significantly different twenty minutes ago ? ,Asking_for_information
Do u depend on the bore diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? ,Asking_for_information
does it affect your design much ?  If I increase it to  60  it will only increase my mass by like 0   3 ,Asking_for_information
what about thickness of flywheel ? ,Asking_for_information
we have excellent quality right now,Providing_information
we have excellent quality right now,Providing_information
Yes  my most recent design is what is broadcasted,Providing_information
It looks like our engine design is excellent then  And yes that works with my design requirements,Providing_information
I mass still seeing  poor  on my end,Providing_information
oh wait no,Providing_information
don t know if we can stop or if we have to go the full  45  minutes,Providing_information
yeah uhhh that looks good  nice ,Providing_information
lol great,Providing_information
I haven t broadcasted yet ho,Providing_information
 tho,Providing_information
we should aim for a smaller total mass  it s a little close to  40 ,Providing_information
ta said we re good,Providing_information
I dont think we were supposed to finish that quick,Providing_information
im at  2   07 ,Providing_information
My mass varies between  0 - 0   12  so let me know if you need me to adjust anything,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
My mass varies between  0 - 0   12  so let me know if you need me to adjust anything,Providing_information
not me,Providing_information
mine is still at excellent so I don t know,Providing_information
I just got my mass down to  0   11 ,Providing_information
mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   59 ,Providing_information
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Providing_information
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Providing_information
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Providing_information
I am getting around  2   26 - 2   95 ,Providing_information
thats if pistonborediameter  equals to   45  where pistonborediameter is the piston bore diameter,Providing_information
the  2   95  design also has the lowest mass,Providing_information
Make sure you dont drop too much mass though,Providing_information
If that reduces your factorofsafety,Providing_information
Piston diameter and thickness,Providing_information
alright,Providing_information
not for me  on mine it says fair,Providing_information
yeah it does but all of the factorofsafety have been over  2  except one of them,Providing_information
I dont use flywheeldiameter I think,Providing_information
k,Providing_information
interstingly pisto-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Providing_information
Yeah I noticed the same thing,Providing_information
interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Providing_information
interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Providing_information
No  I do not believe so,Providing_information
I can get mine up to  3   44  max where pistonborediameter  equals to   40 ,Providing_information
It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn t have to blindly flail about  not knowing who has been told what yet,Providing_information
it keeps changing for me  but none of the Key Design variables change,Providing_information
yeah exactly,Providing_information
broadcast that,Providing_information
idk they haven t been super responsive,Providing_information
No  I believe my variables are independent of shaft diameter,Providing_information
No only the inner piston bore diameter,Providing_information
currently at mass  47   81   factorofsafety  2   32 ,Providing_information
also you can only see a few of the design variables  so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn t as good,Providing_information
leave yours as is for now  piston is biggest factor rn,Providing_information
leave yours as is for now  piston is biggest factor rn,Providing_information
I haven t changed a thing,Providing_information
aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click  check for broadcast ,Providing_information
from when it was at excellent,Providing_information
I think were at safe right now,Providing_information
me either,Providing_information
wonderful system  this is ,Providing_information
we went from excellent to poor  rip,Providing_information
We need to trim mass,Providing_information
The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass,Providing_information
I think its the piston changing but not sure,Providing_information
I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality,Providing_information
My weight varies between  0   0  and  0   12  so im the wrong person to reduce weight,Providing_information
If I drop my weight way down though my factorofsafety is super trash,Providing_information
My individual mass is  1   27 ,Providing_information
keep it up and we ll trim from there,Providing_information
mine is  6   33  I can try and lower it back to  6   26 ,Providing_information
No  my factorofsafety values are all greater than  300  ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
I am at about  0   11 ,Providing_information
I can try and trim a little more tho ,Providing_information
piston pin affects factorofsafety most but can t trim much weight,Providing_information
me either,Providing_information
 0   11 ,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
might be piston,Providing_information
Crankshaft is at  1   49  for mass,Providing_information
Not yet,Providing_information
mine is  2   47 ,Providing_information
 2   5 ,Providing_information
Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
global is at  2   47   individual is  15886   04 ,Providing_information
global just changed to  1   17 ,Providing_information
 80   150   12   60 ,Providing_information
I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at  0   10  and factorofsafety is  2   77 ,Providing_information
yep  just give me a sec,Providing_information
sweet,Providing_information
I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 ,Providing_information
I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 ,Providing_information
cool,Providing_information
alright ,Providing_information
Nice ,Providing_information
no i only see those  4 ,Providing_information
That should be good,Providing_information
thats the smallest weight and it gives part level factorofsafety of  4   55 ,Providing_information
We need to have the heavy parts drop mass,Providing_information
no I do not think it does  I was able to get my factorofsafety up above  3   4  though,Providing_information
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Providing_information
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Providing_information
I mass about to drop the factorofsafety and mass because rod designer said it might help them,Providing_information
min with highest factorofsafety,Providing_information
make sure it s broadcasting propperyly  I ve had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all,Providing_information
actually mine is just as good with the diameter at  80   the factorofsafety is just a little lower at  2   3 ,Providing_information
if i go all the way to min weight is cuts factorofsafety and only shaves   03 kg,Providing_information
I think L 1  does affect me though,Providing_information
hmm ok,Providing_information
definitely,Providing_information
 2   47 ,Providing_information
Same for me my factorofsafety drops waaaay down and shaves only  0   12  from mass,Providing_information
idk how but our mass earlier was  33   29  or something,Providing_information
most of the mass is in the crank  I think you and the crank have some dependency on one another,Providing_information
with a factorofsafety of  2   31 ,Providing_information
we are back to very good now too,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
Yeah  that was nice,Providing_information
crank is  30  lbs alone,Providing_information
back to very good,Providing_information
global is at  2   3  right now,Providing_information
i only depend on the piston,Providing_information
we may reduce pistonborediameter just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass,Providing_information
ya  should chat about that,Providing_information
sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter  connecting rod thickness  and connecting rod length ratio,Providing_information
chat with piston pin to determine that,Providing_information
pistonborediameter is min at  40  I think,Providing_information
I do not control that  All I can do is the ratio of L : r  and it s not called L 1 ,Providing_information
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,Providing_information
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,Providing_information
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
I haven t changed a thing since we were at excellent,Providing_information
Yeah i have the connecting rod at minimum thickness,Providing_information
And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum,Providing_information
good idea,Providing_information
I mass the low factorofsafety of  2   01   can you cut any more mass out,Providing_information
just did    03 kg,Providing_information
sweet,Providing_information
Yeah  that s not on me ,Providing_information
Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too,Providing_information
Same  Minimizing the piston bore would help me push stuff further down ,Providing_information
I hit up the piston but they never got back to me,Providing_information
  52   it s minimized,Providing_information
completely,Providing_information
Im at  0   1  rn with a factorofsafety of  2   52 ,Providing_information
still factorofsafety of over  1000 ,Providing_information
Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
my weight is minimized completely factorofsafety  equals to   1212 ,Providing_information
my mass is minimized,Providing_information
at  0   1 ,Providing_information
Lmao thats massive,Providing_information
the program won t let me go any lower,Providing_information
same here  it would reduce my masses a bit,Providing_information
Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow,Providing_information
I can reduce my mass by   03  and that reduces factorofsafety by   25  to  1   76 ,Providing_information
I just saved mass changing flywheelthickness to  30 ,Providing_information
Because everyone else is min mass,Providing_information
true ,Providing_information
yeah  working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass,Providing_information
Havent heard back from piston though,Providing_information
dont do that,Providing_information
If you increase the piston bore diameter  pistonborediameter  it increases my factorofsafety,Providing_information
yeah that is what i am thinking as well,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
not me,Providing_information
I can probably drop down by another  0   01  or  0   02  if necessary,Providing_information
flywheelthickness increases mass ,Providing_information
pistons mass is  0   52  with a factorofsafety of  2   01 ,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
though i guess it s more efficient mass than the shaft,Providing_information
I can ask but I mass worried not everyone s was updated,Providing_information
I still see the total mass of  2   84 ,Providing_information
I see  2   73 ,Providing_information
yeah nope,Providing_information
well  update your broadcast,Providing_information
lmk when you do,Providing_information
Mine are  but i have not made any drastic changes since  Your lowering of flywheeldiameter helped me shave off  2  more lbs,Providing_information
Alright  I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design  so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens,Providing_information
i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Providing_information
i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Providing_information
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Providing_information
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Providing_information
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Providing_information
we can optimize bearingoffset and flywheelthickness looks like,Providing_information
as long as your factorofsafety  greater than   2  it doesnt matter,Providing_information
yeah check again  thats me  funny relations with crankshaft,Providing_information
it s corrected,Providing_information
yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel,Providing_information
I let them know,Providing_information
I think that doing that effects the other designs as well,Providing_information
I let the mknow,Providing_information
yeah  I see the change now,Providing_information
oh right,Providing_information
I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong,Providing_information
ok awesome,Providing_information
ahh  its changed for me,Providing_information
Actually we re only at  2   84 ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is still  700  so we can trim something on my end,Providing_information
No  that does not affect it either,Providing_information
it s corrected now,Providing_information
yeah they won t respond to my chats either,Providing_information
also i forgot factorofsafety is just the minimum value not an average,Providing_information
Ok  just making sure  thanks,Providing_information
If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our factorofsafety,Providing_information
sure give me a second,Providing_information
mine s still showing  80 ,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
oh alright,Providing_information
I double checked the handout and yeah  it s only dependent on lower factorofsafety,Providing_information
mass went up quite a bit on my end,Providing_information
even with max bearingoffset i still have factorofsafety  equals to   300 ,Providing_information
i havent changed anything,Providing_information
k  maybe not then,Providing_information
working with them now,Providing_information
i haven t either,Providing_information
piston,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
its the current broadcast ,Providing_information
Also lol looking back at my simulations  minimizing pistonborediameter actually increases my mass,Providing_information
factorofsafety went up to  2   22  and mass went up to  37   56  from  35   something,Providing_information
I just increased it by  2  mm and we are still slightly below our mass requirement,Providing_information
Go fast theyre giving out the money,Providing_information
Go fast theyre giving out the money,Providing_information
Bore diameter increased,Providing_information
Go fast theyre giving out the money,Providing_information
that wasn t me  I am trying to shave off that little bit,Providing_information
i mass going to reduce flywheelthickness and see if we can minimize both,Providing_information
i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get,Providing_information
 of mass,Providing_information
Nice ,Providing_information
generally our factorofsafety is fine  we need to decrease mass,Providing_information
i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get,Providing_information
hahahahaa,Providing_information
i have mine with the factorofsafety closest to  2  and lowest mass i can get,Providing_information
I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the factorofsafety,Providing_information
Ok  We need to try to decrease mass,Providing_information
It s been good working with Yall,Providing_information
It s been good working with Yall,Providing_information
It s been good working with Yall,Providing_information
It s been good working with Yall,Providing_information
same here  any small decrease in mass lowers factorofsafety by a lot for me,Providing_information
don t put it at whatever it was at for when it read excellent,Providing_information
Let me decrease my thickness a bit,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
stop changing,Providing_information
i mass not,Providing_information
stop changing,Providing_information
yee it has been good working with you as well,Providing_information
i haven t changed anything,Providing_information
we are in excellent ,Providing_information
we are in excellent ,Providing_information
we are in excellent ,Providing_information
we are at excellent again,Providing_information
we are in excellent ,Providing_information
I still see  40 ,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
don t change,Providing_information
ggs,Providing_information
ggs,Providing_information
ggs,Providing_information
ggs,Providing_information
you change let me lose  5  lbs  Thanks fellow engineer ,Providing_information
yesss just the handfull of cash,Providing_information
good working with ya,Providing_information
good working with ya,Providing_information
Sorry for the abrupt message,Providing_information
nope you re good,Providing_information
flywheel changed a value and i lost  5  lbs ,Providing_information
we re at excellent,Providing_information
we re at excellent,Providing_information
Oh wait we hit excellent,Providing_information
wow ,Providing_information
awesome job,Providing_information
It says currently broadcasting  42  on my end,Providing_information
 ,Providing_information
Ok  I decreased my weight a little bit,Providing_information
 Your change  I got typing too fast,Providing_information
That s odd  I see  40   but I will change it to  42 ,Providing_information
gg,Providing_information
Thanks  good job ,Providing_information
gg,Providing_information
gg,Providing_information
thanks  you too ,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to  60   dc equals to  15 ,Providing_information
TA is saying time is up,Providing_information
Good job ,Providing_information
Time is up i believe,Providing_information
dc is the weight variable for me,Providing_information
thanks   :  ,Providing_information
time is up i believe,Providing_information
We ve got a  Good  engine,Providing_information
time is up i believe,Providing_information
good job ,Providing_information
good job ,Providing_information
We ve got a  Good  engine,Providing_information
okay we got excellent  we should be done here,Providing_information
nice work,Providing_information
nice work ,Providing_information
nice work ,Providing_information
I already got paid haha  although they said if you keep improving it we can get more even afterwars,Providing_information
 afterwards,Providing_information
not yet,Providing_information
I think we can keep going,Providing_information
Yep just got paid,Providing_information
we should probably stop adjusting our values  we got excellent now and its going to be hard to make it any better,Providing_information
Currently the size is  40 ,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
Hi  :  ,Providing_information
Currently the Piston Bore Diameter is  40 ,Providing_information
Hey  I am going to need the flywheel shaft diameter and the thickness of the flywheel  Do you have any possible numbers,Providing_information
Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel diameter,Providing_information
hi,Providing_information
Thanks  :   I ll work with that for now  let me know if you end up making any final changes,Providing_information
mine are piston diameter and head thickness,Providing_information
Sounds good,Providing_information
 30  at the moment  but haven t run many yet,Providing_information
Hello  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0 ,Providing_information
They are t _ I and r _  1  ,Providing_information
I need to find the optimum value for that  Assume it to be  25  for now,Providing_information
I mass starting with  40 ,Providing_information
 130 ,Providing_information
mm,Providing_information
I am going to try  160   The larger the offset the larger the mass and smaller factorofsafety,Providing_information
diameter is  90 ,Providing_information
mine are piston diameter and head thickness,Providing_information
diamater is  90 ,Providing_information
 3   21 ,Providing_information
Don t know if this matters to you  but the connecting rod I section is  2  mm and the ratio of length between the connecting rod and crank length is  3 ,Providing_information
Ok  I don t think so either  but sent just in case,Providing_information
it requires piston bore diameter  any range from  75  to  105 ,Providing_information
 75  mm,Providing_information
all good,Providing_information
thanks,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
i used  40 mm,Providing_information
 75  mm,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
 75  mm is the bore diameter,Providing_information
Thanks  If you need them  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0 ,Providing_information
I mass pretty sure I will leave the thickness at  10  mm,Providing_information
ok Ill try that,Providing_information
When I use maximum values  the mass is  36   38  and f is  22   95  ,Providing_information
Nope,Providing_information
That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control,Providing_information
 22   4  and  1   5 ,Providing_information
check for broadcast,Providing_information
Large   3852   93 ,Providing_information
and also maximizing all the other variables I need,Providing_information
It does not affect my simulation ,Providing_information
ill check,Providing_information
cool,Providing_information
I have not decided on them yet ,Providing_information
Smaller works better for my factorofsafety and Mass,Providing_information
and my variables are thickness of connecting rod and ratio of length of connecting rod and crank length,Providing_information
was given wrong packet to start,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
I mass getting a factorofsafety over  4000  with a thickness of  12   so I think  12   the minumum  is fine,Providing_information
Increasing the diameter will increase both factor of safety as well as the mass,Providing_information
A higher diameter increases the factorofsafety but also increases the mass  with pistonborediameter equals to  40  im at a mass of  0   1  and factorofsafety  2   77 ,Providing_information
Ok  Crankshaft bearing offset :   150   0   Crankshaft-pin diameter :   50   0  ,Providing_information
I mass trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the factorofsafety while minimizing its mass,Providing_information
Ok thanks,Providing_information
Those do not effect me  I may have a slight say in crank length ,Providing_information
Don t think so,Providing_information
 85  is the updated,Providing_information
flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and pistonborediameter,Providing_information
Hey  I mass good for now  thanks  let me know if you need anything from me,Providing_information
I think I can work with that,Providing_information
Piston bore diamteter,Providing_information
I do not,Providing_information
for sure  go for it,Providing_information
piston head thickness and piston bore diameter,Providing_information
Flywheel shaft diameter,Providing_information
 40 ,Providing_information
and Thickness of the flywheel,Providing_information
Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel Shaft Diameter,Providing_information
I used  40  mm which is the minimum value I can use,Providing_information
I should be good for now,Providing_information
I don t think so  all I need is piston bore diameter,Providing_information
going with the minimum to reduce mass because my factorofsafety is so high,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod lenth and the crank lenth,Providing_information
No  I do not need anything,Providing_information
try flyweel thickness as  12   0  and shaft diameter as  60   0 ,Providing_information
ok conrod s variables also depends on piston bore diameter,Providing_information
sure,Providing_information
i do not,Providing_information
i think you might have to increase it,Providing_information
i ll set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there,Providing_information
No at most ill change it by  10   how much would a diameter of  50  affect your mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
crankshaft s variables also depends on piston bore diameter,Providing_information
Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do ,Providing_information
Okay,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there,Providing_information
Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do ,Providing_information
I currently have it as small as possible because that seems beneficial ,Providing_information
ok sounds good,Providing_information
Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do ,Providing_information
i have the crankshaft bearing offset and diameter,Providing_information
nah chat with piston deisgner,Providing_information
check for broadcast,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Providing_information
I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter,Providing_information
crankshaft bearing offset and diameter,Providing_information
we are using  75  mm rn,Providing_information
Okay I have piston piston diameter  pistonborediameter  and and piston pin length  l 1   and inner and outer piston pin diameters  di  do ,Providing_information
using  85  and  15 ,Providing_information
and I have no variables controlled by others,Providing_information
using  85  and  15 ,Providing_information
I dont have any other dependent variables,Providing_information
ok cool,Providing_information
 2   31 ,Providing_information
 2   04 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to  75 ,Providing_information
Actually our mass is already way over  I ll probably keep it the same,Providing_information
piston bore diameter affects both crankshaft and conrods  variables,Providing_information
so im going to max piston bore diamter and well iterate from there,Providing_information
I have my best values broadcast with   12 kg and factorofsafety equals to  3   44 ,Providing_information
I control Flywheel thickness and Flywheel shaft diameter  I need Crankshaft Bearing Offset,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Providing_information
It s up,Providing_information
Projected outputs,Providing_information
got  0   1 kg and factorofsafety  equals to   2   77 ,Providing_information
it is best for me,Providing_information
Nice ,Providing_information
 11   11 ,Providing_information
basically bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to  15 ,Providing_information
We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer ,Providing_information
We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer ,Providing_information
bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15 ,Providing_information
Haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy  It seems we ve all broadcast our stuff,Providing_information
those are my values,Providing_information
pistonborediameter is critical to increase the weight for my simulation,Providing_information
I set t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4   and the quality turns out to be excellent,Providing_information
so flywheeldiameter doesn t make a difference for my factorofsafety,Providing_information
Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 ,Providing_information
I believe factorofsafety of  2   31 ,Providing_information
Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 ,Providing_information
Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 ,Providing_information
I chose  40 mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it s good for him or her if I use maximum value,Providing_information
Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 ,Providing_information
Oh wait nevermind  I don t think we have a piston pin engineer though ,Providing_information
Oh wait nevermind  I don t think we have a piston pin engineer though ,Providing_information
 4000 ,Providing_information
However  I cannot do that because it s critical to the weight of piston,Providing_information
 6   45  now,Providing_information
I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length,Providing_information
Actually  2   83   read the wrong one,Providing_information
my mass is pretty low already  But make sure to broadcast variables,Providing_information
input shaft wheel diameter,Providing_information
I have a high factorofsafety for everywhere in my combination of ranges,Providing_information
Am broadcasting  150  and  50 ,Providing_information
Oh yeah okay ,Providing_information
Way to be on top of things  I won t vote you off the island,Providing_information
lol,Providing_information
I updated,Providing_information
rightt,Providing_information
yeah Im doing that after every sim  we re already in the very good range,Providing_information
bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to   15 ,Providing_information
I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually  So we cannot optimize that part ,Providing_information
I used  70 mm  Try to update yours,Providing_information
mine shows poor,Providing_information
piston have control over diameter as well  I need the diameter for my variables,Providing_information
I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety,Providing_information
I don t know how that affects me  but my simulation shows excellent  I think someone isn t broadcasting the right values,Providing_information
I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety,Providing_information
I ve changed the diameter to  53  to try to help with your factor of safety,Providing_information
Piston pin designer said it is in very good range,Providing_information
wait someone changed something and it went way down,Providing_information
I mass trying to test new values  I mass currently trying it with  80 ,Providing_information
they were the minimum of both,Providing_information
Okay update your pistonborediameter but try to keep it relatively low if possible,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is best at  40   making it larger decreases my factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok i dont have those values in my test bed,Providing_information
Yeah  I was looking at the factor of safety and realized that with the head so small  the factorofsafety wasn t gonna go up,Providing_information
 4  for head thickness and  75  for piston diameter,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
If I hold my variables same  the lower the diameter  the lower the Ms and factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok keep those for now,Providing_information
my factor of safety is maximized at low bearingoffset values,Providing_information
my variables are t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4  ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor,Providing_information
yes pistonpin said same thing,Providing_information
i ll rebroadcast with those values,Providing_information
i havnt changed anything,Providing_information
mass is  0   54  and factorofsafety is  3286 ,Providing_information
yes do that,Providing_information
I havnt changed anything,Providing_information
I had an excellent quality  but with someone s new broadcast  it s not poor,Providing_information
now ,Providing_information
with pistonborediameter equals to  53   i got mass equals to  0   13 kg and factorofsafety  equals to   3   18 ,Providing_information
My flywheel is as small as possible  flywheelthickness  equals to   12  flywheeldiameter  equals to   40   factorofsafety is still in the thousands ,Providing_information
Yea  but also the weight,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
Thanks  I ll run some simulations with those numbers,Providing_information
No idea,Providing_information
mine is  2   44 ,Providing_information
mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Providing_information
our factor of safety went down,Providing_information
mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Providing_information
piston is about to update me with pistonborediameter  I need it to be low too  How about you,Providing_information
mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Providing_information
mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Providing_information
Didn t change anything  We need to decrease mass,Providing_information
ms is just below  2   factorofsafety is around  20 ,Providing_information
We once had an excellent quality though,Providing_information
or avg,Providing_information
only need a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
okay  I will see what i can do with  53 ,Providing_information
Our factorofsafety was at like  2   5  and mass was at  44   Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton ,Providing_information
 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Providing_information
someone is messing this up  are values are getting very bad,Providing_information
crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter  so I used  70 mm,Providing_information
 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Providing_information
i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier,Providing_information
 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Providing_information
 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Providing_information
yeah thats ok the factorofsafety for othee s will be less,Providing_information
alright I will try and reduce the mass,Providing_information
i just rebroadcasted,Providing_information
ok I have mass :   3   05   factorofsafety  2   02 ,Providing_information
 3286  right now,Providing_information
Yeah everything is going down now  Not sure why  I haven t chantged anything for like  10  mins ,Providing_information
the thickness t _ I  ranges from  5  to  15  mm  and ratio r 1   ranges from  5  to  5 ,Providing_information
I feel like its the crankshaft guy  everyone else has high factorofsafety,Providing_information
Every  10  pistonborediameter I decrease from  70   mass decrease like  0   2 - 0   3 ,Providing_information
thickness is  10  and diameter is  22 ,Providing_information
i just changed my variables back to their minimum,Providing_information
I think you could decrease mass bc factorofsafety only needs to be above  2 ,Providing_information
Must be,Providing_information
He wont respond lol,Providing_information
 85  seems good for now  testing my own combinations,Providing_information
 4 ,Providing_information
it was excelent  someone messed it up,Providing_information
thats what they were at when we had excellent,Providing_information
i tried  95 ,Providing_information
the minimum mass I have while the factorofsafety is above  2  is  5   45   I have made  14  simulations to justify the result ,Providing_information
My values of  150  and  50  are getting me highest factorofsafety and lowest mass,Providing_information
It doesn t matter for me,Providing_information
I can increase the factorofsafety  but it almost isn t worth it with how much weight is added on,Providing_information
ok ill see,Providing_information
i have mass  1   27   factorofsafety :   15886 ,Providing_information
Cause the factorofsafety only goes up by like   5 ,Providing_information
Great,Providing_information
I need a bore of at most  48 ,Providing_information
Yeah  mass is still high though,Providing_information
otherwise my factorofsafety is below  1 ,Providing_information
no my mass is  3   05  and my factorofsafety is  2   02 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is good  Mass is  10 kg too high,Providing_information
no it is not,Providing_information
The global variables are giving our current factorofsafety is  0   57  so I think we need to maximize that,Providing_information
The factorofsafety is  2   03   so there are no improvements available,Providing_information
My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 ,Providing_information
my best values currently are flywheelthickness  equals to   10  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25 ,Providing_information
flywheel factorofsafety are all very high,Providing_information
wow ok,Providing_information
My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 ,Providing_information
someones factorofsafety is too low,Providing_information
That s pretty minimal,Providing_information
now we are at very good,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
now VERY GOOd  we should sit here,Providing_information
now we are at very good,Providing_information
factorofsafety decrease like  2 - 3 ,Providing_information
yeah  told him to reduce it to save some weight,Providing_information
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Providing_information
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Providing_information
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Providing_information
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Providing_information
I haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy,Providing_information
Works for me,Providing_information
 2   83 ,Providing_information
ok don t change anything,Providing_information
no we should go for excellent,Providing_information
Will experiment,Providing_information
we already had it once,Providing_information
ok don t change anything,Providing_information
ok don t change anything,Providing_information
ok don t change anything,Providing_information
We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol ,Providing_information
We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol ,Providing_information
agreed  we can still try to look for improvements,Providing_information
We get   17  if no one touches anything  Save your values lol ,Providing_information
Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 ,Providing_information
Is  75  still the number youre going with,Providing_information
 To all  :  ok with results,Providing_information
 To all  :  ok with results,Providing_information
 To all  :  ok with results,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
 To all  :  ok with results,Providing_information
very big,Providing_information
yeah we are now at very good,Providing_information
increases,Providing_information
My outputs  Global is  34   35  and  0   81 ,Providing_information
I mass not sure why they aren t updating though when I change my input values,Providing_information
also decreases my factorofsafety,Providing_information
 45  equals to  1   7    48  equals to  1   15 ,Providing_information
based on the handout we should be at  excellent  idk why it doesn t say that,Providing_information
No i think its fine i was just curious,Providing_information
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Providing_information
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Providing_information
Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 ,Providing_information
values are at a minimum for me,Providing_information
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Providing_information
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Providing_information
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Providing_information
I mass not sure why they aren t updating though when I change my input values,Providing_information
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Providing_information
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Providing_information
i havnt changed anything  my variables seem to be the best so far,Providing_information
try to decrease you mass while keeping a factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
our mass is too high rn,Providing_information
Recheck your broadcast  it just went to poor,Providing_information
It went down again,Providing_information
it was just at very good  someone changed and it went up a lot,Providing_information
recheck it,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
the mass shot up,Providing_information
Yea I just asked him,Providing_information
It went down again,Providing_information
It went down again,Providing_information
it just went back to  poor ,Providing_information
I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length,Providing_information
ok with the results,Providing_information
try to get the mass down below  40 ,Providing_information
although the new broadcast increased the mass,Providing_information
Lets decrease mass,Providing_information
I think he ll need my Diameter to increarse  but if i do that then piston-pin factorofsafety goes below  1 ,Providing_information
lets decrease mass,Providing_information
I have control of thickness of I-section  conrod length and the crank length,Providing_information
yeah I haven t changed anything,Providing_information
your specific results will be in the table under the charts,Providing_information
Nevermind  global changed to  55   36  and  2   03 ,Providing_information
I mass not entirely sure  No matter what inputs I have  my mass and factorofsafety aren t changing and it ; s a bit confusing,Providing_information
idk,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
haven t changed anything on my end  that s weird,Providing_information
i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum,Providing_information
Yeah for a bit ,Providing_information
Mass :   1   75  factorofsafety :  6   07 ,Providing_information
I havent updated anything,Providing_information
I mass getting poor right now,Providing_information
Ok  try reducing the diameter to  45  and see what happens,Providing_information
Keep  70  mm I mass trying to get out of the poor region,Providing_information
Will keep you updated,Providing_information
 1   2 ,Providing_information
Just pistonborediameter,Providing_information
But I haven t changed anything and it went down ,Providing_information
I havent updated anything  so it was either crankshaft or connecting rod,Providing_information
but mine is flywheel  wont get any lower,Providing_information
Gotcha,Providing_information
I do not believe so,Providing_information
wait,Providing_information
haven t changed anything on my ene,Providing_information
yeah  0   09  isnt hot,Providing_information
end ,Providing_information
Gotcha,Providing_information
I just need pistonborediameter which I mass working on with you and piston,Providing_information
I tried decreasing my mass,Providing_information
increasing pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety,Providing_information
sorry,Providing_information
Yes  I just figured out how to use the software  Let me check it out,Providing_information
Yea  just a slight chance to fail,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated,Providing_information
the new one is  45  as of now,Providing_information
i tried decreasing my mass,Providing_information
Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated,Providing_information
yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good,Providing_information
Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down,Providing_information
I can t decrease mass anymore without going below a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down,Providing_information
It showed very good and I haven t changed anything since then ,Providing_information
sorry  I just need pistonborediameter as well,Providing_information
Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down,Providing_information
im pretty sure a factor of safety less than  1  is a guaranteed fail,Providing_information
I can t change it from here because it will lower mass  but it will also reduce factor of safety,Providing_information
yea,Providing_information
Working with you and piston as well,Providing_information
ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more,Providing_information
also i changed the diameter to  45 ,Providing_information
ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more,Providing_information
ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more,Providing_information
ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more,Providing_information
sweet  ill update my factorofsafety,Providing_information
No  My values have been the same since about  9  :  45  ,Providing_information
factorofsafety went from  3   18  to  2   95  and mass from  0   13  to  0   11 ,Providing_information
so its fine,Providing_information
I did not,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
Supposedly increasing the offset increases mass and decreases f  so lose-lose for me,Providing_information
for bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  flywheelthickness equals to   30  pistonborediameter  equals to   70  factorofsafety  equals to   2   37 ,Providing_information
i still have my two best broadcasted,Providing_information
mine is as low as possible too  We cant all have minimum mass,Providing_information
Cool  and that brings the piston-pin factorofsafety to just under  2 ,Providing_information
no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating,Providing_information
flywheelthickness just changes the mass for me,Providing_information
 27   44 ,Providing_information
we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted,Providing_information
yes so run it with those values a,Providing_information
we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted,Providing_information
he won t respond to me,Providing_information
we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted,Providing_information
we re almost out of time  double check to make sure you have the correct simulation broadcasted,Providing_information
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Providing_information
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Providing_information
higher flywheelthickness is better for me,Providing_information
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Providing_information
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Providing_information
try to decrease mass while keeping factorofsafety over  2 ,Providing_information

I just followed up with him,Providing_information
yeah  :  ,Providing_information
poor of me to assume,Providing_information
Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design ,Providing_information
i know  if this were Hell s Kitchen I pistonborediameter get gordon ramsay to yell at him lol,Providing_information
Not yet,Providing_information
wait can you explain again,Providing_information
and can it be lowered,Providing_information
me either,Providing_information
okay we have very good again,Providing_information
Okay,Providing_information
crankshaft has a mass of  28 ,Providing_information
I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts  I dont need them  factorofsafety  equals to   0   71  now,Providing_information
flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness yes,Providing_information
wait now we re very good,Providing_information
our weight is too high,Providing_information
our weight is too high,Providing_information
our weight is too high,Providing_information
it s very good right now,Providing_information
 This crankshaft is so broke I can hear it asking me for money ,Providing_information
Mass is at a min  factorofsafety is still about  4700 ,Providing_information
Great Work,Providing_information
Great Work,Providing_information
Great Work,Providing_information
Great Work,Providing_information
sweet ,Providing_information

I am not the one who ran it to get verygood,Providing_information
No one change anything,Providing_information
im at  60 ,Providing_information
its conrod,Providing_information
No one change anything,Providing_information
no one change anything,Providing_information
good,Providing_information
let s not change it,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
actually we should be getting excellent,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
what diameter should i use  i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of  97   5 ,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
hello,Providing_information
depends,Providing_information
i need to determine a piston diamter first because i think that is most important of my two variables,Providing_information
I don t think so,Providing_information
then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
Ok ,Providing_information
no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
no i do not,Providing_information
im tryin g 90  mm,Providing_information
im trying  90  mm,Providing_information
No i do not ,Providing_information
rn i have a  90  mm diameter,Providing_information
My apologies  Plots were not showing up for me originally  I mass on it,Providing_information
no worries,Providing_information
I have the piston bore diameter set to  47   5  currently,Providing_information
I am doing that now  Thanks for the help ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
Im using   8  and   55  for r 2  and r 3 ,Providing_information
increase factorofsafety decrease mass of the connecting rod,Providing_information
i mass focusing on minimizing thickness primarily,Providing_information
thats the most central point in my simulation,Providing_information
I have piston-pin length and piston pin diameter  so let me know if youd like me to change any of those values,Providing_information
increasing it will increase the force on the connecting rod,Providing_information
All my sims seem to have it at  40  rn,Providing_information
Definitely ,Providing_information
I am in charge of diameter and piston head thickness  Increasing diameter will increase the area  so more force  but also increase mass  Increasing head thickness will increase mass but also factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok one sec,Providing_information
nobody change anythibn,Providing_information
I currently have pistonborediameter set at  40 ,Providing_information
dont change anyhting,Providing_information
So far  the  90 mm looked better than the  97   5 mm,Providing_information
dont change anything,Providing_information
dont change anyhting,Providing_information
basically all i can do is increase mass of the connecting and therefore increase facotr of safety,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
I mass not sure how this works tbh haha,Providing_information
we are at very good,Providing_information
we are at very good,Providing_information
we are at very good,Providing_information
we are at very good,Providing_information
It just updated,Providing_information
it just said very good,Providing_information
It looks like im better off with a smaller piston diamter if you can make that work,Providing_information
So I mass trying to pick values of pistonborediameter and tH that will minimize mass and maximize factorofsafety  but I know pistonborediameter also interacts with Force,Providing_information
tandy,Providing_information
Ok  it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i mass gonna make the piston smaller to change that,Providing_information
yeah it does now,Providing_information
it said very good but someone changed someting,Providing_information
more mass,Providing_information
i increased the diameter to improve the factor of safety  I can reduce it if we want to try it out,Providing_information
I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used,Providing_information
For sure ,Providing_information
I agree  I also can change the Piston head thickness ,Providing_information
Sounds good  I ll try to decrease shaft mass,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
We need to decrease mass a lot,Providing_information
mine is showing as poor right now,Providing_information
We need to decrease mass a lot,Providing_information
Yes  I want to minimize mass but also don t want the piston head to fail,Providing_information
We need to decrease mass a lot,Providing_information
We need to decrease mass a lot,Providing_information
i saw a very good for a second but its gone now,Providing_information
at this point  just piston diameter,Providing_information
mainly because mass,Providing_information
my part doesnt effect mass very much,Providing_information
I haven t touched anything for a while,Providing_information
ok ,Providing_information
My part is at the lowest mass possible currently,Providing_information
I don t think that affects my design at all but that might reduce some mass,Providing_information
Minimize mass of connecting rod and maximize factor of safety against yielding due to buckling ,Providing_information
I can also change tH,Providing_information
changed piston back to  40  mm,Providing_information
I reduced mine to the lowest value  and our factorofsafety is good now,Providing_information
Me too,Providing_information
I put mine to initial values and the factorofsafety is good now,Providing_information
Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent ,Providing_information
tH doesn t effect me  can you try decreasing pistonborediameter,Providing_information
Im at the lowest possible on my sim list,Providing_information
Lost a great deal on factorofsafety ,Providing_information
Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is good just decrease mass,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
 2   31  to  25   99 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is good just decrease mass,Providing_information
that s okay  factorofsafety is still close to  2 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is good just decrease mass,Providing_information
If I increase flywheel the thickness  and diameter  the mass increases  but the factorofsafety decreases ,Providing_information
I need to find two fitting ratios  r 2  and r 3   As these are increased  the both the mass and factorofsafety decrease,Providing_information
I don t have control over any diameters,Providing_information
factorofsafety is good just decrease mass,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is the lowest at  2   03   so you can probably make it even smaller if possible,Providing_information
rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Providing_information
I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers ,Providing_information
rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Providing_information
I ve changed to the lowest mass acceptable for fs  greater than   2  for the piston,Providing_information
I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers ,Providing_information
gotcha  I put mine at the lowest value to check it and the factorofsafety is good now,Providing_information
rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Providing_information
bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
I can control t 1  and r 1   let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers ,Providing_information
mine is  2   09 ,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is also  2   09 ,Providing_information
thats a double negative then right  Can you see the power components  I know we have to satisfy minimums for some specs,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  flywheeldiameter  and flywheelthickness,Providing_information
gotcha  my factorofsafety stays realtivcly high with low mass so I shouldn t have too mcuh effect on overall weight,Providing_information
it is the smallest it can be,Providing_information
i have  2   7  factorofsafety and  57  mass,Providing_information
It s the smae tradeoff for everyone,Providing_information
we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass,Providing_information
Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent ,Providing_information
we are very close to gettin gabove factorofsafety  equals to  2    but see if you have any combinations that have a factorofsafety right above  2  but the lowest possibole mass,Providing_information

frick my mass is  57 ,Providing_information
whats the lightest you can go with fs  greater than   2 ,Providing_information
It s the same tradeoff for everyone,Providing_information
i am interested in the crankshaft bearing offset by another designer,Providing_information
okay I don t need either of those in my analysis,Providing_information
I have an factorofsafety of  1   45  now  I ll try increasing the diameter,Providing_information
and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter,Providing_information
I have t 1   L  and r,Providing_information
Makes sense  the connecting rod probably has more impact on factorofsafety than mass,Providing_information
That effects me as well,Providing_information
yeah thats the totla,Providing_information
It s the same tradeoff for everyone,Providing_information
Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds ,Providing_information
the closest factorofsafety I have above  2  is  3   78   I ll try broadcasting it,Providing_information
it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at  2   03   so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety  that would be ideal,Providing_information
minimum mass that has factorofsafety  greater than   2 ,Providing_information
ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter,Providing_information
My factorofsafety is around  2   Some parts may just have different ranges,Providing_information
I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs  greater than   2  design ,Providing_information

yeah thats what i did,Providing_information
no i don t think so,Providing_information
I don t think so,Providing_information
I just changed my factorofsafety to  3   78  but a higher mass  That s the closest I have to  2   09 ,Providing_information
Since the lowest of my designs is like  140   I mass going to prioritize mass reduction,Providing_information
Ye i think so  mine for just my part is  3   84 ,Providing_information
interesting,Providing_information
Yes  that s the goal,Providing_information
Im on mine rn with  0   1 ,Providing_information
my part mass is  6   5  and my factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Providing_information
jk u did,Providing_information
for flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and stuff,Providing_information
it doesnt have to be that high,Providing_information
doing that now,Providing_information
my factors of safety are around  0   5 - 3 ,Providing_information
just barely above  2 ,Providing_information
I think smaller,Providing_information

 12  for flywheelthickness and  60  for flywheeldiameter  my foss shows it at  12708   83  which makes no sense to me,Providing_information
I mass trying differetn combos  but its weird,Providing_information
That s literally the lowest value i have that s above  2  though,Providing_information
Since the lowest of my designs is like  140   I mass going to prioritize mass reduction,Providing_information

my foss is  12708   83  which makes no sense to me,Providing_information
yes both do,Providing_information
are your masses high,Providing_information
that cant be right,Providing_information
and crank pin diameter,Providing_information
I have lowest mass output selected currently,Providing_information
exactly,Providing_information
I decreased it to  82   5 ,Providing_information
I have lowest mass output selected currently,Providing_information
i don t think either of those affect me,Providing_information
I have lowest mass output selected currently,Providing_information
I have lowest mass output selected currently,Providing_information
yes  that was what I was thinking,Providing_information
yeah thats weird,Providing_information
Its now at  82   5 ,Providing_information

I ll send a message too see if they ll respond,Providing_information
I ll prioritize on increasing factorofsafety,Providing_information

yep just did it,Providing_information
with piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  150   flywheel  12  and shaft  60   we have a factorofsafety   12  above  2   but our mass is just a little high,Providing_information

cool,Providing_information
Will do,Providing_information
we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass,Providing_information
I think there is but I don t know how ,Providing_information

 0   57 ,Providing_information
I think that is a good idea,Providing_information
okay cool everyone responded,Providing_information
for the crankshaft,Providing_information
okay cool everyone responded,Providing_information
okay cool everyone responded,Providing_information
okay cool everyone responded,Providing_information
My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help,Providing_information
terrible,Providing_information
Lowering the diameter increases my factorofsafety by about  4  and increases mass by about  1 kg,Providing_information
right now my mass is at   69  and my factorofsafety is  3   84 ,Providing_information
my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 ,Providing_information

my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 ,Providing_information
Definitely keep it smaller rather than larger,Providing_information
I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages ,Providing_information
yes  i think so,Providing_information
 0   1  to  3   24  for mass   1   72  to  54   23  for factorofsafety ,Providing_information
i have to choose the heaviest part now,Providing_information
yes  let s do one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
or else the factorofsafety is very low,Providing_information
let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
great,Providing_information
hahaha,Providing_information
let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
let s change one component each  keep the mass within   5  kg of the lowest value  and try to maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
like one part has huge factorofsafety so they just minimized mass bc the part has factorofsafety over  100  no matter what option they choose,Providing_information
yeah that sounds like a good plan,Providing_information
will do,Providing_information
pass it on,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
Mass increases  but only by about  1 kg at most and factorofsafety increases by about  4 ,Providing_information
masses go from around  1  to  4 ,Providing_information
The conrod asked me to change it to see how it affects the numbers  I think  82   5  will be the best,Providing_information
I ve been talking with flywheel and he has very high mass ranges,Providing_information
factorofsafety like   5  to  4 ,Providing_information
The value I mass at now is the lowest it can be without going below  1   5   As the crank lenght is changed  my values change though,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
my masses are very small  and factorofsafety are  0   4 - 3   44 ,Providing_information
on it,Providing_information
The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 ,Providing_information
nice  mine is a lower pistonborediameter gives lower mass and factorofsafety doesnt rly change,Providing_information
The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 ,Providing_information
I think the  82   5  is the best  let me know when you are okay for me to change it back ,Providing_information
its actually at the minimum,Providing_information
Ok great,Providing_information
or like a mix since both my variable are pretty influential,Providing_information
I changed my factorofsafety to around  30  by adding  0   07  kg,Providing_information
okay  so let s try to get a high factorofsafety  as flywheel has huge masses  and they well work on mass reduction,Providing_information
check,Providing_information
The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 ,Providing_information
and we ve reached the global requirements,Providing_information
The one I picked was  0   55  kg  with the lowest at  0   52  kg  but the factorofsafety is  5   625 ,Providing_information
Sorry  t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length ,Providing_information
I know its weird,Providing_information
okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well,Providing_information
Pick a threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Providing_information
okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well,Providing_information
okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well,Providing_information
okay so everyone did that  but we are still not doing too well,Providing_information
go back to what you had bc we were at very good,Providing_information
oh nvm,Providing_information
I mass thinking larger pistonborediameter makes my part heavier,Providing_information
Same happened to me a bit ago,Providing_information
my part is a lot of the total weight,Providing_information
ith piston pistonborediameter  equals to   75   bearing  187   5   flywheel  12  and shaft  40   we have a factorofsafety below  2   but our mass is good  we were fair,Providing_information
ill try decreasing my mass slightly,Providing_information

Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Providing_information
I ve had it at the first one  but it says you may need my thickness to change,Providing_information
my masss is  6   28 ,Providing_information
i havent changed anything,Providing_information
and i have leeway with my factor of safety,Providing_information
Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Providing_information
Alright  b bearingoffset we have the given parameter LDr  equals to   1   2  and I have control of pistonborediameter,Providing_information
I can lower it to  75 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is  2   85 ,Providing_information
Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Providing_information
oh okay  sounds good,Providing_information
Yes  mass minimization is quite useless on my end  as my values are  0   02  -  0   12 ,Providing_information

We just hit very good,Providing_information
we are at excellent,Providing_information
factorofsafety optimization would be best  Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low factorofsafety,Providing_information
we are doing well right now,Providing_information

 75 - 105 ,Providing_information
lowest mass I meant,Providing_information
Okay  I think I have control of L and r ,Providing_information
i did it  Looks a little closer but not quite there,Providing_information
enough money for me,Providing_information
we are at very good right now,Providing_information
 75  gives me  2   6 kg and  8   08 factorofsafety which I think is pretty good,Providing_information
i dont want to mess it up,Providing_information
ayyyyyy,Providing_information
nvm looks good,Providing_information
factorofsafety is bad,Providing_information
I have the  2 nd lowest possible mass selected for my part,Providing_information
did it  we need to drop mass more still,Providing_information
as their ranges are also pretty small,Providing_information
I can hold mine above  2  and reduce but me having a high factorofsafety might brign the overall up for not much more mass,Providing_information
ok  Im just trying to figure out how it all works together  I was talking with someone else and sometimes when I optimize my part it hurts the overall system,Providing_information
it doesnt impact it much  and my part is low mass so if i have to change it  that wont be a big deal,Providing_information
yeah i have the same questionb,Providing_information
its bleow  40  and above  2 ,Providing_information
Rolid  really solid,Providing_information
i have a really small mass  so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options,Providing_information

i don t believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all,Providing_information
yo we got excellent,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
yo we got excellent,Providing_information
yo we got excellent,Providing_information
IT HAS US AT EXCELLENT NOW,Providing_information
increases factorofsafety and mass,Providing_information
like my factorofsafety just went from  1   9  to  2   2  without me changin anything for my part,Providing_information
goal weight is actually  35 ,Providing_information
they updated it,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
 ;  ,Providing_information
i can get my mass between  0   5  and  0   6   and still have a pretty high factorofsafety,Providing_information
hell yeah,Providing_information
goal weight is actually  35 ,Providing_information
goal weight is actually  35 ,Providing_information
at excellent so dont change anything,Providing_information
it went down,Providing_information
goal weight is actually  35 ,Providing_information
Keep it steady we got excellent,Providing_information

excellent,Providing_information
Keep it steady we got excellent,Providing_information
we are at excellent now,Providing_information
Keep it steady we got excellent,Providing_information
We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass ,Providing_information
right now its  0   1  but it ranges from  0   01  to  0   1 ,Providing_information
We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass ,Providing_information
just  0   12 ,Providing_information
excellent,Providing_information
We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass ,Providing_information
I think we are done,Providing_information
We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass ,Providing_information
me too,Providing_information
I will try that,Providing_information
if you drop weight and i up the pin  we might still be ok,Providing_information
I think we are good,Providing_information
ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
record your current value,Providing_information

sweeeeeet,Providing_information
unless it drastically changes the mass,Providing_information
ill ask,Providing_information
we got it ,Providing_information
just wait it out,Providing_information
we got it ,Providing_information
we got it ,Providing_information
we got it ,Providing_information
we have fair now,Providing_information
idk,Providing_information
nice fair ,Providing_information
Sure ,Providing_information
Fair ,Providing_information
Fair ,Providing_information
nice ,Providing_information
someone changed thier mass,Providing_information
someone change thier mass,Providing_information
I could try,Providing_information
someone changed thier mass,Providing_information
i just reduced my mass,Providing_information
mass,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
I didn ; t change,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
not me,Providing_information
i didnt move,Providing_information
wait we re at very good,Providing_information
wait we re at very good,Providing_information
i didnt,Providing_information
wait we re at very good,Providing_information
I don t know,Providing_information
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Providing_information
No I didn t,Providing_information
wait we re at very good,Providing_information
idk i didnt change,Providing_information
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Providing_information
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Providing_information
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Providing_information
or reduced offset i should say,Providing_information
okay it shows us at very good  not excellent,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down,Providing_information
I haven t changed anything,Providing_information
PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
the mass went up,Providing_information
PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
PIck the lowest mass over an factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
i dont htink piston did either,Providing_information
just leave it im fine with very good,Providing_information
just leave it im fine with very good,Providing_information
just leave it im fine with very good,Providing_information
no just leave it im fine with very good,Providing_information
i didnt touvch anything,Providing_information
Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better factorofsafety,Providing_information
i asked,Providing_information
we were at excellent but now its very good,Providing_information
well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor,Providing_information
well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor,Providing_information
ive been at the first broadcast for a while now,Providing_information
well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor,Providing_information
well hold up  someone just pushed us back to Poor,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
just did,Providing_information
My factorofsafety went down I think ,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
mine still says fair,Providing_information
idk ,Providing_information
okay well we were at excellent and the other guys swear they didn t change anything lol,Providing_information
nah,Providing_information
im not changing anything ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
I didn t  and neither did crankshaft  I think flywheel did,Providing_information
didnt touch anything,Providing_information
i changed nothing,Providing_information
i changed nothing,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
same  i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow,Providing_information
I haven t touched anything,Providing_information
anything above a diamter of  47  gives me very low factorofsafety,Providing_information
I changed mine back,Providing_information
i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow,Providing_information
Ok  that s odd,Providing_information
Ok  that s odd,Providing_information
i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow,Providing_information
I think tyhe  47   5  produced better results,Providing_information
Ok  that s odd,Providing_information
Ok  that s odd,Providing_information
i have no clue whats happening with that  my mass is too low to have an impact,Providing_information
Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move,Providing_information
Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move,Providing_information
Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move,Providing_information
 2   85 ,Providing_information
Fair  okay hold on  plenty of time to plan out the next move,Providing_information
 3   91 ,Providing_information
I think so too,Providing_information
It should be our lowest factorofsafety  but it s  0   51  instead of  2 ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
This is strange,Providing_information
Yeah we just need mass to go down,Providing_information
yeah its fine i jsut want   17 ,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is over  4000 ,Providing_information
i will stick with  47 ,Providing_information
my mass is  1   12 ,Providing_information
just kidding  back to poor ,Providing_information
its too low to have the impact it is having,Providing_information
just kidding  back to poor ,Providing_information
just kidding  back to poor ,Providing_information
just kidding  back to poor ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
i ll look and see if there are any,Providing_information
 2   06 ,Providing_information
ok youre the minimum,Providing_information
Global requirements top of page,Providing_information
It was good for a second  what happened,Providing_information
i see mine hadnt updated yet,Providing_information
yes  they are active,Providing_information
the one i mass at now is the best one there is on the list,Providing_information
when i try to bump factorofsafety up it moves us from very good to good so im leaving it,Providing_information
so it looks like my max factorofsafety is  1   23  with  47 ,Providing_information
my lowest factorofsafety is over  4000   crankshaft is the only person I would have to talk to ,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
no ive checked,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
who moved we are at poor now,Providing_information
you could try increasing pistonborediameter a little and see what happens overall,Providing_information
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2 ,Providing_information
im so confused what happened,Providing_information
 3   62 ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Providing_information
no idea  our mass is way too high and factorofsafety too low,Providing_information
I can decrease my mass by   19 kg but that brings my factorofsafety down  1   49 ,Providing_information
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Providing_information
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Providing_information
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Providing_information
Mine is still same,Providing_information
I pistonborediameter like to keep it at  47  since that help connecting rod,Providing_information
wut,Providing_information
nah dont do that,Providing_information
says very good still,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
i can increase my mass by increasing thickness,Providing_information
its fine now,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
by about   7  or  1 ,Providing_information
it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something,Providing_information
I told everyone that  but I think connector tod and piston pin guys left,Providing_information
I am staying at mass  0   07  and fs  1   23 ,Providing_information
update back to very good,Providing_information
alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
We need an factorofsafety of  1   5 ,Providing_information
that s a requirement,Providing_information
Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety,Providing_information
 2  is for expecially good design,Providing_information
it costs money,Providing_information
my highest factorofsafety is  1   23 ,Providing_information
 1   23  is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter,Providing_information
okay mine is  3   84 ,Providing_information
Mine still says fair  mass equals to  2   96   factorofsafety equals to  1   73   I can increase mass by  0   28   but increase factorofsafety by  2   63   Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least   28  tho,Providing_information

someones has to be that   5  though right,Providing_information
im at  1   23  factorofsafety as well and cant get above that unless we change piston diamter to  40 ,Providing_information
 1   23 ,Providing_information
That makes no sense,Providing_information
that s the highest,Providing_information
 3   03 ,Providing_information
 1   14 ,Providing_information
nevermind I mass being stupid,Providing_information
my mass is minimized rn,Providing_information
bad ok dont do that,Providing_information
yeah ,Providing_information
i think ive optimized my part,Providing_information
bueno,Providing_information
we reached good,Providing_information
piston pin has theirs at  1   23  and says that s their highest option,Providing_information
yep raised it,Providing_information
hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by   28 ,Providing_information
we reached good,Providing_information
itll say your current mass  find the one thats  3  kg lower and then find the factorofsafety,Providing_information
GOOD,Providing_information
WE are GOOD,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Providing_information
We are GOOD,Providing_information
GOOD ,Providing_information
With  0   12  mass ,Providing_information
me too,Providing_information
GOOD ,Providing_information
GOOD,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
we re at good,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
our mass is the only thing to change now,Providing_information
i drop to   97  factorofsafety,Providing_information
I say we stop changing,Providing_information
nobody touch anything haha,Providing_information
ok dont do that,Providing_information
so i dont want to change,Providing_information
nobody touch anything haha,Providing_information
I have  3   03  with mass of  0   12  ,Providing_information
nobody touch anything haha,Providing_information
cool  not touching anything,Providing_information
nobody touch anything haha,Providing_information
No,Providing_information
oh dang,Providing_information
No we re not good,Providing_information
cool  not touching anything,Providing_information
I think  75  is the best right now,Providing_information
cool  not touching anything,Providing_information
if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an factorofsafety of over  2  that chould do it,Providing_information
I have factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  with mass  equals to   0   12  ,Providing_information
HEllo,Providing_information
nvmd,Providing_information
cool  not touching anything,Providing_information
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Providing_information
refresh it,Providing_information
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Providing_information
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Providing_information
Rod designer still here,Providing_information
i agree haha,Providing_information
Only change something if it will lower mass and keep fs greater than  2 ,Providing_information
so nevermind haha,Providing_information
as someone changes their values  all other fvalues are forced to change,Providing_information
 2   06  right,Providing_information
or maybe two or three are tied,Providing_information
Yeah that s what im trying to find out,Providing_information
my individual factorofsafety is in the range of  2000   not sure how to compare that to  2 factorofsafety on a system wide level,Providing_information
I don t think any of them will be high enough if I drop any mass,Providing_information
but we have a good design,Providing_information
sorry I was distracted by other teammates ,Providing_information
all good,Providing_information
 2   03 factorofsafety is about the factorofsafety we can do and still be very good   excellent  we need to drop the mass,Providing_information

The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know,Providing_information
whaddup,Providing_information
wassup,Providing_information
hi,Providing_information
yo bro,Providing_information
we gotta talk,Providing_information
piston- pin designer,Providing_information
I chose a t _ f  equals to   12   0  and pistonborediameter _ s  equals to   60   0 ,Providing_information
The piston can be any value between  3  and  15 kg,Providing_information
Im working on the connecting rod  Honestly just trying to figure out how to start,Providing_information
ive got you at  75 ,Providing_information
i mass trying to minimize the mass of crankshaft and factor of safety,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to  150 ,Providing_information
i determine bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
sure,Providing_information
yeah the pin is pretty light  shouldnt be an issue,Providing_information
Im working on the piston,Providing_information
trying to max factorofsafety and min weight,Providing_information
trying to max factorofsafety and min weight,Providing_information
kk ill test,Providing_information
trying to max factorofsafety and min weight of the piston,Providing_information
we are  1   94  over mass rn,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
we are  1   94  over mass rn,Providing_information
we are  1   94  over mass rn,Providing_information
honestly the best bet for me would be a factorofsafety of above two and make the smallest weight possible,Providing_information
my stats for flywheel are as follow,Providing_information
my graphs don t show up so i mass somewhat limited,Providing_information
we are  1   94  over mass rn,Providing_information
The highest performance is at  3   91  factorofsafety and  5   2 mass,Providing_information
t _ f  equals to   12   0  and pistonborediameter _ s  equals to   60   0 ,Providing_information
yea I can lower the mass of the piston  I have it set at  8   84 kg right now,Providing_information
its t _ h  equals to   4  and pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Providing_information
mass  equals to   1   27  and f _ os  equals to   15886   04 ,Providing_information
i have mass for the shaft at  18   63   fs equals to  2   06 ,Providing_information
mine also,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Providing_information
updated my mass to  1   19 ,Providing_information
updated my mass to  1   19 ,Providing_information
we at very good rn im happy with that,Providing_information
f _ os  equals to   9193   31 ,Providing_information
yes  i design the bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
we at very good rn im happy with that,Providing_information
f _ os  equals to   9193   31 ,Providing_information
f _ os  equals to   9193   31 ,Providing_information
we at very good rn im happy with that,Providing_information
mass  equals to   1   19 ,Providing_information
we at very good rn im happy with that,Providing_information
we can tone it down some still,Providing_information
I dont believe so,Providing_information
we can tone it down some still,Providing_information
trying to max factorofsafety and min weight,Providing_information
my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
we can tone it down some still,Providing_information
cool,Providing_information
yea what we have right now is perfect,Providing_information
duh,Providing_information
my current bearingoffset i  150  and dc of  30 ,Providing_information
lets try only small changes now since we are at very good  maybe make it to excellent,Providing_information
 60  ia the current value,Providing_information
can try small changes,Providing_information
I mass trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod,Providing_information
if we could take off  2  kgs wed be golden,Providing_information
we are very good,Providing_information
helloooo,Providing_information
I mass trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod,Providing_information
ok just making sure it updates,Providing_information
At  75  diameter for me  the best I have is  2   85 factorofsafety and  6   26 mass,Providing_information
yea my bad  I ve got  7   15 kg right now,Providing_information
we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs,Providing_information
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Providing_information
piston diameter  pistonborediameter  is currently  105   not variable I control,Providing_information
since we are at the threshold for fs,Providing_information
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Providing_information
minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Providing_information
i mass determining dc and bearingoffset,Providing_information
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Providing_information
I haven t changed anything yet,Providing_information
my bad  thanks,Providing_information
Hello I currently am discussing with a  75  diameter piston,Providing_information
 2   31 ,Providing_information
there is a default one but i mass trying to figure out how to change it,Providing_information
minimize the weight of crankshaft and increase factorofsafety,Providing_information
yea  idk who changed a value  If we cant figure it out  I can lower the piston  4  pounds,Providing_information
kg,Providing_information
i mass determining bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
I didn t change,Providing_information
 40  inches ,Providing_information
Im not sure  the only thing that effects me is the bore diameter,Providing_information
thanks,Providing_information
ok will do,Providing_information
 18   63 ,Providing_information
ok back to very good i say leabe it,Providing_information
Crankshaft bearing offset,Providing_information
ok guys looks good,Providing_information
I have broadcasted the best value,Providing_information
ok guys looks good,Providing_information
ok back to very good i say leabe it,Providing_information
I can chang the diameter,Providing_information
ok guys looks good,Providing_information
I have broadcasted the best value,Providing_information
ok back to very good i say leabe it,Providing_information
ok guys looks good,Providing_information
ok back to very good i say leabe it,Providing_information
I have broadcasted the best value,Providing_information
I have broadcasted the best value,Providing_information
we got it,Providing_information
ok thats not me then  maybe ask around,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
flywheeldiameter flywheelthickness and pistonborediameter,Providing_information
and t _ h  which may be the length,Providing_information
we re at excellent,Providing_information
The piston has a diameter of  75 ,Providing_information
exellent dont touch,Providing_information
Yeah I mass talking to the crankshaft,Providing_information
exellent dont toucu,Providing_information
awesome,Providing_information
yuppppp,Providing_information
or we were for a second,Providing_information
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Providing_information
ok I change pistonborediameter right now its still  75 ,Providing_information
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Providing_information
and a tH of  10   5 ,Providing_information
I have not selected anything yet  Still looking through my options,Providing_information
bearingoffset is bearing support offset,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
dc is crank-pin diameter,Providing_information
 40  inches currently,Providing_information
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Providing_information
i mass having the best value now,Providing_information
alright we re at very good  I say lets leave it at this,Providing_information
and flywheel thickness,Providing_information
ayyy the status is good somehow,Providing_information
we just had excellent but someone touched it,Providing_information
we need to decrease the mass,Providing_information
we need to decrease the mass,Providing_information
we need to decrease the mass,Providing_information
we need to decrease the mass,Providing_information
We re at very good  I say we leave it at this,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
we got excellent,Providing_information
Actually its better now,Providing_information
Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now,Providing_information
we got excellent,Providing_information
Yeah  Im on the second lightest option,Providing_information
Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now,Providing_information
Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now,Providing_information
we got excellent,Providing_information
the mass of the piston is currently  2   23 ,Providing_information
Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now,Providing_information
we got excellent,Providing_information
For the flywheel shaft diameter i have  10 ,Providing_information
Yeah,Providing_information
I can change diameter if needed,Providing_information
sweet we re at excellent,Providing_information
Its excellent now,Providing_information
Yeah,Providing_information
ranges from 0   45  to  4   43 ,Providing_information
For the diameter it is  25  right now,Providing_information
yea we re at excellent,Providing_information
cool we should be good then,Providing_information
Sweet we re at excellent quality rn,Providing_information
cool,Providing_information
I mass on the lightest option  but if I go up at all we ll go over  3 ,Providing_information
Ok  mine is only   5   Idk how factorofsafety works but mine goes above  5 k,Providing_information
perfect  thank you,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
I can try lower mass  however pistonborediameter will need to increase to compensate for the reduced factorofsafety,Providing_information
lmk what you think,Providing_information
lmk what you think,Providing_information
lmk what you think,Providing_information
great  done then,Providing_information
great  done then,Providing_information
great  done then,Providing_information
no problem,Providing_information
We can make that happen,Providing_information
factorofsafety should be around  5  for everyone  Making it larger doesn t seem to help the sub-system factorofsafety,Providing_information
I think were good  We are at the highest point we can be  Good job ,Providing_information
haha good can t wait to go work on this lab,Providing_information
awesome  go team,Providing_information
pistom-pin designer says increase the diameter,Providing_information
gotta love it,Providing_information
 however pistonborediameter will need to increase to compensate for the reduced factorofsafety ,Providing_information
cool,Providing_information
i havent really started yet,Providing_information
the bearingoffset and dc i currently have yields best factorofsafety which is  2   283  but it s not the lightest,Providing_information
mine only goes up to  30  max,Providing_information
I dont think those effect my design  Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else,Providing_information
thats fine we already have the highest rating with an acceptable factorofsafety,Providing_information
I spent a lot of time staring at it questioning my basic knowledge of engineering so I pistonborediameter recommend starting haha,Providing_information
i could change so that it have factorofsafety of  2  but weights  2  kg lighter,Providing_information
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
ive got a factorofsafety of  3   91   lets see if we can get it further above  2 ,Providing_information
check with the others,Providing_information
for my component,Providing_information
The weight will go over if I increase diameter,Providing_information
Higher offset lowers my factorofsafety a lot just fyi,Providing_information
weight let me update my design,Providing_information
i haven t updated,Providing_information
pretty good  how about yourself,Providing_information
wait ,Providing_information
Not too bad  not excited for the lab,Providing_information
i updated,Providing_information
Don t worry  you re a pistonpin you can do anything,Providing_information
i updated my design,Providing_information
If i increase diameter we go over weight  Still on lowest setting,Providing_information
ok so your mass should be fine  not a big contributing factor,Providing_information
it got worse so i would change it back,Providing_information
i think we should just leave it,Providing_information
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter  I got these values by setting pistonborediameter  equals to   45 ,Providing_information
ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve factorofsafety some with other parts,Providing_information
Someone just changed something,Providing_information
i didnt change anything,Providing_information
If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit,Providing_information
dont change it theyre changing it back,Providing_information
Ok  60  is my lowest possible so I ll leave it at that,Providing_information
  45 - 5 ,Providing_information
I haven t touched any,Providing_information
me neither  poor now,Providing_information
woah were at poor now,Providing_information
Wait we ve gone down to poor quality now,Providing_information
I mass on  0   69  now with a factorofsafety of  3   84 ,Providing_information
yeah  I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can,Providing_information
now poor,Providing_information
well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more,Providing_information
the one we currently have is the default,Providing_information
keep your values from the max score we got the other guy will fix it,Providing_information
the factorofsafety is quit low,Providing_information
I have not,Providing_information
Yeah I won t,Providing_information
I didnt,Providing_information
Crankshaft asked for bore diameter  Thats all,Providing_information
I have piston diameter,Providing_information
i didnt change,Providing_information
pistonborediameter equals to   47   4  or  40  for me,Providing_information
ok good  I would just assume your part has the most mass,Providing_information
it s poor again lol,Providing_information
I mass using  47   5 ,Providing_information
rn is very,Providing_information
very good,Providing_information
right now,Providing_information
Yeah we were at excellent but we ve gone back down to poor now somehow,Providing_information
We need to save weight ,Providing_information
I had it at mass  equals to   0   04  and f  equals to   0   74  when the status of the engine was good,Providing_information
we had excelent at one point,Providing_information
i updated another design,Providing_information
No  I only have one good value  No experimentation required,Providing_information
My mass range is around  0   02  to   12 ,Providing_information
I got good results with  55   but trying to bring down the mass,Providing_information
Will do I wrote them down,Providing_information
I have not chnaged anything,Providing_information
I mass looking for the lowest mass with highest factorofsafety right now,Providing_information
 47   5 ,Providing_information
great,Providing_information
then it was not me,Providing_information
I agree,Providing_information
It wasn t me or the piston  Ive recorded my values in case something happens,Providing_information
ok i ll ask around,Providing_information
I havn t changed it since the beginning,Providing_information
 40   70 ,Providing_information
Yeah same here,Providing_information
I have lowest mass currently without making factorofsafety poor,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
The crankshaft changed something,Providing_information
nah i dont think that would change the varialbes for me,Providing_information
I dont believe so,Providing_information
ok mine is like   5 - 1  so im trying to change factorofsafety more,Providing_information
Nope must be the other two that need that,Providing_information
at some point  need to get mass down,Providing_information
my bad lol the range of mass is like  0     0   1  ish,Providing_information
He changed it and it went to very good,Providing_information
But it s back to poor now again,Providing_information
i did,Providing_information
I am not sure  haven t heard from fly wheel or crankshaft,Providing_information
 your,Providing_information
I imagine these would contribute to more mass,Providing_information
 your,Providing_information
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Providing_information
someone is changing stuff,Providing_information
I may change it back to  55  though if that works with yours ,Providing_information
not me,Providing_information
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Providing_information
hmm ok I ll check around,Providing_information
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Providing_information
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Providing_information
I didnt change anything,Providing_information
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Providing_information
at that  I can get mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  which are good values,Providing_information
no I am just refreshing,Providing_information
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Providing_information
just changed it to  25  pistonborediameter and t is  10 ,Providing_information
That s where it was when we got the result as good,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
Okay we are good now,Providing_information
sweet,Providing_information
nah,Providing_information
The conrod hasn t changed anything,Providing_information
bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 ,Providing_information
no I got my best value,Providing_information
 0   45  kg to  4   43 ,Providing_information
got em,Providing_information
The crankshaft designed is changing values,Providing_information
this is as good as i can get i think,Providing_information
 Good ,Providing_information
ok neither have i,Providing_information
i see that,Providing_information
ok yeah so really small  I was just wondering why mass was so high,Providing_information
this is as good as i can get,Providing_information
based on the current values  it should say excellent,Providing_information
yep ,Providing_information
oh damn mine is  0   0   06  when i put diameter as  50 ,Providing_information
based on the current values  it should say excellent,Providing_information
i mass trying to minimize weight while keeping factorofsafety around  2 ,Providing_information
based on the current values  it should say excellent,Providing_information
Okay let s keep it at that then,Providing_information
not me,Providing_information
based on the current values  it should say excellent,Providing_information
piston range is pretty high,Providing_information
bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness,Providing_information
 47   5 ,Providing_information
no we need mass below  35 ,Providing_information
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Providing_information
i was at t equals to  10  and pistonborediameter equals to  15  or  20 ,Providing_information
ok thx,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
my current value is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 ,Providing_information
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Providing_information
only one i use is bearingoffset,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
we are at  Good  now,Providing_information
Yeah they said they re not going to change it now,Providing_information
No I have not,Providing_information
nah its above  35 ,Providing_information
 18   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   06 ,Providing_information
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Providing_information
I am simply sitting here,Providing_information
I do the control flywheeldiameter but its the same,Providing_information
ok still at  60 ,Providing_information
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Providing_information
flywheeldiameter  equals to   50 ,Providing_information
crankshaft is talking  but he she depends on flywheel,Providing_information
me too,Providing_information
the highest factorofsafety rn for me is  0   89 ,Providing_information
that wasnt me,Providing_information
that wasnt me,Providing_information
no they remain the same,Providing_information
 37   46  and  2   06 ,Providing_information
that wasnt me,Providing_information
I think the flywheel is changing,Providing_information
that wasnt me,Providing_information
ok i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Providing_information
looks like mass dropped a lot,Providing_information
I have not touched mine,Providing_information
my second option is mass  equals to   20   55  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   83 ,Providing_information
I cant get a response tho,Providing_information
is flywheel talking greater than ,Providing_information
It just changed back to good,Providing_information
Talking with crankshaft since we need to coordinate on mass,Providing_information
I did and piston should be low now  rod is only a mass of   14 ,Providing_information
 37   49  kg and  2   06 ,Providing_information
damn,Providing_information
mass  1   83  and factorofsafety  1   92 ,Providing_information
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Providing_information
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Providing_information
Our mass keeps going up,Providing_information
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Providing_information
I have not changed mine,Providing_information
the plot on the white board,Providing_information
 4   42  and  10   19 ,Providing_information
probably,Providing_information
i meant for your part,Providing_information
factorofsafety greater than  2  and mass lesser than  35 ,Providing_information
ill try,Providing_information
gives excellent,Providing_information
I think the flywheel keeps changing values  I cant get a response tho,Providing_information
i wouldnt up your weight,Providing_information
the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get factorofsafety to like  0   89 ,Providing_information
 0   1 ,Providing_information
smallest,Providing_information
oh I see,Providing_information
i know  my design is basically fixed,Providing_information
I control tH and pistonborediameter of the piston,Providing_information
Yeah I don t know how ,Providing_information
Mass  5   2  factorofsafety  3   91 ,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
I mass at Mass  0   69  and factorofsafety  3   84   We need to find some more weight to up your factorofsafety,Providing_information
 47   5 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter back to  10  now because factorofsafety is high,Providing_information
oh there we go,Providing_information
the alternetives are either increase weight by a bunch or decrease factorofsafety by a lot,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
its the flywheel guy,Providing_information
Ok we re doing well  We re at good s,Providing_information
yeah i see that,Providing_information
its the flywheel guy,Providing_information
yeah for sure him,Providing_information
our weight is the high bit,Providing_information
very close now,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
For lower mass I could make it  40   it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn t affect factorofsafety as much,Providing_information
our weight is the high bit,Providing_information
our weight is the high bit,Providing_information
getting close,Providing_information
Increase your mass slightly,Providing_information
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Providing_information
Its the lowest mass with an factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
I think you re right,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
for my parts,Providing_information
We are going back up ,Providing_information
but were at v good,Providing_information
ok we re close,Providing_information
No  You have the lowest factorofsafety at  1   92  currently,Providing_information
ok we re close,Providing_information
okay can di,Providing_information
cool thats good,Providing_information
ok we re close,Providing_information
The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by  0   03 ,Providing_information
ok we re close,Providing_information
yes  we need to system wide reduce weight,Providing_information
I have the best broadcast available for my thing,Providing_information
TRUE,Providing_information
heloooo,Providing_information
large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better,Providing_information
large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better,Providing_information
mine is a diameter and i think it relates to piston,Providing_information
yea lets not change any more variables,Providing_information
large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better,Providing_information
we just had excellent for a bit so I was trying to see what we could better,Providing_information
large pistonborediameter helps me my mass is at   05   and my factorofsafety _ s is  2   03   not sure i can get much better,Providing_information
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Providing_information
try decreasing the weight while keeping factorofsafety the same,Providing_information
current mass is  0   01  with factorofsafety  0   1 ,Providing_information
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
 2   26  and  2   5 ,Providing_information
at  62   5  the mass goes up from  1   89  to  2   94 ,Providing_information
I changed factorofsafety but not the diamter,Providing_information
  53  and was   52 ,Providing_information
 1   62  kg,Providing_information
now we are at poor again ,Providing_information
my design is basically fixed  i found a good design that have decent factorofsafety but not too heavy,Providing_information
I am at my lowest mass possible,Providing_information
I am at my lowest mass possible,Providing_information
piston diameter,Providing_information
DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW,Providing_information
DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW,Providing_information
DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW,Providing_information
as i increase it I can increase factorofsafety some,Providing_information
DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW,Providing_information
decreasing mass is gonna decrease my factorofsafety,Providing_information
we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol,Providing_information
Increase,Providing_information
no  i got my best value now,Providing_information
we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol,Providing_information
we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol,Providing_information
very bad change,Providing_information
okay so the piston and I also have that variable and we have it at  47   5  currently,Providing_information
the only person changing values is the flywheel,Providing_information
 increaseing,Providing_information
your part,Providing_information
communication is key my brotha,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
yeah i just sent that to everyone,Providing_information
I ve just been clicking refresh for the last  20  minutes haha,Providing_information
bad change  not me,Providing_information
i guess it s the system messing with us lol,Providing_information
same lmao,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
we had excellent until someone changed it,Providing_information
Don t use a factorofsafety of higher than like  5 ,Providing_information
same and im currently there,Providing_information
 :  ,Providing_information
I haven t changed in  5  mins,Providing_information
the new design looks real good,Providing_information
I mass not sure what happened  but if you need me to change anything  let me know  From here all I can do is increase factorofsafety and mass  but we don t need that,Providing_information
shoot,Providing_information
 1   31 ,Providing_information
so close,Providing_information
 0   1 ,Providing_information
the new design looks real good,Providing_information
its the smallest I can go,Providing_information
it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
but no one changed anything i believe,Providing_information
I have my diameter set to  40   but that has likely changed since I last chacked,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
nope dont thing so,Providing_information
I think both of us are good,Providing_information
i have mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety at  1   23 ,Providing_information
if i go for a lower mass we don t pass the factorofsafety,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
Flywheel isn t communicating thats the problem,Providing_information
I know ,Providing_information
Yeah I tried decreasing the weight,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
oops sorry for the repeat,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
i have diameter at  47   5 with mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   23 ,Providing_information
to  150 ,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
no i don t need that,Providing_information
diameter pistonborediameter has been at  40  whole time,Providing_information
that is a lot  between you and the piston  you guys have the majority of the weight,Providing_information
the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values,Providing_information
mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   23 ,Providing_information
under variables of other subsystems,Providing_information
this is what i ahve rn,Providing_information
it is at  150 ,Providing_information
clarify flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness numbers,Providing_information
can you decrease the weight a bit maybe,Providing_information
lol sorry for the repeat,Providing_information
dc at  45 ,Providing_information
no nothing affects me,Providing_information
the systemwide weight is kinda high,Providing_information
that is the best I can get,Providing_information
if we could decrease for another  2  kg we should get excellent,Providing_information
I was testing the lower diameter for less mass  Changed it back now,Providing_information
thats getting better  Im working w the piston to find the best pistonborediameter and will let you konw when we do,Providing_information
mas is up pretty high,Providing_information
Yeah thats because our parts are heavy,Providing_information
I agree  I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent  I have not changed my variables  I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
thickness is  10 ,Providing_information
I cant decrease the weight without decreasing the facto of safety below  2 ,Providing_information
haha yea fingers crossed it stays at very good,Providing_information
No I mass using the crankshaft bearing offset,Providing_information
could you lower the mass by  2  kg without skrewing the factorofsafety,Providing_information
diameter is  25 ,Providing_information
I can reduce it by lowering diameter or thickness which lowers my factorofsafety,Providing_information
Yeah flywheel isn t communicating,Providing_information
I mass asking around,Providing_information
I mass at the  4 headthickness lowest weight I can be at out of  25  options,Providing_information
yes  pistonborediameter from  20  to  15 ,Providing_information
I choose the part with lowest mass and factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
not me  at lowest weight possible,Providing_information
 1   27 ,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
 1   36 ,Providing_information
i can get higher factorofsafety with relatively low mass so maybe we can leverage this,Providing_information
i mass asking around rn,Providing_information
I cant,Providing_information
ok cool,Providing_information
try to find a combo that gets you just above  2  factorofsafety but the lowest mass,Providing_information
I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking,Providing_information
ok sounds good,Providing_information
the weight increased for some reason,Providing_information
Oh ok  Because we went back to poor,Providing_information
 :   3   25  ;   :   40   0  ;   :   0   69  ;   :   3   84  ; ,Providing_information
flywheel no word at all,Providing_information
sitting at  2   77 ,Providing_information
Oh ok  Because we went back to poor,Providing_information
headthickness  pistonborediameter  mass  factorofsafety,Providing_information
We need to save weight,Providing_information
As long as your factorofsafety is above  2   try to find the lowest possible mass,Providing_information
omggg,Providing_information
yeah i have no clue,Providing_information
ok my mass is   53  and factorofsafety is  1929 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is too low now,Providing_information
i havent changed,Providing_information
thats good,Providing_information
ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else,Providing_information
I didn t change anything,Providing_information
ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else,Providing_information
Lower makes it worse,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Providing_information
getting close,Providing_information
ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else,Providing_information
mine is at  2   03   dont think i can make changes  unless there is a better combination that requires changes from all of us,Providing_information
pretty close now actually,Providing_information
ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work  If not Ill just change it back and we ll take Very Good  No one change anything else,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
alright yeah  I mass at lowest possible mass   0   1   and factorofsafety is  2   77 ,Providing_information
lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40   changing it to that,Providing_information
cool we are good,Providing_information
my factorofsafety s  is  9193   31 ,Providing_information
its just flywheel that is rich apparently and can afford to experiment,Providing_information
lowest mass is at pistonborediameter equals to  40   changing it to that,Providing_information
it s good now,Providing_information
only   7  away now,Providing_information
yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by   01  so probably not me,Providing_information
 3   91 factorofsafety  5   2 mass,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
 5   2 ,Providing_information
only   7  away from excellent,Providing_information
Ok yeah thats not you,Providing_information
i have factorofsafety at  3   23 ,Providing_information
that will increase my mass  which is where we are too high,Providing_information
I didn t change anything,Providing_information
were at good lets leave it,Providing_information
my mass is  3   13   the lowest option  and factorofsafety is  0   58 ,Providing_information
we re at good lets leave it,Providing_information
thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length,Providing_information
Okay,Providing_information
we re at good lets leave it,Providing_information
mass  equals to   0   12  with f at  3   44 ,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
we re at good lets leave it,Providing_information
 2   06 ,Providing_information
sure,Providing_information
Im fine with it,Providing_information
thickness equals to  2   ratio equals to  3 ,Providing_information
Yeah I think that s the best we can get,Providing_information
 1   75  and  6   07 ,Providing_information
ok ill leave then,Providing_information
mass factorofsafety,Providing_information
I mass fine with that,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around,Providing_information
rip too late,Providing_information
cut,Providing_information
it s my best option,Providing_information
We are good now,Providing_information
ok ill leave it then,Providing_information
my lowest factorofsafety is still  700   mass only goes down to   52  and its there,Providing_information
mass  1   97  factorofsafety  3   05 ,Providing_information
I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around,Providing_information
flyweel is good too,Providing_information
im good,Providing_information
time is up it says on my system,Providing_information
variable that affects my mass and factorofsafety is just diameter  so I ve been minimizing my  outputs  on that diameter,Providing_information
Piston pin too,Providing_information
if you can lower mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   try to,Providing_information
agreed,Providing_information
so close,Providing_information
I mass good too,Providing_information
I mass ending it,Providing_information
alright,Providing_information
i guess it s good,Providing_information
good work,Providing_information
good work,Providing_information
good work,Providing_information
good work,Providing_information
were good,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
Hi,Providing_information
sup,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
let s get this bread,Providing_information
 ,Providing_information
Try  15 ,Providing_information
aight bet,Providing_information
sorry  225  first,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
my connecting rod length  equals to   1  crank length ,Providing_information
so that seems too big,Providing_information
hi,Providing_information
waaaaait my bad,Providing_information
Not sure yet ,Providing_information
Not quite sure yet ,Providing_information
the equation of the ratio R 1   equals to   connector rod crank length ,Providing_information
ill go with a ratio of  4  so  900  for connector length,Providing_information
Yea  it s better to minimize bearingoffset,Providing_information
Just broadcasted it  I set pistonborediameter at  55 ,Providing_information
Just broadcasted it  I chose  55  for pistonborediameter,Providing_information
I have not been having a lot of luck  try something like  110 mm,Providing_information
Just broadcasted it  looks like  55  for pistonborediameter was a good choice,Providing_information
More than  2  is excellent,Providing_information
It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same  but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but factorofsafety is reduced,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
what I mass looking at is  60  and  12 ,Providing_information
yuh,Providing_information
so that makes it  600  for connector lenght,Providing_information
go with  90  for now,Providing_information
with a ratio of  4 ,Providing_information
Also I think a flywheelthickness value of  10  is best,Providing_information
go with  90 ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
 9   09 ,Providing_information
nah,Providing_information
The piston pin length  and the inner and outer diameter of the of the piston pin,Providing_information
 5625   56 ,Providing_information
 0   57 ,Providing_information
the broadcast still shows  40 ,Providing_information
Nvm I can see them,Providing_information
the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter,Providing_information
It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I mass doing something wrong,Providing_information
For the one I just ran I got  2   62 ,Providing_information
huh I would ask a TA then ,Providing_information
Yo,Providing_information
Yeah it keeps showing up as poor for me as well  Let me play with the piston some more  I was looking at the auto engine and didn t see how small our mass had to be,Providing_information
the other values on our team are like between  2   5  and  5000 ,Providing_information
 45 ,Providing_information
that was with r 2  at   5   r 3  at  7  and pistonborediameter at  40 ,Providing_information
the values I have broadcasted should generate max factorofsafety,Providing_information
i broadcasted the simulation for  12 mm for thickness and  60 mm for diameter,Providing_information
i can also cut weight but it will reduce factorofsafety,Providing_information
Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness,Providing_information
yeah we are less than  3  but the factorofsafety is still   59   yikes,Providing_information
Quality very good Nice ,Providing_information
Quality very good Nice ,Providing_information
Gotcha,Providing_information
Quality very good Nice ,Providing_information
try  65 ,Providing_information
crankshaft bearing offset,Providing_information
i made my connector rod to crank length ratio  4 ,Providing_information
 150 mm,Providing_information
so connector rod is  600 ,Providing_information
and thickness is  7   5 ,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
So  I can increase factorofsafety by alot but my part would weigh  so I could,Providing_information
Smallest number possible is best,Providing_information
I got factorofsafety  2  WITH  1   67  ms,Providing_information
ill try to run simulation more to see if there is any other cases that has bigger f,Providing_information
Will make it larger only if you need,Providing_information
It increases the mass a lot,Providing_information
we need smaller mass,Providing_information
we need smaller mass folks,Providing_information
Right now I have it broadcasted at  55 ,Providing_information
we need less mass folks,Providing_information
I made a design change to cut weight by   7  with similar factorofsafety,Providing_information
we need less mass folks,Providing_information
Global quality looking bad though,Providing_information
 150  is the lower bound ,Providing_information
we almost there,Providing_information
i dont think i have that as an input  Unless im missing something ,Providing_information
So I decreased weight  and kept same factorofsafety,Providing_information
negative,Providing_information
not much  my factorofsafety will decrease dramatically for a drop in  0   03  mass,Providing_information
i can do  40  easy,Providing_information
I mean factorofsafety only needs to be greater than  2 ,Providing_information
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Providing_information
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
So good news  turns out the rod thickness increase from  6   5  mm to  7  mm increased the factorofsafety by  0   23  but only increased the weight by  0   13  kg,Providing_information
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Providing_information
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Providing_information
i will see what i can do,Providing_information
Perfect,Providing_information
rad,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
lowest I could do is  75  for the weight,Providing_information
Cool,Providing_information
switched to  43 ,Providing_information
we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the amss,Providing_information
i have thickness of flywheel as  12 mm and  60 mm for shaft diameter,Providing_information
Cause we re still really high on weight,Providing_information
mass,Providing_information
pistonborediameter isn t controlled by me,Providing_information
  05  for mass,Providing_information
oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by  0   25 ,Providing_information
 2   03  for factorofsafety,Providing_information
Ok with the minimum mass  for the flywheel  factorofsafety is still  1215 ,Providing_information
we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the mass,Providing_information
Actually  that doesn t make any sense  since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is  150 mm  and your maximum flywheel thickness is  51 ,Providing_information
mm,Providing_information
use  43 mm shaft diameter  The crankshaft engineer gave me that value recently,Providing_information
factorofsafety is back i increased thickness,Providing_information
im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety,Providing_information
can get  2   62  factorofsafety with   01  extra mass,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
Yep,Providing_information
Thats great,Providing_information
yeah it can t be,Providing_information
Alright,Providing_information
Yeah the mass looks like a problem,Providing_information
No  i dont think so  I can only see my inputs and the piston bore diameter,Providing_information
The mass is our biggest issue,Providing_information
ms  equals to  6   72   factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
try going up by  1   try making it  41   42   43  ,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
I can only do  60 - 130 ,Providing_information
I am not sure,Providing_information
i switched it back to  45 ,Providing_information
ill try cut a bit of weight with flywheeldiameter,Providing_information
Sorry  60 ,Providing_information
we have our factorofsafety up  just need to reduce the mass,Providing_information
Yeah really,Providing_information
i think i will reach my ideal values in a second,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
 0   52 ,Providing_information
awesome,Providing_information
flywheelthickness value of  10 ,Providing_information
yeah  lowest i ve gotten with an factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   1215 ,Providing_information
I mass gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down,Providing_information
Good point   40  is the lower limit,Providing_information
it updates the global model,Providing_information
now it says  2   03 ,Providing_information
minimum mass and about  2   03  factorofsafety,Providing_information
increasing your the bearing offset only reduces the factorofsafety so im keeping it at  150 ,Providing_information
minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail,Providing_information
Broadcast the latest values,Providing_information
Broadcast the latest values,Providing_information
sure,Providing_information
Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness,Providing_information
yeah try that,Providing_information
just did ,Providing_information
 75  is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement,Providing_information
no  i mean  6   72 ,Providing_information
still  45 ,Providing_information
but I can slightly increase mass to get  2   63  factorofsafety,Providing_information
awesome,Providing_information
but  2   03  is good enough  we just gotta fix te weight now,Providing_information
 Select a design to broadcast ,Providing_information
that factorofsafety is good since your part is pretty small,Providing_information
  06  and  2   62 ,Providing_information
 5   82 ,Providing_information
I think it should be up,Providing_information
 0   1   2   77 ,Providing_information
makes sense  I mass checking with the others to see who is using the most mass,Providing_information
Okay  great,Providing_information
Im using the minimum possible values and cant change much more,Providing_information
I see it,Providing_information
Kind of  increasing thickness increases factorofsafety,Providing_information
uh  piston guy says pistonborediameter  equals to   40 ,Providing_information
In my simulation I increased Tf to  51   It brought the factorofsafety down ever so slightly  but brought down the mass by  2  kg for some reason,Providing_information
Good,Providing_information
Cool,Providing_information
I think a flywheelthickness value of  10  is best,Providing_information
im trying to broadcast with bearingoffset equals to  130 ,Providing_information
Anyway you can reduce mass slightly,Providing_information
we desperately need to reduce weight,Providing_information
Flywheel would be the heaviest part,Providing_information
check out my latest broadcast  that looks like the best I can do,Providing_information
we desperately need to reduce weight,Providing_information
we desperately need to reduce weight,Providing_information
we desperately need to reduce weight,Providing_information
No I do not  I would consult the piston,Providing_information
any way i can help in reducing hat weight,Providing_information
flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out,Providing_information
Sorry  I think my mass is  1   5 ,Providing_information
I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
fair  that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase factorofsafety  I ll decrease mass,Providing_information
you can maximize the crank shaft bearing support offset if it benefits your design  it decreases my factorofsafety but my factorofsafety is so high that it doesnt matter much,Providing_information
I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on factorofsafety,Providing_information
So we are in good range right now,Providing_information
So we are in good range right now,Providing_information
I mass just doing what he tells me tbh,Providing_information
haha,Providing_information
if I increase the offset  mass increases,Providing_information
yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight,Providing_information
Yo,Providing_information
Crap  I wish it would update automaticly,Providing_information
meant decrease thickness and lower the weight,Providing_information
yo,Providing_information
yeah increasing pistonborediameter changes mass by an enormous amount  like change of five adds  5  to ms,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
new bearingoffset is broadcast,Providing_information
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Providing_information
I think so,Providing_information
my part minimized the mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   will keep updating it,Providing_information
Preston,Providing_information
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Providing_information
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Providing_information
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Providing_information
hot dog,Providing_information
Hey if I increase pistonborediameter  will that help or hurt your design,Providing_information
that s big,Providing_information
we re at good pull your weight,Providing_information
factorofsafety just went down,Providing_information
alriight,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
aight,Providing_information
about  12 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety just went down,Providing_information
havent found a combination better than   06  and  2   62 ,Providing_information
it is the lowest diameter i could do,Providing_information
ok so id say you worry more about low mass with pistonborediameter and I can worry more about high factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter,Providing_information
no keep it low,Providing_information
it drops the factorofsafety,Providing_information
and im kamran,Providing_information
my part maintains factorofsafety equals to  2   06 ,Providing_information
If you can lower factorofsafety to closer to  2  we might be in business  I think we need to get below the mass limit,Providing_information
minimize it if you can while keeping factorofsafety as close to  2  as possible,Providing_information
Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass,Providing_information
thats great  im at  0   1   2   62 ,Providing_information
maybe lower if needed,Providing_information
Um hold on ,Providing_information
we can make some spare weight elsewhere,Providing_information
i can decrase on the weight but the factorofsafety wouldn t meet requirement,Providing_information
We need factorofsafety to be around  1   5 ,Providing_information
I didnt change anything,Providing_information
I think the factorofsafety shown is the lowest factorofsafety of ours,Providing_information
Well I think each individual part needs a factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Providing_information
But I can try that,Providing_information
bearingoffset was changed to  80 ,Providing_information
seems to be maximized at  2   62  ill keep trying other values,Providing_information
I control pistonborediameter somewhere in  90 ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
yea,Providing_information
But i dont control that,Providing_information
your part seems to be using the most mass so I pistonborediameter say worry about that rather than factorofsafety and see if the others can bump it up,Providing_information
so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit,Providing_information
or just go get food cz i am hungry,Providing_information
alright,Providing_information
Mine has an factorofsafety of  2   42 ,Providing_information
idk my factorofsafety at  2  and weight minimized,Providing_information
Oh I ve got a different system factorofsafety  mine is about  2 ,Providing_information
Piston bore diameter,Providing_information
make sure to reduce weight and keep factorofsafety at  2 ,Providing_information
I mass happy with my numbers  but if you need to change something I will compensate,Providing_information
 0   52 ,Providing_information
im just trying to max factorofsafety but your piston wont affect my flywheel,Providing_information
also piston guy is using pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Providing_information
minimized,Providing_information
  06  and  2   63 ,Providing_information
mass is  1   7  and factorofsafety is  3   5 ,Providing_information
Oh ok mine just updated,Providing_information
we are so close,Providing_information
Is  40  the best value you have found for pistonborediameter,Providing_information
we are soooo close,Providing_information
i dont know where to reduce the weight tho,Providing_information
flywheelthickness is  10 ,Providing_information
flywheeldiameter is  20 ,Providing_information
okay I ll keep lowering it,Providing_information
We got very good,Providing_information
K  lowest I can make my weight with factorofsafety greater than  2  is  5   42  which is a big improvement,Providing_information
ratio for piston pin length to piston diameter,Providing_information
my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott,Providing_information
hommie we need to decrease weight not increase factorofsafety  ,Providing_information
dont move,Providing_information
bottom,Providing_information
Yeah  the mass is huge otherwise,Providing_information
dont move,Providing_information
i can t go lower than this,Providing_information
dont move,Providing_information
dont move,Providing_information
thats right,Providing_information
Yeah still at  40  just made thickness smaller,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
perfect,Providing_information
ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter,Providing_information
Not moving even a bit  :  ,Providing_information
seems to be helping,Providing_information
yeap,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
I think a lower pistonborediameter is better  something like a  75  was giving us a good weight,Providing_information
actually sorry i cant go below  150 ,Providing_information
 2   08 ,Providing_information
Sick  our engine is now excellent,Providing_information
flywheel boi is tryna improve,Providing_information
 2   08 ,Providing_information
if you lower pistonborediameter I can raise the factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter,Providing_information
Ah I see,Providing_information
Yep,Providing_information
lets just try getting our mass down,Providing_information
Yeah it is in good range,Providing_information
lets just try getting our mass down,Providing_information
lets just try getting our mass down,Providing_information
lets just try getting our mass down,Providing_information
 2   42 ,Providing_information
flywheelthickness of  10  is the best for mass,Providing_information
My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
I ll try,Providing_information
My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value,Providing_information
I think the previous dimensions had us at a  very good ,Providing_information
My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value,Providing_information
My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value,Providing_information
or maybe  80 ,Providing_information
on my screen it says quality is excellent,Providing_information
i willl try decreasing dc,Providing_information
i didnt change,Providing_information
Each part should be at  2 ,Providing_information
Gotcha  This is harder than if we had a group chat  ,Providing_information
Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen,Providing_information
no boy we need both,Providing_information
yeah but that increase weight by   5  gram is that worth it for you,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
go back to  88 mm diameter i want to see what happens,Providing_information
I mass at fair quality  factorofsafety is a bit low  total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though,Providing_information
if you get it lower than  2   0   you can try adding some mass  it s ok ,Providing_information
factorofsafety is  1   92  and mass is  1   46 ,Providing_information
the other parts weigh  0   1   0   06   0   52  and  0   99 ,Providing_information
whats the max diamter,Providing_information
Now Im at good  weights a bit high but factorofsafety is right on,Providing_information
you can go,Providing_information
oof,Providing_information
 105 ,Providing_information
mass is lowest it can be with factorofsafety larger than  2   I ll try more decimals,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
currently my mass is  0   53 ,Providing_information
I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down,Providing_information
currently at  90 ,Providing_information
I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down,Providing_information
now its  1   18 ,Providing_information
My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone,Providing_information
but pistonborediameter has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve factorofsafety,Providing_information
for mass,Providing_information
ah  so when we broadcast we can overwrite,Providing_information
As pistonborediameter gets lower  my ms gets way to high,Providing_information
and keep pistonborediameter lower,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
not my pistonborediameter the piston s pistonborediameter,Providing_information
My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone Send,Providing_information
it s at very good for me,Providing_information
pistonborediameter and thickness t,Providing_information
one sec,Providing_information
piston thickness   2 - 7  mm,Providing_information
mass is  0   52   factorofsafety is  2   01   and one of my values is minimized  not sure how much more I can optimize currently,Providing_information
thats with both at their minimum so it can t get any lower for my part,Providing_information
Weigght ,Providing_information
That s what I mass altering,Providing_information
now mass is  1   18 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to  75 ,Providing_information
increasing bearingoffset increases mass,Providing_information
mine says Very Good,Providing_information
i havent broadccasted anything new,Providing_information
If I do the lowest mass I can then factorofsafety goes down by a lot,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
mass is  1   18  and thats with both as low as they can get,Providing_information
we did hit both requirements at one point,Providing_information
right now at  88  shows very good,Providing_information
alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 ,Providing_information
I dont have control over it  I think its you and the piston  Seems to me like the low  80  range was working best though but Im not sure,Providing_information
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Providing_information
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Providing_information
perfect,Providing_information
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Providing_information
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
Literally  there is not,Providing_information
Ok I think right now we just need to decrease mass,Providing_information
alright  just get factorofsafety to right above  2  and that ll have to do,Providing_information
 2   04   no bene,Providing_information
I get higher weight if pistonborediameter decreases,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
flywheelthickness of  10  and flywheeldiameter of  15  is the lowest mass I can get,Providing_information
alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 ,Providing_information
Sure,Providing_information
ah okk,Providing_information
oh,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
cZ i was gonna try  80 ,Providing_information
 1   92 ,Providing_information
lowest mass is best i think flywheel is the heavist thing,Providing_information
i can still reduce the weight somewhat,Providing_information
its  1   92 ,Providing_information
I just got my factorofsafety up to  9 ,Providing_information
ms was  2   79 ,Providing_information
mass at  1   63   factorofsafety at  53   27 ,Providing_information
But my mass is like  0   9 ,Providing_information
Okay  lowest ms i can get is like  5   42 ,Providing_information
keeping factorofsafety at  2 ,Providing_information
yeah i optimized mine as much as ic an,Providing_information
no i dont have control of it,Providing_information
I just bumped mine up,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
just above  2 ,Providing_information
yeah i have no idea how it got changed lol,Providing_information
But that also bumped up my mass like  0   3 ,Providing_information
yeah agreed  it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect  so im going to stick to maximizing factorofsafety,Providing_information
also reducing bearingoffset significantly reduces the factorofsafety,Providing_information
Hi Kamran,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
I think the other designers have way too high factorofsafety s,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
I have control over pistonborediameter,Providing_information
increasing pistonborediameter gives me a worse weight,Providing_information
I have conrod thickness and the ratio between conrod length and crank length,Providing_information
i waaaaaant mooooney,Providing_information
noooooooooooo,Providing_information
NOOOOOO,Providing_information
  2  missed,Providing_information
I think the global factorofsafety is just the minimum value out of the  5  of us,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
we have time,Providing_information
i have control over neither  only bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
i think he does the bore design,Providing_information
im at  0   22  and  2   02 ,Providing_information
mass as low as possible,Providing_information
Keep me updated on your piston bore diameter  It s something I ll need in my simulations,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   90  for now,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
use  15  for now as I try to find better values on my end,Providing_information
sorry  60 ,Providing_information
 55 mm,Providing_information
In the current broadcast  the value is  15 ,Providing_information
I don t think it is,Providing_information
No  not that I know of,Providing_information
thanks ,Providing_information
mass  equals to   1   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   8  for that value,Providing_information
Right now I mass using pistonborediameter  equals to   85 ,Providing_information
I will be changing the thickness and broadcast the value  It should affect the bearing support offset ,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
I mass going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it,Providing_information
I ll check in with you on that in a sec,Providing_information
If that s the same as the thickness of the connecting rod  then I mass currently at  2  mm,Providing_information
That s subject to change though,Providing_information
I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length  All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety,Providing_information
I have to account for the piston diameter  higher values for that mean that I get a higher mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
Right now I have pistonborediameter equals to  85 ,Providing_information
I don t select any diameter,Providing_information
thickness  equals to   10 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   15 ,Providing_information
my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter,Providing_information
something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  ,Providing_information
something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  ,Providing_information
something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  ,Providing_information
try bearing offset  equals to   180   crankshaft pin is  35  mm,Providing_information
Between  45  and  50  would be wonderful ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
Thanks ,Providing_information
That comes from the piston,Providing_information
Right now its at  90 ,Providing_information
sounds good  ill do  45 ,Providing_information
sounds good ill do  45 ,Providing_information
It looks to me like a smaller bearing offset gives both lower mass and higher factor of safety  so I mass thinking about keeping it smaller,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
Gotcha  We ve got to get our factorofsafety up to  1   5  if we re gonna get out of the poor category,Providing_information
higher pistonborediameter is better factorofsafety  and worse  higher  mass,Providing_information
That s odd  I don t have either of those variables,Providing_information
so you don t have flywheel shaft,Providing_information
a higher pistonborediameter increases the mass and factorofsafety  With  85   my mass is  13   09  and factorofsafety is  7   69 ,Providing_information
diameter and flywheel thickness,Providing_information
I reduced the diameter to  40 mm to reduce the mass of the system,Providing_information
hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod  my variables are l 1   length of the pin  and the inner and outer diameter of the pin  di  pistonborediameter 0  ,Providing_information
and ,Providing_information
Right now factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
flywheel would ,Providing_information
okay  I ll try using that now,Providing_information
mass  equals to   6   72 ,Providing_information
 85  right now,Providing_information
Maybe not,Providing_information
Okay  I ll play around with it,Providing_information
I ve increased thickness to  5  mm,Providing_information
I think my pin is what connects the crankshaft connecting rod to the piston,Providing_information
The smaller offset works well for smaller flywheel dimensions but the factorofsafety is higher overall with larger dimensions,Providing_information
Smaller is good  I like  45 ,Providing_information
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Providing_information
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Providing_information
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Providing_information
 40  mm,Providing_information
 40  would work as well if that helps,Providing_information
larger has a better factorofsafety but the currently I used  45  and it s just high enough,Providing_information
actually keep  45  for crankshaft,Providing_information
I ll try it,Providing_information
right now i have a thickness of  12  and diameter of  60 ,Providing_information
smaller gives me a much better factorofsafety,Providing_information
okay  I think the value is not this ,Providing_information
nvm,Providing_information
i got it from crankshaft,Providing_information
Ok ,Providing_information
 1   35   I wonder who has  0   61 ,Providing_information
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Providing_information
smaller is better for me as well,Providing_information
bc thats the lowest and system level factorofsafety,Providing_information
Keeping it  45  ,Providing_information
 40  mm,Providing_information
let shoot for smaller then,Providing_information
 60 mm,Providing_information
I mass using a crank pin diameter of  15  at the moment  in case you needed that value,Providing_information
we can see how good his her part is with  45  and increase if necessary,Providing_information
 2 ,Providing_information
and thickness,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
No i don t think so,Providing_information
fair,Providing_information
piston has  2   01 ,Providing_information
 12  for thickness,Providing_information
 2  is the max factorofsafety that we neeed,Providing_information
Mine is  3   96 ,Providing_information
its up to  1   7  now so getting there,Providing_information
 45  is what I mass currently using  it s acceptable rn,Providing_information
 2   16 ,Providing_information
lower increases my mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
 150  mm,Providing_information
use thickness  10  and diameter  25  for now,Providing_information
kool,Providing_information
Looks like moving from  90  up to  105  doesn t benefit me much in terms of the factorofsafety mass ratio,Providing_information
nope my factorofsafety is  5625 ,Providing_information
So we can keep it low,Providing_information
 75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters,Providing_information
so it looks like our mass is killing us now,Providing_information
The length of the crankshaft,Providing_information
 5625 ,Providing_information
 75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters,Providing_information
Oh I see  yea I ll work on that now,Providing_information
length of pin  diameter of piston  higher is better ,Providing_information
mostly in flywheel design  I mass updating my values to see how those work,Providing_information
piston mass is currently  0   83 ,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
great  thanks ,Providing_information
Currently I mass at  7   69 ,Providing_information
dang,Providing_information
 5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters,Providing_information
im at  0   06 ,Providing_information
 1   62  currently,Providing_information
I mass using  85  so my mass now is  6   72 ,Providing_information
okay thats nothing,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
I don t think so,Providing_information
piston mass is currently  0   83 ,Providing_information
piston mass is currently  0   83 ,Providing_information
is piston bore diameter  90 ,Providing_information
 2 ,Providing_information
I mass going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass  we re not doing too bad with factorofsafety,Providing_information
I mass going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass  we re not doing too bad with factorofsafety,Providing_information
I can  my lowest mass with the  45  bore diameter is  0   11   factorofsafety for that is  2   95 ,Providing_information
 0   55 ,Providing_information
because my part weighs so little  ill just focus on the factorofsafety,Providing_information
okay that seems good,Providing_information
 0   55 ,Providing_information
Right  so I just used  75  and I my factorofsafety is still about  2 ,Providing_information
its  3   24 ,Providing_information
Hello  I do not,Providing_information
most of mass is in piston and flywheel,Providing_information
These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different pistonborediameter :   75  :   5   45    85  :   6   72    95  :   8   08    105  :   9   56   These are the masses for a factorofsafety of  2  for different diameters,Providing_information
I don t have control over that  I believe that s the piston ,Providing_information
I am trying to change the piston thickness to reduce mass too,Providing_information
yeah sounds good,Providing_information
broadcasting,Providing_information
crankshaft weighs the most i think,Providing_information
 1   93  right now,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
oh wait  it might be the connecting rod,Providing_information
okay thats the most mass by far,Providing_information
 0   11 ,Providing_information
 60 ,Providing_information
Noted,Providing_information
connecting rod said their mass is  0   11 ,Providing_information
Ok that doesn t affect mine,Providing_information
Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 ,Providing_information

crankshaft is  1   93 ,Providing_information
piston is  0   83 ,Providing_information
awesome  thanks,Providing_information
maybe just the mass  the broadcast has a very large mass,Providing_information
I ll try to bring it down,Providing_information
They didn t give me that one  I just have crankshaft bearing offset  crankshaft-pin diameter to change,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
Try to lower it to  2 ,Providing_information
my mass is  0   52 ,Providing_information
my objective is to maximize it,Providing_information
Sounds good,Providing_information
There is no benefit for a factorofsafety over  2 ,Providing_information
okay  my mass doesn t change that much so i can change to  20 ,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Providing_information
Try for a factorofsafety of  2  with minimum mass,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Providing_information
great,Providing_information
bearingoffset does not affect the mass  However  as you increase bearingoffset the factor of safety decreases,Providing_information
mine is currently  2   16  so I ll cut that a little closer,Providing_information
Not from what I understand,Providing_information
is diameter  90 ,Providing_information
Mine s still  2   95 ,Providing_information
okay nice,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
mine is  1   48 ,Providing_information
okay we might need to increase your,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 ,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
we only need it to be above  2 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety coz that s minimum,Providing_information
Oh  wow  My factorofsafety is in the  20 s  so I can definitely scale back,Providing_information
Piston Diameter  equals to   90   Height  equals to   6   85   greater than  greater than  greater than  greater than  Mass  equals to   7   44   factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 ,Providing_information

Smaller diameter is better for me,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
My current factorofsafety is also  1   35 ,Providing_information
im using a  40 ,Providing_information
Try and decrease bearingoffset so that we increase the factor of safety,Providing_information
No  I mass at  3   23   Trying to drop that a bit and lower my mass  I mass at  2   11  for mass ,Providing_information
btw our mass is still big  the piston pin only contribute roughly only  0   1  kg of mass,Providing_information
 2   95  is my minimum  I can t go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter,Providing_information
the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team,Providing_information
yeah working on it now,Providing_information
Currently  2   95 ,Providing_information
Get that up  That s the reason our overall is  1 ,Providing_information
cant decrease it anymore  its at  40 ,Providing_information
oh true,Providing_information
I ll be on it,Providing_information
I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me,Providing_information
I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me,Providing_information

I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a factorofsafety of  2   01   Do let me know if you need anything from me,Providing_information
its already over  2 ,Providing_information
Oh I did not receive that update  I ll try my numbers at  40 ,Providing_information
k,Providing_information
Nope  mass  equals to   1   27   factorofsafety _ s equals to  13238 ,Providing_information
with the absolute minimum dimensions my mass is  1   12  and factorofsafety is  4706   97 ,Providing_information
we are on good rn,Providing_information
sure  I mass trying to play with bearingoffset to get a higher factorofsafety,Providing_information
Re-running with new numbers  give me one second,Providing_information
we need mass to be less than  3 ,Providing_information
Oh wait we just need to minimize the mass,Providing_information
in the table with the simulations is what we get from our own parts,Providing_information
Okay,Providing_information
with my current dimensions mass is  1   2  and factorofsafety is  15886   04 ,Providing_information
mass  equals to   1   27   factorofsafety _ s equals to  13238 ,Providing_information
Our factor of safety is greater than  2   which is excellent,Providing_information
I pistonborediameter minimzie mass,Providing_information
ill try,Providing_information
so i dont think that i can change that much,Providing_information
Currently  3   2 ,Providing_information
 21   6     97   still working,Providing_information
Your factorofsafety is huge,Providing_information
aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize the mass and have a shot at the  very good,Providing_information
excellent is above  2  but with mass lower than  2 ,Providing_information
Yes  with that my factorofsafety is now  2   17 ,Providing_information
Diameter and thickness,Providing_information
so even with  2   01  factorofsafety we can get excellent,Providing_information
Just did,Providing_information
its  2700 ,Providing_information
I mass at  2   77  now  all my numbers are at their minimum,Providing_information
Yeah  I mass trying to figure that out  it seems really large,Providing_information
okay nice,Providing_information
THis is tru  communicate with crankshaft  He s our weakest link factorofsafety wise at the moment,Providing_information
REFRESH IT  ITS LOWER THAN  2  RIGHT NOW,Providing_information
Yes  that s the minimum diameter I can use,Providing_information
sorry left my caps on,Providing_information
flywheel thickness and diameter,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
I mass now at  2   77   all my numbers are at their minimum,Providing_information
Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness  piston bore diameter,Providing_information
great  thanks ,Providing_information
Only the loest matters  so there s no need for anything above  2 ,Providing_information
hahaha,Providing_information
Mass is now  0   1 ,Providing_information
Mass is now  0   1 ,Providing_information
I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length,Providing_information
 1   2 ,Providing_information
 3   2   but that s about to decrease since my mass is way too high,Providing_information
hmm i reverted to previous dimensions,Providing_information
 2880 ,Providing_information
 6   72 ,Providing_information
we need factorofsafety up a bit more now overall,Providing_information
Ok  I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Providing_information
Yeah  factorofsafety hasn t been an issue for me  it s just mass is way too high,Providing_information
Ok  seems like  85  is good for pistonborediameter then,Providing_information
That s alright  as long as we have a factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Providing_information
Only the lowest matters  so there s no need for anything above  2 ,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
not sure whose is  1   79 ,Providing_information
i have  1   7  factorofsafety with  58  mass,Providing_information
 2   77 ,Providing_information
It s just updated  now mass is  3   11  and factorofsafety is  2   07 ,Providing_information
Right  Got mine to mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Providing_information
awesome,Providing_information
and yes I mass broadcasting that,Providing_information
its piston pin designer,Providing_information
Aim for factorofsafety to be above  2  while minimizing mass,Providing_information
t  equals to   10 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   18 ,Providing_information
 1   7  with bearing offset of  300 ,Providing_information
for pistonborediameter  equals to   75   mass  equals to   3   11 ,Providing_information
Good point  I could reduce my mass by   15  and the part will still be plenty strong,Providing_information
and one sec for the other one,Providing_information
i can decrease diameter,Providing_information
i talked to the TA and the factorofsafety of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing  In other words  that number doesn t relate to a single person t part apparently,Providing_information
okay ,Providing_information
 person s,Providing_information
not yet  might change to thickness  12  diameter  40  because my factorofsafety is huge,Providing_information
minimum is  15  and i am at  20 ,Providing_information
We have some wiggle room in our mass now  I can try adjusting my thicknesses and see if that helps,Providing_information
yes  an old version  I mass running the simulations you requested noe,Providing_information
mass is currently  1   53  and factorofsafety  2   01 ,Providing_information
try and use  60  for bearingoffset,Providing_information
We ve got a Good factorofsafety now  just need to get mass down,Providing_information
 1   48   my mass is so small im just trying to increase my factorofsafety,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
We ve got far too much mass at the moment overall,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
I had factorofsafety  1   35  and mass equals to  0   93  in that run,Providing_information
I did  earlier,Providing_information
for pistonborediameter  equals to   85   min mass is  3   4 ,Providing_information
for me to have high factorofsafety i have to have high numbers,Providing_information
 1   12 ,Providing_information
I ll try again with new parameters,Providing_information
oh okay,Providing_information
might need to change something else,Providing_information
mass  equals to   4   factorofsafety  equals to   2   4 ,Providing_information
difference of about  0   1 ,Providing_information
You re pretty solid,Providing_information
if we can do that it cuts my mass to  1   24 ,Providing_information
so really not much,Providing_information
a mass of  58  for one component automatically puts us in the poor mark,Providing_information
K  I mass at  4 ,Providing_information
 58 ,Providing_information
Check the top of the second page of the handout,Providing_information
we need to cut down on mass,Providing_information
Yeah  I mass leaving mine as is for now  Trying to figure out why our total mass is so high ,Providing_information
I think it s all coming from crankshaft  He doesnt seem to know whats going on,Providing_information
I think it s all coming from crankshaft  He doesnt seem to know whats going on,Providing_information
under performance requirements,Providing_information
Yup ,Providing_information
 7   4 ,Providing_information
mass  1   24 ,Providing_information
For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  my minimum factorofsafety is  2   85 ,Providing_information
its huge its  15886 ,Providing_information
We re good,Providing_information
We re good ,Providing_information
 2   01  still,Providing_information
We ve gotta get crankshaft down  He s like all of our mass atm,Providing_information
We re good,Providing_information
no clue,Providing_information
Ok  and your mass is pretty small  so it isn t a big deal  Mine is currently  27   44   so I mass trying to reduce it,Providing_information
we are in excellent rn,Providing_information
We re good,Providing_information
okay sweet,Providing_information
yes   75  works for me and piston,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
The mass increased a lot,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
We re done,Providing_information
We re done,Providing_information
we are tryin to cut down on mass right now,Providing_information
We re done,Providing_information
now its  1   67 ,Providing_information
yeet,Providing_information
We re done,Providing_information
We only need above  2   so try as must as you can to lower the mass,Providing_information
i did it,Providing_information
I adjusted my numbers  mass is now  0   16  factorofsafety is  4   66 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   2   mass  equals to   6   72 ,Providing_information
right now we need to focus on mass,Providing_information
Ok looks like we re good,Providing_information
actually,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
both  becaus factorofsafety is pretty low too,Providing_information
Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT,Providing_information
I am done,Providing_information
Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT,Providing_information
Don t change anything,Providing_information
Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT,Providing_information
it does increase my factorofsafety,Providing_information
Great,Providing_information
Yep  values finalized,Providing_information
piston-pin s factorofsafety is lowest i beliver,Providing_information
that s at my minimum dimensions  I can t,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
bearing is  150   pin is  50  mm,Providing_information
Sweet ,Providing_information
bearingoffset and dc,Providing_information
my mass is  1   27  already,Providing_information
Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good,Providing_information
Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good,Providing_information
Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good,Providing_information
Someone just screwed it up  Now we re in very good,Providing_information
it says very good,Providing_information
mine is  29 ,Providing_information
i am using  60  rn,Providing_information
I mass trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass,Providing_information
Yea  nvm we re good i think,Providing_information
i think i changed it to excellent,Providing_information
No,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
 1215 ,Providing_information
but im strugling with mass,Providing_information
same as crankshaft,Providing_information
Yeah  I saw that  Wondering if it s the crankshaft,Providing_information
its  1   52  with that,Providing_information
i changed to excellent,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
we are good on mass  Now we need to work on safety factor,Providing_information
I haven t it increases mass and decreases factorofsafety so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn t make sense on my end,Providing_information
We re a little above the mass but otherwise good,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
I can give a factorofsafety equals to  6  with mass  equals to   0   4 ,Providing_information
Our mass is too high again,Providing_information
 1   67 ,Providing_information
i changed the mass from  50  to  30 ,Providing_information
 1   67 ,Providing_information
Yes  that works,Providing_information
pretty sure its someone else,Providing_information
yeah,Providing_information
I don t actually,Providing_information
I changed something but it didn t affect my mass at all,Providing_information
 1   67 ,Providing_information
maybe  I ll try to go back,Providing_information
Nope things changed to the worst now,Providing_information
hmm okay,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step,Providing_information
I broadcasted that,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step,Providing_information
my factorofsafety is the minimum at  2   10  so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that factorofsafety is the last step,Providing_information
at a bore diameter of  45  i don t think there s anything I can do  I mass going to play around with bore diameter to see if that helps,Providing_information
we still need to reduce mass by a lot,Providing_information
No mines the same,Providing_information
and increase factorofsafety a decent amount,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   85   mass  equals to   6   72 ,Providing_information
thickness  12  diameter  60 ,Providing_information
t  equals to   5   7   r 1   equals to   4 ,Providing_information
Mine is at  2   05 ,Providing_information
and pistonborediameter  equals to   85 ,Providing_information
try bore diamter of  40 ,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
Yeah  my factorofsafety is minimized as well,Providing_information
and i have an offset of  150  so if that changed let me know,Providing_information
okay  I mass going to try and change bearingoffset,Providing_information
piston-pin has the lowest I believe   1   67 ,Providing_information
We need just a hair less mass,Providing_information
 2   77 ,Providing_information
I control the diameter of the piston head and the thickness of the piston head,Providing_information
will do,Providing_information
Changing pistonborediameter from  40  to  70  lowers the factorofsafety drastically like    3   0  but lowers the mass just a bit like    0   1 kg,Providing_information
We need just a hair less mass,Providing_information
Yeah that s what I ve found too,Providing_information
 4706   67   I ve reduced my mass as far as possible,Providing_information
I mass at  2   77 ,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  45 ,Providing_information
KK,Providing_information
pistonborediameter  equals to   75   r 2  equals to  0   89   r 3  equals to  0   8 ,Providing_information
We need just a hair less mass,Providing_information
so i got an factorofsafety of  3   39  and mass of  0   11 ,Providing_information
I broadcasted something but then i changed it now,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Providing_information
The greater the values for either of those  the greater the factorofsafety and mass,Providing_information
So I think for  40  mm is good for now,Providing_information
at bore diameter of  40 ,Providing_information
 2   01 ,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
Mine s  2   03   Don t think I can get that lower,Providing_information
okay thats better,Providing_information
No,Providing_information
broadcasting  2   85  with a mass of  1   36 ,Providing_information
Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   44 ,Providing_information
yes i changed my numbers,Providing_information
pistonborediameter equals to  75   mass  equals to   1   36   factorofsafety  equals to   2   85 ,Providing_information
 2   77  is my minimum mass and factorofsafety I mass afraid,Providing_information
no mine is  2   0 ,Providing_information
i dropped  1  kg with  3  factorofsafety,Providing_information
Get your factorofsafety just above  2  with as little mass as possible,Providing_information
I mass at  1   01  for mass if factorofsafety  equals to   2   03   I don t think that can get better unless a shared dimension changes,Providing_information
 0   52 ,Providing_information
I need to change pistonborediameter to  85  though,Providing_information
yeah I saw that  I haven t changed anything,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
My piston mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Providing_information
it was  2   79  then made a couple changes and now it  1   25 ,Providing_information
I didn t change anything  still at bearingoffset equals to  150  and dc equals to  45 ,Providing_information
Must be crankshaft,Providing_information
 85  right now  I was trying to optimize mass,Providing_information
bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  45 ,Providing_information
mine is  1215 ,Providing_information
 2 ,Providing_information
I think the rest of us are right around  2   0 ,Providing_information
Okay good  I mass at  85  too,Providing_information
mass  27   44 ,Providing_information
we need it to be higher than  2 ,Providing_information
factorofsafety  2   06 ,Providing_information
The piston bore diameter could be larger and my weight would still be ok  I mass at  0   1 ,Providing_information
mass  1   24    factorofsafety  2   01   but if bore diameter was reduced to  40  it could be mass equals to   1   15  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   79 ,Providing_information
my best was  1   67  at a bore diameter of  45 ,Providing_information
Change it back to a run with a factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
 10  bucks aint bad,Providing_information
nothing much i could change at  45 ,Providing_information
wont let me,Providing_information
it s not me im good,Providing_information

ok,Providing_information
I control piston diameter and piston head thickness,Providing_information
hey  im seeing the Crankshaft bearing support offset to be  60   0 mm  is this what you got,Providing_information
Ok I also broadcast my best  it gives good weight and fs,Providing_information
piston diameter is  75   thickness is  10   5 ,Providing_information
ok  increasing the diameter will decrease my mass and my factory of safety,Providing_information
Increasing bearingoffset only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start  Do you need it bigger greater than ,Providing_information
and the Flywheel shaft diameter to be  15 ,Providing_information
Yes that is what I have input,Providing_information

decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety,Providing_information
increase  sorry,Providing_information
Currently I have the lowest piston diameter selected  but in general yes lower diameter means lower mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
yea,Providing_information
bearingoffset,Providing_information
ok yeye,Providing_information
I don t understand,Providing_information
we could try to go lower  Im still trying to figure out how this works haha,Providing_information
so raising bearingoffset increases mass and reduces factorofsafety,Providing_information
no idea,Providing_information
if you increase the diameter  the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease,Providing_information
Yeah thats what I got,Providing_information
decrease mass,Providing_information
decrease mass,Providing_information
decrease mass,Providing_information
I get better factorofsafety but worse mass when i maximize bearingoffset  so it problably needs to be in the middle,Providing_information
decrease mass,Providing_information
I also have a second parameter that increases factorofsafety and mass if I increase that,Providing_information
i think so  I think i just figured out what i need to do  I was confused at first,Providing_information
Ok  Our factorofsafety isn t too bad right now so that s probably a good place to be at the moment,Providing_information
same  60  is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now,Providing_information
i dont think so,Providing_information
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Providing_information
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Providing_information
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Providing_information
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Providing_information
ahh gotcha,Providing_information
it just became  0   13  though,Providing_information
So we need to get min mass and max factorofsafety flywheelbut we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think,Providing_information
yea and increase factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
I am a little confused  I though I knew what I was doing  but when I hit broadcast my numbers for the subsystem changed ,Providing_information
oh yeah but this communication system is a struggle,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
that s cool,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
My best values on both charts have bearingoffset equals to  60  in common,Providing_information
yo uright,Providing_information
Yeah I just saw that  and our weight is massive,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
 I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety ,Providing_information
retweet,Providing_information
 I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety ,Providing_information
 I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety ,Providing_information
The flywheel shaft diameter was just changed to  17   5 ,Providing_information
yes and I am also playing with my numbers because I just realized now what to do  I am still getting poor quality though,Providing_information
 I have bearingoffset and dc  bearingoffset increases mass decreases factorofsafety   dc increases mass and factorofsafety ,Providing_information
Yes,Providing_information
yes  one minute on that,Providing_information
Made diameter  75 ,Providing_information
mine is mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84 ,Providing_information
Yeah I mass not exactly sure either  We need to get the total factorofsafety over  2   and total mass under  3   Not quite sure on how all the parts interact,Providing_information
so for flywheel reasonable mass and best factorofsafety is giving thickness of  12 ,Providing_information
I currently have the lightest mass and it is still too much ,Providing_information
That s the minimum,Providing_information
Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks,Providing_information
I don t know how to find that info,Providing_information
Hi  If you have an initial parameter set ready  please go ahead and broadcast the same  I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for factorofsafety  Thanks,Providing_information

oh okay ,Providing_information
Okay,Providing_information
Im at  2 nd lowest mass,Providing_information
dec mass,Providing_information
yup,Providing_information
nevermind just updated broadcast,Providing_information
with what I have now my mass is the lowest it can be,Providing_information
Just did max   105  ,Providing_information
Flywheel is thinking we need to reduce mass,Providing_information
I think this is a trap,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
my configuration has one of the lowest masses available atm,Providing_information
they don t wanna give us  20  bucks,Providing_information
mine is currently mass equals to  0   02  and factorofsafety equals to  0   22  but my max factorofsafety is  0   24 ,Providing_information
I can reduce the mass of the piston  but  it s going to cost a bit on factorofsafety  Drops factorofsafety by  1  ish,Providing_information
Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important,Providing_information
i think this is a trap,Providing_information

I can choose diameter between  75  and  105 ,Providing_information
my highest mass option is   03  so it might be best for me to just use that and get our highest factorofsafety,Providing_information
wow english,Providing_information

Moving bore diameter down to  55   that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on factorofsafety as much  Rod designer is cool with it,Providing_information
ok for me larger piston bore increases mass and factorofsafety too,Providing_information
no I just asked piston pin guy,Providing_information

thats high my max factorofsafety doesn t even go above  1   23 ,Providing_information
connecting rod thickness  t 1   and connecting rod length ratio  r 1  ,Providing_information
those values give the best factorofsafety value ans  2 nd lowest mass,Providing_information
no i do not  i am compiling everyones,Providing_information
i depend on the piston,Providing_information

i do,Providing_information
mine is  1200 ,Providing_information
my lowest factorofsafety is  1   46   max is  31   19 ,Providing_information
Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by   15  while also increasing factorofsafety by   65 ,Providing_information
I had r 2  equals to   75   and r 3  equals to   68  and that gave an okay factorofsafety  but I just lowered it to r 2  equals to   7  and r 3  equals to   55  which lowered the factorofsafety too much,Providing_information

thanks,Providing_information
i dont know what to do,Providing_information
 150  is working pretty well for me right now,Providing_information
Ok  I will try that now,Providing_information
The lowest offset possible would be ideal for the mass and factorofsafety for the crankshaft,Providing_information
increasing the bore diameter will increase the factor of safety as well as increase weight,Providing_information
bearingoffset  equals to   150 ,Providing_information
I have found a piston bore diameter of around  90  to be best for me,Providing_information
doth pistonborediameter and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass,Providing_information
I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed,Providing_information
try  41   25  for t _ f and  45  for diameter,Providing_information

gotchya thanks,Providing_information
alright awesome,Providing_information
thats the pistonpin i think  rn i have piston diameter of  90 ,Providing_information
Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both,Providing_information

the   20  we just won,Providing_information
good point,Providing_information
OK,Providing_information
but stil mass equals to  3   48 ,Providing_information
ur not wrong,Providing_information
I got  2   36 ,Providing_information
crankshaft a lil suspicious too,Providing_information
 43  or lower for factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Providing_information
I have pistonborediameter at  40 ,Providing_information
ok  ,Providing_information
nah man he chill,Providing_information
im chatting him up lol,Providing_information
for mass equals to  3   48 ,Providing_information
let s just determine the weight first,Providing_information

try and lower that mass,Providing_information
That sounds ideal to me,Providing_information
we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible,Providing_information
im not surprised he has a pretty big head,Providing_information

i am at my lowest,Providing_information
we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible,Providing_information

we need to lower our mass,Providing_information
Around  2  would be ideal,Providing_information
yeah I think since the piston pin weighs so little  what you have is good,Providing_information
im at  2  rn,Providing_information
mine are  1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  ,Providing_information
 suspiciously looks around room ,Providing_information
I think you should try to lower your diameter to  45  or so and see what happens ,Providing_information
 and gets called out for it ,Providing_information
 3   95 ,Providing_information
yet the mass the horrible lol,Providing_information
My sheet says piston bore diameter but it s not a variable that I control ,Providing_information
yeah haha,Providing_information
we were at  3   5  mass and  1   5  factorofsafety but now it is worse,Providing_information
the one guy did not respond to my message,Providing_information
fake,Providing_information
no  20  for him,Providing_information
Easy   20   : pistonborediameter,Providing_information
I tihnk its the same thing,Providing_information
I am having it at  40 ,Providing_information

i got barely any points on the third problem,Providing_information
we can,Providing_information
i might be heavy but i can only do down in mass slightly,Providing_information
i refuse to go back to those lectures so im just gonna wait,Providing_information
I do not,Providing_information
im assuming these are horizontal,Providing_information
yeahh i think thats what happened to most people,Providing_information
yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back,Providing_information

yea it was perfect a minute ago,Providing_information
my value has been the same as well thanks for the update,Providing_information
it still doesnt,Providing_information
oh for sure,Providing_information
ours just does donuts as of rn,Providing_information
i hope they read all this,Providing_information
ok your numbers seem ok idk where this low factorofsafety came from it was just good ,Providing_information
mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft,Providing_information
nor crankshaft,Providing_information
keep factorofsafety around  2  never below,Providing_information

Hello my friend,Providing_information
q 2  :  is is smaller than a refridgerator,Providing_information
yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea,Providing_information
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Providing_information
the final isnt cumulative tho,Providing_information
q 3  :  does it hav emoving parts,Providing_information
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Providing_information
 moving,Providing_information
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Providing_information
so thats nice,Providing_information
indeed,Providing_information
mine is only mass dependent as factorofsafety is very high,Providing_information
acceptable weight now,Providing_information
yeah i think she ll maybe even drop some hints about the exam ,Providing_information
Someone is below  2 ,Providing_information
for some reason i cant go that low,Providing_information
Flywheel prob,Providing_information
and ya no its not which is nice,Providing_information

looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain factorofsafety,Providing_information
I think that will be the crankshaft ,Providing_information
nevermind i am at the minimum thickness setting,Providing_information
I will change to  70 ,Providing_information
truuu,Providing_information
I don t think so,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
Yea  I am working with my numbers to try and fix that ,Providing_information
our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
Im at diameter  equals to   52   5  and thickness  equals to   35 ,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
looks like I picked a whole bouquet of oopsy daisies,Providing_information

literally dead lol - try to increase factorofsafety,Providing_information
ok looks like you have the biggest   of mass in our system,Providing_information
With t  10  pistonborediameter  25  and bearingoffset equals to  70  the output is ms equals to  0   55  and factorofsafety equals to  4821   91 ,Providing_information
okay so my factorofsafety is over  2000  for any design parameters and the mass is less than  2  so I can t figure out how my design affects everyone,Providing_information
we need mass down a bit,Providing_information
My mass is  0   87 ,Providing_information
okie,Providing_information
I currently have it at the lowest   150  am trying to run simulation to see how it affects the output values,Providing_information
Ok  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 ,Providing_information
I mass guessing the crankshaft  the piston is   55  and the piston pin is  0   06 ,Providing_information
right now  I am at  20 ,Providing_information
Bore diameter according to the piston is  40  mm,Providing_information
now im using diameter  equals to   55  thickness  15 ,Providing_information
hmm ok  ,Providing_information
 8   67 ,Providing_information
mass is   13  and factorofsafety is  3   1 ,Providing_information
Yea I believe so ,Providing_information
Looks good  I am at  2   03  and  0   05   equals to  mass,Providing_information
were in good range rn,Providing_information
I also have that dimension,Providing_information
were in good range rn,Providing_information
were in good range rn,Providing_information
were in good range rn,Providing_information
so someone is a little confused,Providing_information
TRUE,Providing_information
okay now we re better lol - idk what happened,Providing_information
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
mines at  3 ,Providing_information
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
Yeah,Providing_information
Yeah  that was weird haha,Providing_information
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Providing_information
and our average is really low,Providing_information
currenty  2   03   but that can be raised ,Providing_information
 61   91 ,Providing_information
i was using the max but am running simulations for a smaller value currently,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
Mine is at  4   55 ,Providing_information
Awesome  thanks ,Providing_information
thanks ,Providing_information
I don t think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from  40  to  70 ,Providing_information
for the last simulation it is  43 ,Providing_information
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values,Providing_information
Ok I was at bearing support offset of  150  and crank-pin diameter of  43   8 ,Providing_information
ooo nice,Providing_information
 1   64 ,Providing_information
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values,Providing_information
Which gives lowest weight,Providing_information
That s good,Providing_information
The input crank-shaft bearing support offset,Providing_information
 1   64 ,Providing_information
 max,Providing_information
okay okay,Providing_information
ok that was what I was seeing as well,Providing_information
perfect,Providing_information
Yup ,Providing_information
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my value,Providing_information
weight is an output for me  The lowest weight I can get with a passable factor of safety at the current bore is  0   53 ,Providing_information
Your old values gave a higher mass with same factorofsafety  but not sure how it affects other stuff,Providing_information
 40 - 70  mm,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
 40 - 70 ,Providing_information
mass  equals to   11   09 ,Providing_information
alright ,Providing_information
ok same,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   8   67 ,Providing_information
Ok I think ive worked out a good combo as far as mass factorofsafety ,Providing_information
I have it set to max currently  so we may need to both be changing that,Providing_information
diameter is  25  mm,Providing_information
yes ,Providing_information
I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier,Providing_information
Sounds great to me,Providing_information
 15  to  25 ,Providing_information
ms :  1   17  fs :  2   0 ,Providing_information
Sounds great to me  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 ,Providing_information
I could  but in reality the goal is  2   0   I could only go upto  3   44   but it would appear that the factorofsafety issue isn t on my end ,Providing_information
Yea I don t think so either ,Providing_information
I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier,Providing_information
Currently have a simulation at bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  50  flywheeldiameter equals to  40  flywheelthickness equals to  51  pistonborediameter equals to  105  with projected output ms equals to  23   24  and factorofsafety equals to  3   96 ,Providing_information
currently  50 ,Providing_information
I would double my system weight though ,Providing_information
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Providing_information
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Providing_information
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Providing_information
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Providing_information
 0   1  and  2   55 ,Providing_information
I am also not trying to change the design form here ,Providing_information
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Providing_information
I can try  that is the limit tho,Providing_information
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Providing_information
thickness is  10  mm,Providing_information
Sounds good  Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then,Providing_information
i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 ,Providing_information
that puts my mass at  2   43  and factorofsafety at  3   9  with t equals to  10   pistonborediameter equals to  25   and bearingoffset equals to  70   That s not bad for now,Providing_information
i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 ,Providing_information
makes sense,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
I haven t changed the broadcast for awhile  it must be someone else,Providing_information
Yeah  I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me ,Providing_information
See if you can lower your mass just a little bit,Providing_information
its  80  rn,Providing_information
piston bore diameter,Providing_information
currently working with them,Providing_information
I got a little better mass results,Providing_information
ok got it,Providing_information
okay perfect,Providing_information
using r 2   equals to   0   7  and r 3   equals to   0   7  at the moment,Providing_information
i think so,Providing_information
Well you ve got the crankshaft  it should be the heaviest,Providing_information
 80 ,Providing_information
hmm that s weird,Providing_information
I ll try,Providing_information
Diameter of  50 ,Providing_information
nope ,Providing_information
Our dimensions line up at least,Providing_information
Ok updated broadcast  now we re close,Providing_information
neato,Providing_information
though I might switch to  75 ,Providing_information
I think we should be good  just don t change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction,Providing_information
I asked the other designers and the factorofsafety seems to be fine,Providing_information
im not sure,Providing_information
okay nice,Providing_information
Ok that s what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes,Providing_information
kk,Providing_information
and our mass so high,Providing_information
however i can bring it all the way down to  40  and still have a factorofsafety of  2   7 ,Providing_information
I can broadcast htat,Providing_information
total,Providing_information
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Providing_information
 0   13 ,Providing_information
I don t control that aspect it affects my value but I don t control it,Providing_information
 2   43  which is a bit high,Providing_information
The factorofsafety range for others is between  2   5  and  4   09 ,Providing_information
Heaviest Ms :   3   64  Highest factorofsafety :   6   92 ,Providing_information
My part only accounts for only  0   1  so I can t do much for mass,Providing_information
r 2  and r 3  of the piston pin,Providing_information
Great - makes sense  that s my job lol,Providing_information
I don t know ,Providing_information
That might not be worth it then,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
sweet,Providing_information
 0   13 ,Providing_information
Great - we re getting close  I mass trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values,Providing_information
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Providing_information
I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Providing_information
piston is in charge of the diameter,Providing_information
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Providing_information
yeah drop that to like  1   5  if you can,Providing_information
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Providing_information
 0   55 ,Providing_information
I Have  Since my part is probably the lightest  I increased my fs,Providing_information
that makes sense,Providing_information
Im at  12   60  now ,Providing_information
trying to lower mass of  2   43   still using  70 ,Providing_information
Yeah me too  just told everyone to calm down a little 3 ,Providing_information
cool thanks,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
mine is  0   1  so idk why our mass is so high,Providing_information
thats a good idea,Providing_information
I think my part and yours are doing fine,Providing_information
Just did  I think that made it heavier,Providing_information
more like first hour,Providing_information
the crankshafts mass is really high,Providing_information
Awesome  thank you,Providing_information
update : ,Providing_information
yeah it s a lot heavier,Providing_information
mass  equals to   9   86 ,Providing_information
Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy then,Providing_information
factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 ,Providing_information
I think my pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier,Providing_information
nope mine has been at  1   27 ,Providing_information
maybe try and adjust again to find a balance,Providing_information
lol definitely  i mass keeping my values the same for now and trying to communicate with everyone,Providing_information
oh okok,Providing_information
Right now we need to reduce mass and keep factorofsafety  do u want to also see if anyone can do that so its not a free for all,Providing_information
 0   87 ,Providing_information
yes but i didnt broadcast,Providing_information
yeah im not sure either  trying to find out,Providing_information
Same haha,Providing_information
Great - thanks,Providing_information
Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Providing_information
Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Providing_information
because it just skyrocketed,Providing_information
Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Providing_information
no only on piston bore diameter,Providing_information
mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above  2 ,Providing_information
Nope  havent changed anything,Providing_information
I think hes at factorofsafety  1   64  and mass of  2   26  but that was a while ago,Providing_information
got it  hmmm,Providing_information
BTW  shaved my mass down a tad  mass  equals to   0   52  now,Providing_information
Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems,Providing_information
I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around,Providing_information
Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems,Providing_information
It might be the flywheel or crankshaft folks,Providing_information
With my current design  mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   0 ,Providing_information
ok change it to  84  and see what happens,Providing_information
yes agreed,Providing_information
I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
I ve kept my numbers steady for a while,Providing_information
I mass trying to do that as well,Providing_information
Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy  Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems,Providing_information
I think we should go with  40 ,Providing_information
for the diameter,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
I think if you minimize the mass  we can work together to get a good factor of safety,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
TRUE,Providing_information
yeah me too,Providing_information
ok will try some other variations,Providing_information
nice  So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight,Providing_information
because if I go with  50   factorofsafety would be too low,Providing_information
Ok we re good I think,Providing_information
Ok we re good I think,Providing_information
woo ,Providing_information
Ok we re good I think,Providing_information
Just changed it and it didn t help much,Providing_information
Not by much  I can find values that work for it quickly,Providing_information
Oh no,Providing_information
okay let s tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn,Providing_information
Ok ,Providing_information
I dunno,Providing_information
Yeah it is either him or the flywheel,Providing_information
no have not plugged in any new values,Providing_information
and yea I am broadcasting,Providing_information
yep i got it,Providing_information
Wasn t me,Providing_information
our factorofsafety is so low,Providing_information
Yea  Our dimensions line up  so there may be miscommunication among other members,Providing_information
Mass yes,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
I am thanks for letting me know ,Providing_information
the flywheel apparently only has a mass of  1   27 ,Providing_information
mass is  3  and factorofsafety is  1   44 ,Providing_information
only  bearingoffset  affects my factorofsafety  Butmy factorofsafety is in the range of thousands so I don t think it matters too much ,Providing_information
I can sacrifice some factorofsafety if it will take off a lot of mass,Providing_information
I will ask others,Providing_information
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Providing_information
Perfect ,Providing_information
I Havent updated in awhile so my numbers are ms :   3   64  factorofsafety :  6   92 ,Providing_information
okay one sec,Providing_information
For the diameter  I think we should use  40 ,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples factorofsafety,Providing_information
Piston diameter,Providing_information
yeah min is  2   77 ,Providing_information
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Providing_information
I dont no,Providing_information
increase your factorofsafety ,Providing_information
bc for me  if it is  50   I can t get my factorofsafety to go high,Providing_information
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Providing_information
mine is at the highest possible value,Providing_information
yea sure,Providing_information
lowering flywheeldiameter helps with mass,Providing_information
pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset,Providing_information
 1   66 ,Providing_information
oh  60  is good,Providing_information
Ok I can do that,Providing_information
Change it back to  105  because the mass will decrease,Providing_information
I ve got  2  of my own variables,Providing_information
bearingoffset and pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset,Providing_information
OK,Providing_information
 mine,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
I mass jumping between   0   7   0   7   and   0   7   0   8   for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass,Providing_information
hmm okay i will talk with others,Providing_information
Just did,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter,Providing_information
ok ,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
now its  4   92 ,Providing_information
crankshaft bearing offset,Providing_information
i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk,Providing_information
Ok  Be sure to update the broadcast so everyone knows where we are ,Providing_information
Let s try  75 ,Providing_information
yeah u should probs freeze,Providing_information
sure,Providing_information
mass  equals to   0   16   factorofsafety  equals to   4   66 ,Providing_information
yeah I,Providing_information
No one is updating broadcast,Providing_information
i shit you not lol ,Providing_information
great thanks,Providing_information
I mass communicating now,Providing_information
Reduces mass let me see what i can do,Providing_information
thats bonkers,Providing_information
No  because I haven t needed to  I mass mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now ,Providing_information
Same   40  is the way to go,Providing_information
yes  with a mass of  0   1 ,Providing_information
the factorofsafety went up from  4821  to  5625 ,Providing_information
I just try  75 ,Providing_information
Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75 ,Providing_information
our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad,Providing_information
Nope  I have held mine constant since i cant get better than mass :   1   61  and factorofsafety :   1   35 ,Providing_information
ok i got factorofsafety  2   02  and mass of  5   82 ,Providing_information
to simulate,Providing_information
and see,Providing_information
 5625 ,Providing_information
Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot ,Providing_information
Alrighty  Just updated it,Providing_information
 70 ,Providing_information
If the piston diameter is  75   I can get a good mix of mass and fs,Providing_information
good stick with that,Providing_information
Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75  to see what happens,Providing_information
 1   35 ,Providing_information
We had a very good one at  80  before,Providing_information
Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75 to see what happens,Providing_information
I have  at least on my screen ,Providing_information
I have it low as possible,Providing_information
 4   55 ,Providing_information
Hello,Providing_information
 4   55 ,Providing_information
 4707 ,Providing_information
yeah that s what I thought,Providing_information
oh noooo go back,Providing_information
No  I have two of my own variables,Providing_information
the one that is currently broadcasted is  6   92   Thats the max i can get,Providing_information
no I dont,Providing_information
I can lower my diameter more if you need it,Providing_information
Hahaha wow,Providing_information
diameter just updated back to  80 ,Providing_information
I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do,Providing_information
OK,Providing_information
great,Providing_information
mass  1   66  factorofsafety  1   64 ,Providing_information
and then my system depends on  3  other variables,Providing_information
 7   98 ,Providing_information
dang that factorofsafety is low,Providing_information
it s so bad lol,Providing_information
 3   64 ,Providing_information
nope,Providing_information
sounds good,Providing_information
 2   11   I can t really descrease is  my dimensions are at their max min,Providing_information
just did,Providing_information
it s  5625  but my part has a weird factorofsafety,Providing_information
Awesome,Providing_information
 51  and  1   1 ,Providing_information
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Providing_information
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Providing_information
My mass is  1   12   factorofsafety is  4707 ,Providing_information
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Providing_information
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Providing_information
I mass using   0   7    0   7   at the moment,Providing_information
Ok I think someone is confused,Providing_information
OK,Providing_information
bearingoffset :  150  dc :  50 ,Providing_information
hmm,Providing_information
and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter,Providing_information
great - please leave it there,Providing_information
 9   86 ,Providing_information
Same here  the total simulation was very good for two seconds and that someone completely messed it up,Providing_information
I updated to the values that gave me mass  equals to   0   52  and fs  equals to   2   0  and have not since,Providing_information
so for me besides diameter  i can play around with two variables,Providing_information
back at  80 ,Providing_information
Diameter is  40  mm,Providing_information
yeah it sucked,Providing_information
one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio,Providing_information
I mean factorofsafety and mass,Providing_information
back at 80 ,Providing_information
just got an factorofsafety of  2   03  and mass of  1   01 ,Providing_information
back at  80 ,Providing_information
Im sticking with that,Providing_information
these are the same values for the  very good  design,Providing_information
and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Providing_information
great ,Providing_information
back at  80 ,Providing_information
ok  I have heard nothing from Crank Design,Providing_information
Yea our dimensions line up then,Providing_information
I change it back to  80  since the overall results for  75  are not good,Providing_information
yeah  working on it,Providing_information
the broadcasted values of  2   31  and  1   4 ,Providing_information
I think so,Providing_information
 51  and  1   1  my values keep getting messed up,Providing_information
yeah idk what,Providing_information
our mass is already  10 kg too high,Providing_information
OK,Providing_information
 17   5  would be great  lowers mass a ton,Providing_information
well the grade scale shows that a total mass below  2  should be possible,Providing_information
yeah we were over  2  about a minute ago,Providing_information
 0   55 ,Providing_information
right  :  ,Providing_information
ok i get factorofsafety of  5  and ms of  7 ,Providing_information
Cus thats our weak point rn,Providing_information
The crankshaft by far has the most mass,Providing_information
They asked and I gave them  40 mm  I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them  and they have not responded,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
I haven t changed anything in the last five min,Providing_information
No,Providing_information
im not sure if everyone is on board ,Providing_information
yeah they say they cant decrease it any more,Providing_information
increase in either variable causes both the mass and factorofsafety to go up,Providing_information
our factorofsafety still needs to go up,Providing_information
Okay I mass using my results for  80 ,Providing_information
still mass  equals to   9   86  and factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 ,Providing_information
hahah this is rough,Providing_information
i have set it to those values,Providing_information
Ok cool,Providing_information
crankshaft is  2   11  but they say they cant decrease it anymore,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
i wont move mine again,Providing_information
Now it is  80 ,Providing_information
I think it s dependent on the flywheel  crankshaft  and connecting rod values at this point,Providing_information
Yeah  I mass upto  2   62  now  But remember  its the minimum of all the factorofsafety that matters the most ,Providing_information
okay  i havent updated in awhile,Providing_information
I think so,Providing_information
yes,Providing_information
right,Providing_information
Thats fine ,Providing_information
We are good on mass,Providing_information
 12  and  60 ,Providing_information
by the way  I can get an fs of  10   19  if you go down to  75 ,Providing_information
 12  for flywheelthickness and  60  for flywheeldiameter,Providing_information
so I have two variables,Providing_information
That would be my guess too ,Providing_information
I am at the time we got the best result now,Providing_information
one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
 1   94 ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
I think I have the easiest part lol  No one s asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them,Providing_information
Okay  I played around with it at the beginning and I don t think my factorofsafety has a huge affect on the overall factorofsafety  My mass is only  3   17   and my factorofsafety is at  2   That s where I thought I would keep it for now ,Providing_information
and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
nope  haven t broadcasted in a bit  The most I can change the wieght is by like  3  anyways,Providing_information
Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same,Providing_information
No,Providing_information
I haven t changed my dimensions for awhile now  hope that helps,Providing_information
diameter is  80 ,Providing_information
they have not been changed for the last  10  minutes,Providing_information
Based on their mass of  1   66   they take up half the weight of the system  So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important ,Providing_information
mass  8   84  factorofsafety  4   39 ,Providing_information
Can you change flywheeldiameter to  55  and braodcast,Providing_information
ok that s good,Providing_information
 1   64 ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
these are the same values I had for the  very good  design,Providing_information
I think that is an average of each designer s parts which is why I think someone s dimensions aren,Providing_information
nice,Providing_information
Ah okay  gotcha,Providing_information
we can both move  i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it,Providing_information
Ok,Providing_information
arent lining up,Providing_information
Will do ,Providing_information
 5   75     75 ,Providing_information
no,Providing_information
 6   61   80 ,Providing_information
I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 ,Providing_information
yeah one sec,Providing_information
maybe my part doesn t matter,Providing_information
Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment,Providing_information
The TA guy said its the lowest value between us,Providing_information
Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment,Providing_information
Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment,Providing_information
ya  try  75 ,Providing_information
I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 ,Providing_information
 1   3  and mass is too high,Providing_information
ok,Providing_information
I just broadcasted  10    15   and  60 ,Providing_information
 44    1   29 ,Providing_information
just did it,Providing_information
everyone else has remained the same values,Providing_information

it has a low factorofsafety for my part but it doesn t seem like mine really makes a difference,Providing_information
will do,Providing_information
Thanks,Providing_information
just changed diameter to  80  and got factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 ,Providing_information
yes  piston bore is  80 ,Providing_information
piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now,Providing_information
piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now,Providing_information
I think the lowest factorofsafety is what is broadcasted,Providing_information
nah  we only have  2  mins left,Providing_information
piston can increase factorofsafety if i move pistonborediameter  equals to   75   we are going to both adjust it now,Providing_information
impressive,Providing_information
I don t think that s right,Providing_information
Diameter  equals to   40  mm,Providing_information
gotcha,Providing_information
I mass pretty sure no one depends on my variables though,Providing_information
Diameter  equals to   40 mm,Providing_information
our mass just went up  20 kg ,Providing_information

it would increase my factorofsafety some,Providing_information
But weight is  25 ,Providing_information
yep,Providing_information
factorofsafety _ s :   1653   92  ; ,Providing_information
It is updated  That s my current broadcast ,Providing_information
didnt change anything,Providing_information
We re close  guys,Providing_information
yea I am doing that rn,Providing_information
I mean  its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads  So that s normal ,Providing_information
currently  1   64 ,Providing_information
that looks good,Providing_information
yes   40 ,Providing_information
I can try,Providing_information
TRUE,Providing_information
 2   79 ,Providing_information
yeah that is what im using,Providing_information
I can minimize my diameter,Providing_information
Nope,Providing_information
to  15 ,Providing_information
ok never mind then,Providing_information
slightly,Providing_information
okay,Providing_information
im at  75 ,Providing_information

Sorry I just mine back to  25 ,Providing_information
only the crankshaft offset,Providing_information
ok no one anything,Providing_information
uf,Providing_information
ok no one anything,Providing_information
ok no one anything,Providing_information
ok no one anything,Providing_information
increase it to  50 ,Providing_information
its at  12   lowest,Providing_information
raise it a little like  20 ,Providing_information
quality just went down to poor for me  seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything ? ,Asking_for_information
how much weight can you reduce roughly,Asking_for_information
yeah  leave yours in a safe config,Asking_for_information
how much weight can you trim  generally ,Asking_for_information
That s ok  I control the conrod length to crank length ratio  r 1   does that affect you in any way ? ,Asking_for_information
alright  guess not then,Asking_for_information
wait what,Asking_for_information
What s the best you can do with a flywheel shaft diameter of  45  ? ,Asking_for_information
Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft,Asking_for_information
Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod,Asking_for_information
Thanks  I mass good on my end  Is there anything you need from my end ? ,Asking_for_information
Yes  that is when I used piston bore diameter of  105 ,Asking_for_information
tell me if it s better to use greater value because  40 mm is the minimum value,Asking_for_information
Im gonna do  150  instead,Asking_for_information
Would a larger bore work better for you ?  I could go to about  45  but beyond that  my factorofsafety goes below  1   7   My factorofsafety is currently at  3   44  with a bore of  40 ,Asking_for_information
yeah  the diameter,Asking_for_information
or she,Asking_for_information
yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly,Asking_for_information
Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well ,Asking_for_information

Our mass is too high  can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those ?   sending this to the others as well ,Asking_for_information
and what ive been telling the others hahah,Asking_for_information
ya go ahead and change it back  can you lower pistonborediameter any more ? ,Asking_for_information
Lower pistonborediameter works better for both me and the rod designer  do you know how it affects the flywheel or crankshaft ? ,Asking_for_information
ya we just lowered it all the way  how are your numbers,Asking_for_information
ya the factorofsafety is so bad,Asking_for_information
yes sir  or maam ,Asking_for_information
they said they ddnt,Asking_for_information
i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little  try to change your numbers slightly maybe ? ,Asking_for_information
i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little  try to change your numbers slightly maybe ? ,Asking_for_information
man what happened,Asking_for_information
WHO THE HELL KEEPS MOVING IT TO POOR,Asking_for_information
whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg,Asking_for_information
whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg,Asking_for_information
yup  will do  ;  ,Asking_for_information
your variables affect the other measurements,Asking_for_information
Let s not change whatever we have,Asking_for_information
Let s not change whatever we have,Asking_for_information
Let s not change whatever we have,Asking_for_information
Let s not change whatever we have,Asking_for_information
I think you and I have the most influence over total mass  What is your current mass and factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
so maybe try lowering your factorofsafety a lil bit with smaller mass,Asking_for_information
anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the factorofsafety too much ? ,Asking_for_information
Cause I ve been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter,Asking_for_information
idk what changed but quality just dropped,Asking_for_information
talk to flywheel as that would be the heaviest bit ? ,Asking_for_information
Does increasing bearingoffset increase the mass or decrease,Asking_for_information
I mass trying to while considering what piston did,Asking_for_information
Hey  I need value of crankshaft bearing offset,Asking_for_information
Hey  I need value of crankshaft bearing offset,Asking_for_information
Increasing that will allow my factor of safety to increase  Any reason we re keeping it low ? ,Asking_for_information
It doesn t as far as I know  but the length of the crankshaft does  What is your current value for r ? ,Asking_for_information
okay  you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger,Asking_for_information
can you reduce mass but keep factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Asking_for_information
Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the factorofsafety just above  2  ? ,Asking_for_information
even in the case by case basis  the higher the factorofsafety the better,Asking_for_information
Do it  Make mass as small as possible while still sitting above  2  ,Asking_for_information
The mass increased alot do you know why,Asking_for_information
I need :  piston bore diameter,Asking_for_information
i need :  piston bore diameter,Asking_for_information
idk what im doing at the moment,Asking_for_information
bearingoffset bc yes,Asking_for_information
lower bore diameter ?  on it  I ll go down to  55  and see what we can get,Asking_for_information
Ok but what about the chart,Asking_for_information
We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
We have  0   15  mass to play with  What options do you have for that which could increase factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
and i think pistonborediameter,Asking_for_information
can you share all your variables,Asking_for_information
can you lower the r values,Asking_for_information
pistonborediameter,Asking_for_information
Can you change piston diamter without affecting your factorofsafety and mass much ?  With the current diamteter my max factorofsafety is only  0   51 ,Asking_for_information
ok i increased dc and it got better ? ,Asking_for_information
yes but then mass would increadse,Asking_for_information
yessir,Asking_for_information
just to see is it the one with the lowest ms and highest factorofsafety in the far right column ? ,Asking_for_information
okay im at max factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
okay im at max factorofsafety,Asking_for_information
Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value,Asking_for_information
Is either flywheelthickness or flywheeldiameter a variable of other subsystems for you ? ,Asking_for_information
Can you find a way to increase the factorofsafety for your component ? ,Asking_for_information
what up,Asking_for_information
Whats up,Asking_for_information
wait i wonder if the third guy is against the wall too,Asking_for_information
but imma find em,Asking_for_information
there ya go,Asking_for_information
whats the lowest highest mass and factorofsafety for you,Asking_for_information
If you reduce factorofsafety to around  2   can we reduce weight ? ,Asking_for_information
It s all good now  Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety  greater than  2   ? ,Asking_for_information
 greater than  :  ,Asking_for_information
We need to work on factorofsafety  Is it just an average of all the factor of safetys ? ,Asking_for_information
so lmk if it stays at  150 ,Asking_for_information
sheesh that s high  have you found a good sweet spot between mass and factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
Could yo uoptimize your factorofsafety ?  I think your weight is mainly negligible,Asking_for_information
The crankshaft takes up the most amount in terms of mass but is it possible to lower the value any further than  2   43  ? ,Asking_for_information
Can you decrease bearingoffset to  60  and see what you get ? ,Asking_for_information
can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? ,Asking_for_information
can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? ,Asking_for_information
can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that ? ,Asking_for_information
we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there,Providing_information
looking at that now,Providing_information
shows it as broadcasting for me,Providing_information
based on the little chart they gave us our design should be at excellent,Providing_information
mine are actually better than when it was excellent,Providing_information
Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast ,Providing_information
Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast ,Providing_information
We re still seeing  80  as the globally broadcast value  Weird ,Providing_information
Good working with you too,Providing_information
working on it,Providing_information
Make sure to broad cast variables,Providing_information
i feel like we care about the lowest factorofsafety of all subsystems,Providing_information
Ok  I mass talking to the crankshaft guy to figure out how it affects his factorofsafety because he is the one with the lowest factorofsafety right now,Providing_information
ok run again with values when you were getting good,Providing_information
try using  50  mm,Providing_information
try using  50  mm,Providing_information
make sure to broadcast,Providing_information
factorofsafety went up,Providing_information
We are good  he said his factorofsafety went up when I changed it down to  45 ,Providing_information
I am the flywheel  and would like to know about the  Crankshaft bearing offset  when you make a decision on it ,Providing_information
currently  55  mm unless you think a better value could be used,Providing_information
is this scooter,Providing_information
we need to work on making the design much lighter though if thats possible with your part,Providing_information
let me check,Providing_information
try that,Providing_information
these are the variables I need to consider for design,Providing_information
because any factorofsafety over like  10  shouldnt really effect the system right,Providing_information
We need factorofsafety to increase now,Providing_information
try not to change anything until you talk to someone,Providing_information
try not to change anything until you talk to someone,Providing_information
If you changed anything since we got FAIR  please change it back  Then we can regroup and figure out next steps   sending this to everyone ,Providing_information

it doesnt matter if youre not the min factorofsafety,Providing_information
our global factorofsafety just the lowest part factorofsafety you think,Providing_information
Yeah i figured that out when mine was lowest lol,Providing_information
in order to optimize our results,Providing_information
maybe we need to be secret,Providing_information
just remember what you have now,Providing_information

someone touched it,Providing_information
you can change it and change it back if it gets worse,Providing_information
let me change around and see what i got,Providing_information
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Providing_information
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Providing_information
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Providing_information
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Providing_information
agree,Providing_information
yeah same,Providing_information
I remember the parameter I had,Providing_information
Okay we are at,Providing_information
they said they didnt change it,Providing_information
you should probably ask him her,Providing_information
ok if its the same as what we had at excellent then it should be fine but it isnt,Providing_information
i meant for your individual part,Providing_information
My strategy was to pick the part with lowest weight and factor of safety above  2 ,Providing_information
Okay sounds good,Providing_information
Lets not change it,Providing_information
Lets not change it now,Providing_information
Lets not change it now,Providing_information
Lets not change it now,Providing_information
You good to leave,Providing_information
maybe we should just call it good,Providing_information
I don t know if I can get a factorofsafety over  1  with that diameter,Providing_information
We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable,Providing_information
We need to increase factorofsafety somehow,Providing_information
Try broadcasting  80 ,Providing_information
same sounds good,Providing_information
your part seems pretty light how large can you make the factorofsafety,Providing_information
I think bearingoffset needs to be changed,Providing_information
im going to try to change it to get factorofsafety higher and yeah I broadcasted,Providing_information
okay sounds good,Providing_information
It seems like larger pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety,Providing_information
okay sounds good,Providing_information
it is yeah,Providing_information
It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now  in terms of mass and factorofsafety,Providing_information
looks like we re good,Providing_information
looks like we re good,Providing_information
You could reduce the factorofsafety value since they are looking for the component with the smallest factorofsafety value,Providing_information
we need to get below  3  kg for the factorofsafety to really matter at this point,Providing_information
our quality just went way down  so if you changed anything try to change it back,Providing_information
working on it,Providing_information
We do,Providing_information
try increasing factorofsafety,Providing_information
let me check,Providing_information
dope,Providing_information
We need to increase factorofsafety,Providing_information
hey i think that made things better ,Providing_information
makes it way worse,Providing_information
we ve gotta figure out how all the other factors connect,Providing_information
okay  so you part and my part are the heaviest,Providing_information
there,Providing_information
try that,Providing_information
It might be worth it to converse with them to see if you can get a better factorofsafety  I feel like if one part has a much lower factorofsafety than the others  it ll hinder the overall build,Providing_information
I think factorofsafety might depend on me then,Providing_information
once you figure it out,Providing_information
greatjob,Providing_information
gotta be inclusive gosh,Providing_information
They just told me their factorofsafety is very high,Providing_information
piston thinks youre suspicious ,Providing_information
great factorofsafety right now,Providing_information

make it higher,Providing_information
for bearingoffset,Providing_information
Alright thanks,Providing_information
we need to get this puppy down,Providing_information
ooooo it went down but so did factorofsafety,Providing_information
We re going in the wrong direction for both,Providing_information
alright thanks ,Providing_information
try working more with factorofsafety if you can  Ours is so low,Providing_information
It is,Providing_information
because the overall mass and factorofsafety are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago  now they re horrible lol,Providing_information
I just dont know why our factorofsafety is so low,Providing_information
Looks like were close again now,Providing_information
Nevermind we getting there ,Providing_information
Hey  we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier ,Providing_information
Hey  we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier ,Providing_information
go for it,Providing_information

Hello piston  based on my information  it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and maximize flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  Does this work with your design requirements ? ,Asking_for_information
I was going to start out with  70   Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter ? ,Asking_for_information
Thanks for checking in but I am all set in terms of needed values  Is there anything on my end I should send over ? ,Asking_for_information
I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information

I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
I am going to increase the piston diameter  could you tell me if that increases or decreases your factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
can you go lower in weight while still being high factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
I don t think so  maybe try to find an factorofsafety closer to  2  and reduce the mass ? ,Asking_for_information
Can you set the piston bore diameter to  85  and get a good factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? ,Asking_for_information
For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? ,Asking_for_information
For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  and pistonborediameter  equals to   85   what are the minimum masses you can have for a factorofsafety of  2  ? ,Asking_for_information
It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting factorofsafety  Maybe close to   6  ? ,Asking_for_information
Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest factorofsafety will fail first  so they re factorofsafety is the most important  What do you think ? ,Asking_for_information

so I mass thinking the factorofsafety of the system is the lowest factorofsafety of any individual subsystem  can you try to increase factorofsafety ? ,Asking_for_information
it looks like someone changed the mass to be wrong but yea,Providing_information
can you change it just to see,Providing_information
the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
lets try that,Providing_information
yeah change it back,Providing_information
Our factorofsafety went up,Providing_information
They said they pistonborediameter broadcast it  but yeah  still  80   IDK what s going on ,Providing_information
will let you know in few minutes,Providing_information
will let you know in few minutes,Providing_information
Nope  let me know if you need anything,Providing_information
correct,Providing_information
so don t think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does,Providing_information
Hi  I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me,Providing_information

Hey  just want to make sure that the bearing offset is still  70  mm,Providing_information
also broadcast those  I am not using your variables others might,Providing_information
piston told me  crankshaft want him to have miximum diameter,Providing_information
so my guess is that if you re higher than  2  you re good,Providing_information
I thought that the factorofsafety on top is our total global factorofsafety,Providing_information
man  0   09  factorofsafety lol,Providing_information
you need to broadcast your simulation results  after simulating  you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results,Providing_information
Same,Providing_information
I think someone s trying to get excellent,Providing_information
try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin factorofsafety remains above  2 ,Providing_information
Same,Providing_information
and broadcast the design,Providing_information
or it,Providing_information
Anything you need from me yet,Providing_information
can you try broadcasting it since we are over  12  kg,Providing_information
 same,Providing_information
ya I need the piston to change the bore diameter so I can see how if effects my numbers,Providing_information
The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
thanks  can you try increasing it to around  97   5  or something  Im trying to see how it effects my numbers,Providing_information
Yeah a lower pistonborediameter gives me better numbers,Providing_information
can you try to reduce flywheelthickness at all,Providing_information
everything is good now but why is it still fair,Providing_information
great question  but it is all legitimate,Providing_information
go back to what you had bc we were at good,Providing_information
go back to what you had bc we were at good,Providing_information

okay wait,Providing_information
lets gooo,Providing_information
Bcause it changes other peoples factorofsafety properties,Providing_information
select  ,Providing_information
No  looks like that L and r are different than mine ,Providing_information
Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 ,Providing_information
Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 ,Providing_information
If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with factorofsafety less then  2 ,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw,Providing_information
Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw,Providing_information
Lowest factorofsafety is the system factorofsafety btw,Providing_information
we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then,Providing_information
but that might change the system actually,Providing_information
I only care about the crankshaft persons decisions,Providing_information
our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me  can you try and get them to talk to me  :   I need to discuss values with them,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
Maybe ask around,Providing_information
same here,Providing_information
Okay I ll let you know what I get,Providing_information
lets leave it like this,Providing_information
keep me posted on your diameter broadcast so I can update mine,Providing_information
mass shot up  we back to very good did you change,Providing_information
mass shot up  we back to very good did you change,Providing_information

im at what ive always been at,Providing_information
im at what ive always been at,Providing_information

I mean something changed and made it go back down to very good  but I didn t change anything  did you ? ,Providing_information
try making your factorofsafety high because i think that is really hurting the oveerall factorofsafety,Providing_information
thinking about changing it to  55 ,Providing_information
any ideas to get bumped up,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
I think you need to try changing that variable and seeing if you can get a higher factorofsafety,Providing_information
while keeping the factorofsafety fixed,Providing_information
Make sure your part s factorofsafety isnt the same as the sub system s  If it is  increase it slightly,Providing_information
same here,Providing_information
same same,Providing_information
I was asked to keep my parameters constant,Providing_information
same here,Providing_information
Keep your factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
Keep your factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
lets try that,Providing_information
try to find a good combination at pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Providing_information

Oh okay  Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team,Providing_information
So far as I can tell  I just need to make sure that this number is smaller than your flywheel thickness,Providing_information
After you run a simulation you can broadcast a simulaiton,Providing_information
the simulation results for me show the subsystem factorofsafety,Providing_information
im just telling you you need to start hustlin,Providing_information
for subsytsem,Providing_information
so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your factorofsafety,Providing_information
seems like the sim values factorofsafety over weight as far as getting from  fair  to  good ,Providing_information
Same ,Providing_information
But factorofsafety is low,Providing_information
keep trying iterations,Providing_information
that s what the piston guy is saying,Providing_information
and see what happens,Providing_information
lets get this bread,Providing_information
any preference on the piston bore diameter,Providing_information
Okay  then you can do what you need to increase the factorofsafety  then let me know the new pistonborediameter,Providing_information
Hi I dont think I need parameters from you ,Providing_information
but we can try to imporve,Providing_information
I can adjust thickness to have a required factorofsafety at a specific pistonborediameter,Providing_information
yes  as high as we can get factorofsafety the better,Providing_information
but piston pin designer has lopw factorofsafety,Providing_information
Not sure where the mass increase came from,Providing_information
but our system factorofsafety is  1   25 ,Providing_information
SAme,Providing_information
Go back to your last brasodcast values  You just fucked the factorofsafety,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
my variables depend on piston bore diameter,Providing_information
So we need to get min mass and max factorofsafety,Providing_information
but we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think,Providing_information
I think its cause when anyone else changes their numberss it effects the other numbers,Providing_information
with the different simulation numbers,Providing_information
Idk if we have certain rounds or not,Providing_information
wait so I asked piston to lower his mass  So now my factorofsafety is lowered to  70  ,Providing_information
make sure crank shaft guy knows that and try to figure out how an increase or decrease in that effect the factorofsafety and the mass,Providing_information
I get better values when it is smaller,Providing_information
and factorofsafety,Providing_information
but we need to increase factor of saftey,Providing_information
no i know but i was just seeing who had what,Providing_information
Mine only changes when yours change lol,Providing_information
Yeah I was about to ask that and i think you are right,Providing_information
Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes,Providing_information
Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes,Providing_information
Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes,Providing_information
yeah if it lowers factorofsafety too much  weshouldnt,Providing_information
Let s update eveyone with new mass and factorofsafety whenever we make changes,Providing_information
try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our factorofsafety significantly,Providing_information
same,Providing_information
so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety,Providing_information
a little someone else is messing around with their factorofsafety,Providing_information
so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety,Providing_information
so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety,Providing_information
so basically whatever my factorofsafety is is what our system factorofsafety is  we need to find a way to increase my max factorofsafety,Providing_information
but the far right column is the projected values for them and I think the ideal broadcast is the one with the best projected values,Providing_information
So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably,Providing_information
if i make the piston diameter smaller  my factorofsafety goes up,Providing_information
y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 ,Providing_information
y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 ,Providing_information
y all we need to get the factorofsafety to  2 ,Providing_information
go for the lower Ms that has an factorofsafety above  2 ,Providing_information
great minds think alike,Providing_information
lets not change anything and get that   20 ,Providing_information
Lets not change anything and get that   20 ,Providing_information
 he or she,Providing_information
Lets not change anything and get that   20 ,Providing_information
Lets not change anything and get that   20 ,Providing_information
i dont know the piston diameter,Providing_information
The only way i can get higher factorofsafety is if piston diameter pistonborediameter is  43  is lower,Providing_information
then we will see how the factorofsafety changes,Providing_information
but i backed you up,Providing_information
I know  but the weight is higher for my other options above  2 ,Providing_information
ok make sure your factorofsafety is never below  2 ,Providing_information
slim if you can without chaning your factorofsafety,Providing_information
but ive decided im gonna focus more on  352  bc its a heavier weighted class,Providing_information
awesome factorofsafety,Providing_information
slim if you can without changing your factorofsafety,Providing_information
slim if you can without altering your factorofsafety at all,Providing_information
like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition,Providing_information
this looks like some weird morse code,Providing_information
My weight is around  0   1  so I can t change it much ? ,Providing_information
Our factorofsafety dipped again,Providing_information
Ok  right now my r 2  is  0   5  and r 3  is  0   2   Is that what you need ? ,Providing_information
If we could lower the offset  that would optimize my factorofsafety,Providing_information
okay change the other things too,Providing_information
Great - let me know if you need anything from me,Providing_information
But factorofsafety is too low,Providing_information
ok the lower you have it the higher my factorofsafety,Providing_information
yea it is,Providing_information
holy cow someone is making major changes,Providing_information
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back,Providing_information
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back,Providing_information
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac,Providing_information
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac,Providing_information
Maybe  not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up,Providing_information
See if you can bump that up,Providing_information
Same,Providing_information
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Providing_information
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Providing_information
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Providing_information
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Providing_information
so someone is low,Providing_information
Let me know if you do switch so I can update the broadcast  I found good values,Providing_information
Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are,Providing_information
Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are,Providing_information
Put your values to your lowest mass and highest factorofsafety right now please  I want to get an overall view of where we are,Providing_information
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Providing_information
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Providing_information
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Providing_information
Ok  someone changed something and made it much worse,Providing_information
please please try and get those sorted out ASAP and let me know if you need anything  look at all your already run simulations and pick out the lowest mass and factorofsafety then set your values to those,Providing_information
Ok  I ll ask them if so and then we can go from there  That looks like a hard simulation to run ,Providing_information
Interesting  the mass is what is hurting us but the factorofsafety is beautifull,Providing_information
if u want to adjust urs  u can announce to all chats,Providing_information
okay  try and get the factorofsafety even higher - we need to at least meet one of these criteria,Providing_information
yep trying my best now - we need to meet at least one of the criteria,Providing_information
Same,Providing_information
ya  seems like we have agreement on that,Providing_information
should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall,Providing_information
I asked the guy  he said it was normal,Providing_information
You have to update your broadcast and look at the total factorofsafety and mass,Providing_information
I ve been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing pistonborediameter  but I haven t gotten any response ,Asking_for_information
I am considering the piston diameter and the piston head thickness,Asking_for_information
should I try to lean toward factorofsafety since my masses are about  1  to  4  and factorofsafety ranges are   5  to  3  ish ? ,Asking_for_information
Let s try to get all the other engineers to work on high factorofsafety even if masses are high,Asking_for_information
I mass trying to find out what everyone s factorofsafety is  crankshafter has theirs at  3   62 ,Asking_for_information
I agree  My part increases in weight linearly and increases in factorofsafety exponentially so its probably better to maximize it  Do you have a part that increases in factorofsafety only linearly ?  you can see it on the graphs,Asking_for_information
Do what you need to do to get factorofsafety  greater than   1   5  and then we can adjust masses from there,Asking_for_information
Aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize mass and have a shot at the  very good  or  excellent  marks  is there anything you need from me ? ,Asking_for_information
Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead,Asking_for_information
Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead,Asking_for_information
Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead,Asking_for_information
Lets all maximize our factorofsafety and try to cut mass instead,Asking_for_information
factorofsafety could increase with increase in mass but if it s already so high I don t think it matters  right ? ,Asking_for_information
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? ,Providing_information
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? ,Providing_information
get you factor of safety as close to  2 ,Providing_information
