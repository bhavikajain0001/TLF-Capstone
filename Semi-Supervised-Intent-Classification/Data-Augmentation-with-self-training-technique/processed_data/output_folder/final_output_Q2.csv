because if you increase to your pistonborediameter what does that somehow do justice to mass?,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
or do you need me help to adjust up anything to make yours work?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
did that you change half the tire diameter because mine says 80 but at just 105 it was excellent,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Ok  and we want to increase factorofsafety and decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
6 r w 2 equals 10 to 0 5 r 3 equals 0 to 0 2 l and at pistonborediameter equals 2 to 40 this gives in mass 2 equals to 0 12 r and factorofsafety rate equals to 3 44,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I decreased flywheeldiameter to  15  mm to conserve some mass  as my factorofsafety values are all greater than  300 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
individually  2   47 ,Monitoring_objective_values
is there anyway you could lower the weight and factorofsafety to just above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

no because it went down to fair  the mass went up a lot,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I decreased my weight parameter a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
that only depends on what the initial thickness of the piston size is for me if so i keep raising it about the same and decrease it so the mass goes halfway down but so does the factor thus of safety i mass trying to get it at around 2 w lowest mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
and right now i likely have received a total mass loss of 1 ≤ 49 and factorofsafety of 4 × 55 which appears now to still be good via rubric,Monitoring_objective_values

I mass currently at  40  mm diameter  which is giving me better results than the  45  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
so my personal factorofsafety is 4 55 1 and my own personal parameter of selection minimizes our mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Based on my simulations  it seems like a smaller value of  bearingoffset  will result in an overall higher factorofsafety  do you agree ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
however was there a particular reason to why once you asked about him maxing the out flywheeldiameter?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
i don t exactly think creating that one was all my intention doing i have been seen broadcasting factorofsafety values around 8,Monitoring_objective_values
i mass not the only sad one that is really changing,Monitoring_objective_values
section 45 seems decent,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
remember how appreciable that is the significant change in his mass if if you prioritize one factorofsafety?,Tradeoff_between_objectives
In that case it would be more valuable to keep the lower flywheeldiameter value to conserve mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Think I optimized my part with mass  equals to    52  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
some just reduced thickness to help reduce mass increased internal factorofsafety a little bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
did you change the diameter because mine says  80   but at  105  it was excellent,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
can you not put yours back down to use before when it was somewhat excellent? i think theres some underlying dependency that makes it go down bad,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i think... we must have excellent quality right now,Monitoring_objective_values
now i have decreased my weight parameter a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it affects the design variable bearingoffset which the length of radius the the bearing ball support cannot offset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your diameter at currently ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
just updated my broadcast  Mass of mine is  1   49 ,Monitoring_objective_values
just updated my broadcast mass rating of a mine is 1 h 49,Monitoring_objective_values
what value works that best if for your simulation?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
but yeah the entire overall internal mass went up so fast i mass about to go raise my mass quickly and simply drop the factorofsafety one of the various other designers asked me about to,Tradeoff_between_objectives
or any risk factorofsafety was higher than 1 2 gets us nothing until more we need to drop mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
do you change the piston diameter at all,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Its at  2   83  rn for me,Monitoring_objective_values
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
who s factorofsafety changed,Monitoring_objective_values
How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we are at excellent agian,Monitoring_objective_values
who has found the factorofsafety as of code 57? we sure need to work together on increasing that,Monitoring_objective_values
but i therefore don t change that i only do change bearingoffset that and a pistonborediameter _ for bearingoffset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
all my factorofsafety values are in the hundreds  i suspect it depends a lot on bearingoffset,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
well hello professor have i you determined what you would like the standard piston bore or diameter pistonborediameter to now be?,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
who s factorofsafety changed ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright  what factorofsafety  s are you getting  my lowest factorofsafety situation is still  323 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
if i successfully reduce even my mass by 03 then it reduces its factorofsafety by nearly 25 to 1 76,Tradeoff_between_objectives
9 ok my factorofsafety values range up from 1 kb to 8,Monitoring_objective_values
what can you see if all you increase from your bore of diamater to 41 levels or 42 as if it improves anything?,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
you let me know now if i can adjust my variables accordingly to better mentally suite your requirements,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I just lowered it to  25   23   That is low for the crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

i have both found my values fully and optimized,Tradeoff_between_objectives

If I reduce my mass by   03   it reduces factorofsafety by   25  to  1   76 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we re only trying desperately to keep factorofsafety alive over this 2 months right?,Monitoring_objective_values
someone who s the factorofsafety changed,Monitoring_objective_values
ok do what that you can,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello piston  based on my information  it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and maximize flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter  Does this work with your design requirements ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
don t know if we can stop or if we have to go the full  45  minutes,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I can get mine up to  3   44  max where pistonborediameter  equals to   40 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
it keeps changing for me  but none of the Key Design variables change,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much weight can you trim  generally ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i only depend on the piston,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter  connecting rod thickness  and connecting rod length ratio,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
pistonborediameter is min at  40  I think,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
And i have the connection rod length ratio at the minimum,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
  52   it s minimized,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
we can optimize bearingoffset and flywheelthickness looks like,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
like a higher bearingoffset,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Let me decrease my thickness a bit,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset equals to  60   dc equals to  15 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
what is your mass when you maximize your flywheel diameter and thickness,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
so If i maximize both my design variables,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the piston-pin,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I used  40  mm which is the minimum value I can use,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
piston bore diameter affects both crankshaft and conrods  variables,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
basically bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to  15 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I chose  40 mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it s good for him or her if I use maximum value,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset  equals to   85  and dc  equals to   15 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually  So we cannot optimize that part ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
my factor of safety is maximized at low bearingoffset values,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter  so I used  70 mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
you need to broadcast your simulation results  after simulating  you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Can you try and minimize your bearing offset ?  I mass getting the best results for a bearing offset of  60 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I currently have pistonborediameter set at  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It looks like im better off with a smaller piston diamter if you can make that work,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter  do those affect yours ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
thanks  can you try increasing it to around  97   5  or something  Im trying to see how it effects my numbers,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I can lower it to  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i don t believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
or reduced offset i should say,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
it costs money,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
 1   23  is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
that s the highest,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
bearingoffset equals to  150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
i determine bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yes  i design the bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we can tone it down some still,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we can tone it down some still,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we can tone it down some still,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
my current bearingoffset i  150  and dc of  30 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Ok let me know if you change that because it will effect my design,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston diameter  pistonborediameter  is currently  105   not variable I control,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yea  idk who changed a value  If we cant figure it out  I can lower the piston  4  pounds,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
i mass determining bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
the current optimal bearingoffset and dc i got that yields best results is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   50 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
pistom-pin designer says increase the diameter,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
the bearingoffset and dc i currently have yields best factorofsafety which is  2   283  but it s not the lightest,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
mine only goes up to  30  max,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Don t worry  you re a pistonpin you can do anything,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I may change it back to  55  though if that works with yours ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
my current value is bearingoffset  equals to   150  and dc  equals to   45 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
crankshaft is talking  but he she depends on flywheel,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yea lets not change any more variables,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I was asked to keep my parameters constant,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
it is at  150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Well it s between  40  and  70  so maybe like  55  to start ?  I ll run some simulations,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Are you in charge of the variable bearingoffset ?  Is it more beneficial to maximize or minimize it ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Yea  it s better to minimize bearingoffset,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same  but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but factorofsafety is reduced,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
So maybe having a higher bearing offset is a good idea,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
so that makes it  600  for connector lenght,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
that was with r 2  at   5   r 3  at  7  and pistonborediameter at  40 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
i can do  40  easy,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Actually  that doesn t make any sense  since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is  150 mm  and your maximum flywheel thickness is  51 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Can you do that ?  Right now its at  50 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
or does it at all,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
increasing your the bearing offset only reduces the factorofsafety so im keeping it at  150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
 75  is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
im trying to broadcast with bearingoffset equals to  130 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
you can maximize the crank shaft bearing support offset if it benefits your design  it decreases my factorofsafety but my factorofsafety is so high that it doesnt matter much,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
meant decrease thickness and lower the weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
new bearingoffset is broadcast,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
it is the lowest diameter i could do,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset was changed to  80 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I think bearingoffset needs to be changed,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I dont have control over it  I think its you and the piston  Seems to me like the low  80  range was working best though but Im not sure,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
In pistonborediameter  equals to   75  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i have control over neither  only bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I reduced the diameter to  40 mm to reduce the mass of the system,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
The smaller offset works well for smaller flywheel dimensions but the factorofsafety is higher overall with larger dimensions,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we can see how good his her part is with  45  and increase if necessary,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
length of pin  diameter of piston  higher is better ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I don t have control over that  I believe that s the piston ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
my objective is to maximize it,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
 2   95  is my minimum  I can t go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Yes  that s the minimum diameter I can use,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
under performance requirements,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yes   75  works for me and piston,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
if you increase the diameter,Dependencies_between_design_parameters

I control the diameter of the piston head and the thickness of the piston head,Dependencies_between_design_parameters

I can set the piston bore diameter at either  40    47   5    55    62   5   and  70 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Increasing bearingoffset only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start  Do you need it bigger greater than ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset bc yes,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
same  60  is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
My best values on both charts have bearingoffset equals to  60  in common,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
That s the minimum,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Just did max   105  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try reducing bearingoffset ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
mine depends on crankshaft,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
is  60  the minimum you can go with the crankshaft,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
can you get it to  60  ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
so bearingoffset low ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
it s not set to the lowest atm,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok back to lowest bearingoffset,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you share your variable letters  what you control and what you need ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
do you depend on my variables ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
i depend on the piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
bearingoffset  equals to   150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
 82   5  i was thinking  the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston controls it,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
and piston diameter will affect my performance quality,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Can you lower your diameter a touch ?  My options depend only on that ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
next smallest i can go to is  75  and thats the minimum,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
okay  the bearing support offset should be minimized for my part and an increasing crank pin diameter increases my factorofsafety,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
let me reduce the pistonborediameter to  40 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
It looks a little better now,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
If you need to increase up to  42  thats possible,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
do it,Dependencies_between_design_parameters

The bearing support off set that is ideal for me is  40 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
on my screen it says your limit is between  150  and  300  ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Should have gone through ?  bearingoffset equals to   150   dc equals to  50 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
ok i will lessen the thickness ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If we could lower the offset  that would optimize my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
nevermind i am at the minimum thickness setting,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I change it to  80  now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I have bearingoffset and dc what do you control ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
No  it should still be at  40 mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
yeah  i dont think i can change diameter because it will affect everyone,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I currently have it at the lowest   150  am trying to run simulation to see how it affects the output values,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so lmk if it stays at  150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Currently have a simulation at bearingoffset equals to  150   dc equals to  50  flywheeldiameter equals to  40  flywheelthickness equals to  51  pistonborediameter equals to  105  with projected output ms equals to  23   24  and factorofsafety equals to  3   96 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
maybe try and adjust again to find a balance,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
so for you design a lower bearingoffset is better ?  does dc affect yours at all ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
if I change it to  75   will it affect your design,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
does your design depend on the flywheel at all ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Yeah it is either him or the flywheel,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
If you need the offset to be higher let me know ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Can you decrease bearingoffset to  60  and see what you get ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
What happens when you decrease piston diameter ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
We had a very good one at  80  before,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
ah  change it back to  80  then ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I can lower my diameter more if you need it,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
bearingoffset :  150  dc :  50 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
I change it back to  80  since the overall results for  75  are not good,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
you re going to keep it at  80  ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I can minimize my diameter,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
only the crankshaft offset,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we should aim for a smaller total mass  it s a little close to  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

it keeps changing for me  but none of the Key Design variables change,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much weight can you reduce roughly,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think its the piston changing but not sure,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
My weight varies between  0   0  and  0   12  so im the wrong person to reduce weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
keep it up and we ll trim from there,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much weight can you trim  generally ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
piston pin affects factorofsafety most but can t trim much weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
We need to have the heavy parts drop mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
are you limited by pistonborediameter to determine L ?  we may be able to increase pistonborediameter and reduc eL for a weigh tsavings ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
most of the mass is in the crank  I think you and the crank have some dependency on one another,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i only depend on the piston,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we may reduce pistonborediameter just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
sounds good but do you have any more room to reduce mass ?  I mass about the smallest I can make my parts,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
Same  Minimizing the piston bore would help me push stuff further down ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
don t change the broadcast  but if you simulate a minim weight situation  what s the savings ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
the program won t let me go any lower,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
same here  it would reduce my masses a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
does changing bearingoffset save any mass ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yeah  working with crankshaft to reduce if it saves mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If you increase the piston bore diameter  pistonborediameter  it increases my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
flywheelthickness increases mass ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I ve been trying to ask them about what keeps them from minimizing pistonborediameter  but I haven t gotten any response ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
though i guess it s more efficient mass than the shaft,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Mine are  but i have not made any drastic changes since  Your lowering of flywheeldiameter helped me shave off  2  more lbs,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Alright  I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design  so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
No  that does not affect it either,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I double checked the handout and yeah  it s only dependent on lower factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
How much does our weight go up if you increase pistonborediameter ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Or rather  what affects it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
even with max bearingoffset i still have factorofsafety  equals to   300 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Also lol looking back at my simulations  minimizing pistonborediameter actually increases my mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I just increased it by  2  mm and we are still slightly below our mass requirement,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i mass going to reduce flywheelthickness and see if we can minimize both,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Let me decrease my thickness a bit,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
They said they pistonborediameter broadcast it  but yeah  still  80   IDK what s going on ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
flywheel changed a value and i lost  5  lbs ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok  I decreased my weight a little bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I already got paid haha  although they said if you keep improving it we can get more even afterwars,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think we can keep going,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we should probably stop adjusting our values  we got excellent now and its going to be hard to make it any better,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I am going to try  160   The larger the offset the larger the mass and smaller factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

No  I do not need anything,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i do not,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i think you might have to increase it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Does a large Flywheel mass help you ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
No at most ill change it by  10   how much would a diameter of  50  affect your mass and factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I dont have any other dependent variables,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so im going to max piston bore diamter and well iterate from there,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
when pistonborediameter is max,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
pistonborediameter is critical to increase the weight for my simulation,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
However  I cannot do that because it s critical to the weight of piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
my mass is pretty low already  But make sure to broadcast variables,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I have a high factorofsafety for everywhere in my combination of ranges,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do I have any variables that affect your result ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do I have any variables that affect your result ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Okay update your pistonborediameter but try to keep it relatively low if possible,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Is it good to be maximized or minimized ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If I hold my variables same  the lower the diameter  the lower the Ms and factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
does a larger bore increase your factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
my factor of safety is maximized at low bearingoffset values,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
piston is about to update me with pistonborediameter  I need it to be low too  How about you,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Every  10  pistonborediameter I decrease from  70   mass decrease like  0   2 - 0   3 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
also what are your flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness values,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no it is not,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

do you need it to be higher or lower ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok lets make small changes but remember which broadcast you were at incase,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If I increase the Piston Diameter  how much will it affect your factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it was just at very good  someone changed and it went up a lot,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
although the new broadcast increased the mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing diameter decreases factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Just pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but mine is flywheel  wont get any lower,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I just need pistonborediameter which I mass working on with you and piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but the weight incresases too,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much does that effect your numbers,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
sorry  I just need pistonborediameter as well,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I can t change it from here because it will lower mass  but it will also reduce factor of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I did not,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Supposedly increasing the offset increases mass and decreases f  so lose-lose for me,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
flywheelthickness just changes the mass for me,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
higher flywheelthickness is better for me,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you try using  50  mm ?  and try to maximize the factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i know  if this were Hell s Kitchen I pistonborediameter get gordon ramsay to yell at him lol,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
and can it be lowered,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no i do not,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
No i do not ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increase factorofsafety decrease mass of the connecting rod,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i mass focusing on minimizing thickness primarily,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing it will increase the force on the connecting rod,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I am in charge of diameter and piston head thickness  Increasing diameter will increase the area  so more force  but also increase mass  Increasing head thickness will increase mass but also factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

Can you change pistonborediameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Ok  it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i mass gonna make the piston smaller to change that,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i increased the diameter to improve the factor of safety  I can reduce it if we want to try it out,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Sounds good  I ll try to decrease shaft mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Yes  I want to minimize mass but also don t want the piston head to fail,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
my part doesnt effect mass very much,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I don t think that affects my design at all but that might reduce some mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we need to work on making the design much lighter though if thats possible with your part,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

What would you like the pistonborediameter to be ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at  2   03   so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety  that would be ideal,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

Hello  can you send me the flywheeldiameter and flywheelthickness value greater than ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Yeah it keeps showing up as poor for me as well  Let me play with the piston some more  I was looking at the auto engine and didn t see how small our mass had to be,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i can also cut weight but it will reduce factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ill try to run simulation more to see if there is any other cases that has bigger f,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

alright  I can get  2   77  with that value for pistonborediameter  Do you plan on changing pistonborediameter ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
lets go back to  90  maybe ?  the quality dropped,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok the ideal design for me is pistonborediameter at  40   My mass goes down to  1   28  and factorofsafety at  17   82   Try that,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So good news  turns out the rod thickness increase from  6   5  mm to  7  mm increased the factorofsafety by  0   23  but only increased the weight by  0   13  kg,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

I agree  My part increases in weight linearly and increases in factorofsafety exponentially so its probably better to maximize it  Do you have a part that increases in factorofsafety only linearly ?  you can see it on the graphs,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
pistonborediameter isn t controlled by me,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
factorofsafety is back i increased thickness,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ill try cut a bit of weight with flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I mass gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it updates the global model,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but I can slightly increase mass to get  2   63  factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Im using the minimum possible values and cant change much more,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Kind of  increasing thickness increases factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
In my simulation I increased Tf to  51   It brought the factorofsafety down ever so slightly  but brought down the mass by  2  kg for some reason,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
any way i can help in reducing hat weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
is it possible for that to go lower,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if I increase the offset  mass increases,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
meant decrease thickness and lower the weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
not anymore  do you have control over pistonborediameter ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
seems like lower was working better,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yeah increasing pistonborediameter changes mass by an enormous amount  like change of five adds  5  to ms,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by  10  mm ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Also  does me increasing bearingoffset help you at all ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Hey if I increase pistonborediameter  will that help or hurt your design,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok so id say you worry more about low mass with pistonborediameter and I can worry more about high factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no keep it low,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I control pistonborediameter somewhere in  90 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
your part seems to be using the most mass so I pistonborediameter say worry about that rather than factorofsafety and see if the others can bump it up,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
was it pistonborediameter equals to  75  that was giving us that low weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
im just trying to max factorofsafety but your piston wont affect my flywheel,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
minimized,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Is  40  the best value you have found for pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i dont know where to reduce the weight tho,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
okay I ll keep lowering it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
hommie we need to decrease weight not increase factorofsafety  ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i can t go lower than this,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Does it kill the factorofsafety if you decrease the offset below  150  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think a lower pistonborediameter is better  something like a  75  was giving us a good weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
flywheel boi is tryna improve,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if you lower pistonborediameter I can raise the factorofsafety with flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
is it each part or globally,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i willl try decreasing dc,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Does increasing bearingoffset increase the mass or decrease,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think bearingoffset needs to be changed,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
if you get it lower than  2   0   you can try adding some mass  it s ok ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
whats the max diamter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but pistonborediameter has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
As pistonborediameter gets lower  my ms gets way to high,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
and keep pistonborediameter lower,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
not my pistonborediameter the piston s pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
What did u choose for pistonborediameter ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
thats with both at their minimum so it can t get any lower for my part,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
What did u choose for pistonborediameter ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing bearingoffset increases mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I dont have control over it  I think its you and the piston  Seems to me like the low  80  range was working best though but Im not sure,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
doe increasing pistonborediameter give you better weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
heyyis there any way you could reduce the weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
heyy is there anyway you could reduce the weight slightly ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

i can still reduce the weight somewhat,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
does increasing pistonborediameter give you better or worse weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
also reducing bearingoffset significantly reduces the factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

increasing pistonborediameter gives me a worse weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i have control over neither  only bearingoffset and dc,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length  All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I have to account for the piston diameter  higher values for that mean that I get a higher mass and factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Right now I have pistonborediameter equals to  85 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Is higher or lower pistonborediameter better for you ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Is higher or lower pistonborediameter better for you ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It looks to me like a smaller bearing offset gives both lower mass and higher factor of safety  so I mass thinking about keeping it smaller,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
higher pistonborediameter is better factorofsafety  and worse  higher  mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
a higher pistonborediameter increases the mass and factorofsafety  With  85   my mass is  13   09  and factorofsafety is  7   69 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I reduced the diameter to  40 mm to reduce the mass of the system,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
The smaller offset works well for smaller flywheel dimensions but the factorofsafety is higher overall with larger dimensions,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

we can see how good his her part is with  45  and increase if necessary,Dependencies_between_design_parameters

How does changing pistonborediameter affect your factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I ll try to bring it down,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
bearingoffset does not affect the mass  However  as you increase bearingoffset the factor of safety decreases,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It seems like larger pistonborediameter increases my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you reduce is closer to  2  while decreasing mass ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Try and decrease bearingoffset so that we increase the factor of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
cant decrease it anymore  its at  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but we can try to imporve,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

do any other parameters from other designs affect your weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can you change back to what you had before  The factorofsafety needs to increase ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If you decrease you piston diameter does it decrease mass and factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok  increasing the diameter will decrease my mass and my factory of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Increasing bearingoffset only adds weight and reduces factor of safety so I opted for the lowest one to start  Do you need it bigger greater than ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increase  sorry,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

we could try to go lower  Im still trying to figure out how this works haha,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so raising bearingoffset increases mass and reduces factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if you increase the diameter  the mass and factor of safety for my part will decrease,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I get better factorofsafety but worse mass when i maximize bearingoffset  so it problably needs to be in the middle,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I also have a second parameter that increases factorofsafety and mass if I increase that,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So we need to get min mass and max factorofsafety flywheelbut we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
My best values on both charts have bearingoffset equals to  60  in common,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

and which do you need,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
also how much does bore diameter effect you ?  If i go down to the lowest bore diameter I can increase factorofsafety a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I lowered the r values  It did lower the weight  but the factorofsafety is too low now,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
For the current bore diameter  yes  If I reduce bore diameter I can get better results,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
My bad that wasn t clear  I meant it seems like you can keep the flywheel close to that since it has a high factorofsafety to begin with,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i depennd on bearingoffset,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no i do not  i am compiling everyones,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i depend on the piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Yeah  the flywheel won t break  so i was just minimizing mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I dont think it affects much  not too sure  Lets give it a go,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
group- does anyone depend on flywheelthickness  flywheeldiameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his her mass  crankshaft is the heaviest part,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
try raising it back up a bit and see what happens,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok i increased dc and it got better ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Thats a good option,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It s getting better  keep it up,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
no only pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
to do that should I lower r  which could lower our factorofsafety too much,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yeah if it lowers factorofsafety too much  weshouldnt,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you change yours ?  Piston and flywheel just changed theres,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much does your factorofsafety increase though ?  because then we could save mass in other parts,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
 So if I decrease mass  factorofsafety will decrease by  10000   So I would not do anything,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
The piston pin is pretty important though so id say maximize mass for factorofsafety if you can,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
 anyone has lower factorofsafety change when mass dec ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
do you think lower diameter will give you a higher factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok cause I have lowest factorofsafety so ill fail first meaning overall factorofsafety depends on me,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yeah im trying to keep it on the high end,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can you reduce piston factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Its probably weighted  If we can raise the lowest factorofsafety to its max and the highest factorofsafety to its min mass it might work,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I decreases mass bu  0   04  and decreased factorofsafety by  2  due to piston changes,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if I reduce piston factorofsafety overall factorofsafety goes down a lot,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

decrease urs now,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Not with the current piston parameters  I ll see if he can change things so I can get a factorofsafety back over  3 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
wait lower your mass a bit,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Lower rather than higher works better on my end,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do you have any idea about the pistonborediameter value ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
The lowest offset possible would be ideal for the mass and factorofsafety for the crankshaft,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increasing the bore diameter will increase the factor of safety as well as increase weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
doth pistonborediameter and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So it is better to have a medium value for it then probably,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can I have a current value of pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think that works  i mass not sure how that affects the flyweel but I will change it to offset of  60  which is minimum,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Hi  looks like we should increase the factor of safety  What factor of safety do you have for the piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
No neither of thos eaffect the crankshaft,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so lower piston diamter lowers your factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok  then I think minimizing offset it fine,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Would increasing or decreasing flywheeldiameter lower the weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can we lower that ?  It might drop mass ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much does does the thickness of rod effect the factor of safety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
the smaller those two values are  the lighter the part is  but it gets weaker,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It does not affect my part,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok im going to bump mind to midrange to see how much the mass increases,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
does a larger diameter increase your mass ?  or decrease it ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Only the piston diameter pistonborediameter affects my part,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
increases it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so let s lower our weight first,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so let s lower our weight first,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so let s lower our weight first,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
does it auto update or do we have to refresh or something,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Is either flywheelthickness or flywheeldiameter a variable of other subsystems for you ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
since if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
as long as you dont dramatically decrease your factorofsafety because i think most oif it is coming from you,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if I lower my part s weight the factorofsafety will decrease largely,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
let me reduce the pistonborediameter to  40 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
The only way i can get higher factorofsafety is if piston diameter pistonborediameter is  43  is lower,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I have pistonborediameter at  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
let s just determine the weight first,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Will making the bore diameter smaller improve your factorofsafety ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
im not surprised he has a pretty big head,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
current dims  pistonborediameter equals to  40   t _ h equals to  3   25   i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so yes smaller piston diameter improves my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

If you need to increase up to  42  thats possible,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
if you increase though that increases mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It s not me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
cause i havent been changing my stuff and its fluctuating,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It just looks like the factorofsafety went down a lot,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
not that high,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Is there any way you can lower your weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you increase it to around  2  or  3 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I do not,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It was up and then it went down for some reason,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but it s better,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I MEAN INCREASE,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
but ive decided im gonna focus more on  352  bc its a heavier weighted class,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety  greater than   2  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It s all good now  Can you make your weight any lower with an factorofsafety  greater than  2   ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
neither have we,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
make it higher,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

Does a larger thickness negatively affect factorofsafety or mass ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok  I will make adjustments,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
for bearingoffset,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
As of right now  I mass comfortable around  85  for my diameter  but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok i will lessen the thickness ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
If we could lower the offset  that would optimize my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It s connecting rod Casey geez,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do you know how bearingoffset affects your factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we need to decrease it a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Yeah  I have not changed anything since my parameters were at the bounds of what I could input so I ll reach out to the other folks about it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I have bearingoffset and dc what do you control ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
yeah  i dont think i can change diameter because it will affect everyone,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok mine are bearingoffset and dc will look into those,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do you need to increase it ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we need mass down a bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I currently have it at the lowest   150  am trying to run simulation to see how it affects the output values,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
ok the lower you have it the higher my factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
What is the lower range of your weight range,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i was using the max but am running simulations for a smaller value currently,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
What is the lower limit of your weight range ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Which gives lowest weight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
weight is an output for me  The lowest weight I can get with a passable factor of safety at the current bore is  0   53 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the factorofsafety  I can make my part heavier,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I would double my system weight though ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I can try  that is the limit tho,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible  while other lighter subsystems make up for increased factorofsafety,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
that puts my mass at  2   43  and factorofsafety at  3   9  with t equals to  10   pistonborediameter equals to  25   and bearingoffset equals to  70   That s not bad for now,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
See if you can lower your mass just a little bit,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
is your design at the lowest possible weight ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Maybe  not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
See if you can bump that up,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Well you ve got the crankshaft  it should be the heaviest,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
is the factorofsafety of the design the lowest factorofsafety of any one subsystem ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I don t control that aspect it affects my value but I don t control it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
That might not be worth it then,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I Have  Since my part is probably the lightest  I increased my fs,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Just did  I think that made it heavier,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
yeah it s a lot heavier,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
does your design depend on the crankshaft ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
because it just skyrocketed,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy  Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
nice  So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Just changed it and it didn t help much,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
could we go with pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
The crankshaft takes up the most amount in terms of mass but is it possible to lower the value any further than  2   43  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
only  bearingoffset  affects my factorofsafety  Butmy factorofsafety is in the range of thousands so I don t think it matters too much ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Do you depend on any of my variables ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
mine is at the highest possible value,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
lowering flywheeldiameter helps with mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Change it back to  105  because the mass will decrease,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
thats bonkers,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No  because I haven t needed to  I mass mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

Im going to reduce piston pistonborediameter to  75 to see what happens,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I can lower my diameter more if you need it,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
and then my system depends on  3  other variables,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
and then I depend on flywheeldiameter  t _ f  and pistonborediameter,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I change it back to  80  since the overall results for  75  are not good,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Whichever gets you the highest,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
The crankshaft by far has the most mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah they say they cant decrease it any more,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think it s dependent on the flywheel  crankshaft  and connecting rod values at this point,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Can you increase your diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
No  it should still be at  40 mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Mine are flywheel thickness  flywheelthickness  and flywheel shaft diameter  flywheeldiameter ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your bore diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Oops  my thickness is  10  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
bore diameter is  40 mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What are you using as your diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Bore diameter according to the piston is  40  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
now im using diameter  equals to   55  thickness  15 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What is your piston bore diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
I don t think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from  40  to  70 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Piston diameter still  90  ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
can you broadcaset  150  ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is bearingoffset ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Ok I was at bearing support offset of  150  and crank-pin diameter of  43   8 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What is your range for diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
is your maz  105  mm ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values

What is your range for diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
 40 - 70  mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what is your flywheel shaft diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your current diameter size,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
diameter is  25  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
ok same  what is your current diameter size,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
do you need to know any flywheel variables ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
I am also not trying to change the design form here ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Are you still using  80  for your diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
thickness is  10  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Ok  so bearing offset  150  ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What is your pistonborediameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
do you need any of my variables ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston bore diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What value are you using for your piston bore diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Maybe  not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Can you change that to  85  ?  or close to it ?  That s what I have,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your crankshaft mass ?  And are you still using  70  for your crankshaft offset ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Awesome  thank you  Are you in control of that diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
piston is in charge of the diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
no only on piston bore diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Hows it looking now,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
for the diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
are you still using  40  for the diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
If you need the offset to be higher let me know ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
What can I change to help improve your design ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Do you depend on any of my variables ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
For the diameter  I think we should use  40 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Piston diameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
do you rely on a bearingoffset or a dc ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
What would you like ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
bearingoffset and pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
right  but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations ?  Do you have one ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
crankshaft bearing offset,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what s the diameter at this point ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
If the piston diameter is  75   I can get a good mix of mass and fs,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
diameter just updated back to  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
bearingoffset :  150  dc :  50 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Also  be sure to tell me if the bore diameter changes ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
so for me besides diameter  i can play around with two variables,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Diameter is  40  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
hey try changing the diameter to  90 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
do you have any variable that seems to match with those ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Did they not ask what the bore diameter was ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
let me know if you need to go any lower,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Are you still using  70  for the offset ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Ok  I ll ask them if so and then we can go from there  That looks like a hard simulation to run ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
 12  for flywheelthickness and  60  for flywheeldiameter,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
It others peoples dimensions so im trying to figure that out,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Can you change flywheeldiameter to  55  and braodcast,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Maybe ask to change the bore diameter and then go from there ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
do you have any variable that seems to relate to them ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what is your bore diameter now ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Still  40 mm  Will increasing bore help your design ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Diameter  equals to   40  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Diameter  equals to   40 mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
adjust which part ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Do u depend on the bore diameter ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
what about thickness of flywheel ? ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
we have excellent quality right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you broadcasted your most recent design ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we have excellent quality right now,Monitoring_objective_values
looks like we re done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok our current broadcast is  excellent  so are we done here ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  my most recent design is what is broadcasted,Monitoring_objective_values
It looks like our engine design is excellent then  And yes that works with my design requirements,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass still seeing  poor  on my end,Monitoring_objective_values
oh wait no,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah uhhh that looks good  nice ,Monitoring_objective_values
lol great,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t broadcasted yet ho,Monitoring_objective_values
ta said we re good,Monitoring_objective_values

I am getting around  2   26 - 2   95 ,Monitoring_objective_values
do we just sit here now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright,Monitoring_objective_values
do we just sit here now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah it does but all of the factorofsafety have been over  2  except one of them,Monitoring_objective_values
it looks like someone changed the mass to be wrong but yea,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you messaged the others about this yet ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I noticed the same thing,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your mass and factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah exactly,Monitoring_objective_values
broadcast that,Monitoring_objective_values
idk they haven t been super responsive,Monitoring_objective_values

from when it was at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
I think were at safe right now,Monitoring_objective_values
me either,Monitoring_objective_values
wonderful system  this is ,Monitoring_objective_values
your individual mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we went from excellent to poor  rip,Monitoring_objective_values
I have not changed any of my values since we were at excellent quality,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  leave yours in a safe config,Monitoring_objective_values
My individual mass is  1   27 ,Monitoring_objective_values
have you been changing anything from when it was at excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

yep  just give me a sec,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
cool,Monitoring_objective_values
alright ,Monitoring_objective_values
Nice ,Monitoring_objective_values
no i only see those  4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
That should be good,Monitoring_objective_values
What weight are you at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
no I do not think it does  I was able to get my factorofsafety up above  3   4  though,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
definitely,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   47 ,Monitoring_objective_values
idk how but our mass earlier was  33   29  or something,Monitoring_objective_values
with a factorofsafety of  2   31 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are back to very good now too,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  that was nice,Monitoring_objective_values
global is at  2   3  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
ya  should chat about that,Monitoring_objective_values
alright  guess not then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alright  guess no then,Monitoring_objective_values
but you can t change that right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t changed a thing since we were at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
good idea,Monitoring_objective_values
just did    03 kg,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
thank you ,Monitoring_objective_values
completely,Monitoring_objective_values
Im at  0   1  rn with a factorofsafety of  2   52 ,Monitoring_objective_values
still factorofsafety of over  1000 ,Monitoring_objective_values
based on the little chart they gave us our design should be at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Because everyone else is min mass,Monitoring_objective_values
true ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah that is what i am thinking as well,Monitoring_objective_values
we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are currently at very good  are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

wait what,Monitoring_objective_values
pistons mass is  0   52  with a factorofsafety of  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I can ask but I mass worried not everyone s was updated,Monitoring_objective_values
I still see the total mass of  2   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine are actually better than when it was excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
I see  2   73 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah nope,Monitoring_objective_values
well  update your broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Monitoring_objective_values
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Monitoring_objective_values
someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to  3   25 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Can we try to increase factorofsafety beyond  2   01  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome  have you noticed that based on the chart we should be in excellent with our current values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
as long as your factorofsafety  greater than   2  it doesnt matter,Monitoring_objective_values

Way to be on top of things  I won t vote you off the island,Monitoring_objective_values
what values work best for you,Monitoring_objective_values
lol,Monitoring_objective_values
I updated,Monitoring_objective_values
rightt,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah Im doing that after every sim  we re already in the very good range,Monitoring_objective_values
mine shows poor range  Is this same for you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

Whats your mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Let me know what you decide,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  I was looking at the factor of safety and realized that with the head so small  the factorofsafety wasn t gonna go up,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
My simulation would be excellent  the broadcast was very good and now poor ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok keep those for now,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor,Monitoring_objective_values
i havnt changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
mass is  0   54  and factorofsafety is  3286 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes do that,Monitoring_objective_values
I havnt changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
I had an excellent quality  but with someone s new broadcast  it s not poor,Monitoring_objective_values
now ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you know where our low factorofsafety is coming from ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yo  what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is  2   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
We were at excellent and now poor  did you change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
our factor of safety went down,Monitoring_objective_values

mass :  2   12  factorofsafety :   7   02  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
We were at exceelent and now poor  did you change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ms is just below  2   factorofsafety is around  20 ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you have an input i should try ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We once had an excellent quality though,Monitoring_objective_values
only need a factorofsafety of  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our factorofsafety was at like  2   5  and mass was at  44   Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton ,Monitoring_objective_values
What values do you need ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
someone is messing this up  are values are getting very bad,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah thats ok the factorofsafety for othee s will be less,Monitoring_objective_values
ok I have mass :   3   05   factorofsafety  2   02 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 3286  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Must be,Monitoring_objective_values
also broadcast those  I am not using your variables others might,Monitoring_objective_values
He wont respond lol,Monitoring_objective_values
 4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
it was excelent  someone messed it up,Monitoring_objective_values
thats what they were at when we had excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
ok ill see,Monitoring_objective_values
i have mass  1   27   factorofsafety :   15886 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Cause the factorofsafety only goes up by like   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Great,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  mass is still high though,Monitoring_objective_values
otherwise my factorofsafety is below  1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
no my mass is  3   05  and my factorofsafety is  2   02 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is good  Mass is  10 kg too high,Monitoring_objective_values
The factorofsafety is  2   03   so there are no improvements available,Monitoring_objective_values
so my guess is that if you re higher than  2  you re good,Monitoring_objective_values
how ?  are you broadcasting it ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 ,Monitoring_objective_values
wow ok,Monitoring_objective_values
My sim shows mass equals to  29   24   f equals to  2   83 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your values currently at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
someones factorofsafety is too low,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your values currently at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
flywheel says they have an factorofsafety of  3286  apparently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your values currently at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
now we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
now VERY GOOd  we should sit here,Monitoring_objective_values
now we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety decrease like  2 - 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :   Very Good  is fine with me,Monitoring_objective_values
you mean the global variables ?  the factorofsafety is  0   57  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   83 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok don t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
no we should go for excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Will experiment,Monitoring_objective_values
howeffect on mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok don t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
ok don t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
ok don t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
Was  12  and  40  still your used numbers ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
for your ouputs only ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed  we can still try to look for improvements,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  ok with results,Monitoring_objective_values
How big of a difference between  45  and  48  is there for your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  ok with results,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  ok with results,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  ok with results,Monitoring_objective_values
very big,Monitoring_objective_values
who got very good and broadcast those values,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah we are now at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
My outputs  Global is  34   35  and  0   81 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What could i do to help your factorofsafety go up ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
who got very good and broadcast those values,Monitoring_objective_values
who got very good and broadcast those values,Monitoring_objective_values
who got very good and broadcast those values,Monitoring_objective_values
based on the handout we should be at  excellent  idk why it doesn t say that,Monitoring_objective_values
what about the factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
No i think its fine i was just curious,Monitoring_objective_values
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Monitoring_objective_values
does yours show exccelent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass is  2   5   factorofsafety is  0   57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
values are at a minimum for me,Monitoring_objective_values
crankshaft guy has factorofsafety of  0   57  we should see what he needs ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
yes save those values and we can try to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
that is for everyone  are you broadcasting your variables so that they are accounted for in the total global factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
you need to change your current broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
our mass is too high rn,Monitoring_objective_values
I thought that the factorofsafety on top is our total global factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Recheck your broadcast  it just went to poor,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
the mass shot up,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea I just asked him,Monitoring_objective_values
ok with the results,Monitoring_objective_values
do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
man  0   09  factorofsafety lol,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your values now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah I haven t changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
is your factorofsafety  0   09  now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same,Monitoring_objective_values
your specific results will be in the table under the charts,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back,Monitoring_objective_values
I think someone s trying to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get very good simulation ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back,Monitoring_objective_values
 To all  :  What ever change was just made  we should put it back,Monitoring_objective_values
what is yours ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get very good simulation ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get very good simulation ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
haven t changed anything on my end  that s weird,Monitoring_objective_values
Is anybody out there ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah for a bit ,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass :   1   75  factorofsafety :  6   07 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I havent updated anything,Monitoring_objective_values
Same,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass getting poor right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Will keep you updated,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
You ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
wait,Monitoring_objective_values
haven t changed anything on my ene,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  0   09  isnt hot,Monitoring_objective_values
end ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you broadcasting new values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
sorry,Monitoring_objective_values
You ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you broadcasting new values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you make that change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea  just a slight chance to fail,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
are you broadcasting new values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good,Monitoring_objective_values
It showed very good and I haven t changed anything since then ,Monitoring_objective_values
im pretty sure a factor of safety less than  1  is a guaranteed fail,Monitoring_objective_values
yea,Monitoring_objective_values
ok run again with values when you were getting good,Monitoring_objective_values
and your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet  ill update my factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
No  My values have been the same since about  9  :  45  ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety went from  3   18  to  2   95  and mass from  0   13  to  0   11 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass,Monitoring_objective_values
 27   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
he won t respond to me,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass is as low as possible  We cant all have the minimum mass,Monitoring_objective_values

Anything changing when you change your numbers now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 27   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 11   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I just followed up with him,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  :  ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety went up,Monitoring_objective_values
Anything you need from me yet,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you change your broadcast by anychance ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Has the crankshaft got back to you about their factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass at ?  and can it be lowered,Monitoring_objective_values
wait can you explain again,Monitoring_objective_values
Sweet  by how much ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
me either,Monitoring_objective_values
can you try broadcasting it since we are over  12  kg,Monitoring_objective_values
okay we have very good again,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass at ?  and can it be lowered,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey  have you broadcasted your values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
wait now we re very good,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is too high,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is too high,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is too high,Monitoring_objective_values
it s very good right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass is at a min  factorofsafety is still about  4700 ,Monitoring_objective_values

I am doing that now  Thanks for the help ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
Im using   8  and   55  for r 2  and r 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
thats the most central point in my simulation,Monitoring_objective_values
Definitely ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok one sec,Monitoring_objective_values
can you try making it a bit bigger ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass not sure how this works tbh haha,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
is this scooter,Monitoring_objective_values
It just updated,Monitoring_objective_values
i see poor ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
it just said very good,Monitoring_objective_values
Where do you even see that ?  My global quality shows poor,Monitoring_objective_values
did you just increase your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you just increase your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
it said very good but someone changed someting,Monitoring_objective_values
more mass,Monitoring_objective_values
For sure ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is showing as poor right now,Monitoring_objective_values
is your objectives different ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Got it,Monitoring_objective_values
i saw a very good for a second but its gone now,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t touched anything for a while,Monitoring_objective_values
ok ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much does the mass of your part very  like the min vs max  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I put mine to initial values and the factorofsafety is good now,Monitoring_objective_values
Lost a great deal on factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   31  to  25   99 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What factors are you interested in ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
that s okay  factorofsafety is still close to  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What factors are you interested in ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values

rn my mass is  6   5  and factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
im trying to figure out who has the min factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is  2   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is also  2   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what variables are you considering ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety ?  mine is  2   09   piston is  2   09  as well,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety ?  mine is  2   09   piston is  2   09  as well,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  2   7  factorofsafety and  57  mass,Monitoring_objective_values
 same,Monitoring_objective_values
frick my mass is  57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats the lightest you can go with fs  greater than   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay I don t need either of those in my analysis,Monitoring_objective_values
try that,Monitoring_objective_values
I have t 1   L  and r,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
im talking about your indidivudal part,Monitoring_objective_values
Isn t a factor of safety of  2  considered outstanding  most of mine are in the hundreds ,Monitoring_objective_values
the closest factorofsafety I have above  2  is  3   78   I ll try broadcasting it,Monitoring_objective_values
minimum mass that has factorofsafety  greater than   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
My factorofsafety is around  2   Some parts may just have different ranges,Monitoring_objective_values
I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs  greater than   2  design ,Monitoring_objective_values
My design includes r 2  and r 3   do those affect yours at all ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My design includes r 2  and r 3   do those affect yours at all ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

yeah thats what i did,Monitoring_objective_values
and what ive been telling the others hahah,Monitoring_objective_values
got it,Monitoring_objective_values
Ye i think so  mine for just my part is  3   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
interesting,Monitoring_objective_values
Do all of us just ahve a control with a mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
message back when you did it,Monitoring_objective_values
message back when you did it,Monitoring_objective_values
message back when you did it,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  that s the goal,Monitoring_objective_values
Im on mine rn with  0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what values are you at,Monitoring_objective_values
message back when you did it,Monitoring_objective_values
my part mass is  6   5  and my factorofsafety is  2   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my factors of safety are around  0   5 - 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
just barely above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
What are your design variables ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your design variables ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my foss is  12708   83  which makes no sense to me,Monitoring_objective_values
yes both do,Monitoring_objective_values
are your masses high,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your design variables ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
that cant be right,Monitoring_objective_values
exactly,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey did you see message from flywheel ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  that was what I was thinking,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah thats weird,Monitoring_objective_values
whats the mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your fs,Monitoring_objective_values
I ll prioritize on increasing factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
ok let me know if you want to change something,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
please do,Monitoring_objective_values
how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ranges,Monitoring_objective_values
Mine range from  1   5  to  65  ,Monitoring_objective_values
fllywheel says their mass is  12708  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yep just did it,Monitoring_objective_values
sorry their factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey  how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ?  Ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
they responded,Monitoring_objective_values
cool,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I think that is a good idea,Monitoring_objective_values
okay cool everyone responded,Monitoring_objective_values
okay cool everyone responded,Monitoring_objective_values
okay cool everyone responded,Monitoring_objective_values
okay cool everyone responded,Monitoring_objective_values
terrible,Monitoring_objective_values
are we all selected ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are we all selected ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are we all selected ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are we all selected ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
so increase factorofsafety for one component now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
right now my mass is at   69  and my factorofsafety is  3   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Her  how are your masses and factorofsafety looking ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are those variables L and r ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  1   12  which is the lowest value  and my factorofsafety is  legit   4706   97 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  i think so,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1  to  3   24  for mass   1   72  to  54   23  for factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
or else the factorofsafety is very low,Monitoring_objective_values
for both factorofsafety and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
great,Monitoring_objective_values
hahaha,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah that sounds like a good plan,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay  how about you try to increase your factorofsafety  prioritize that,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
masses go from around  1  to  4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety like   5  to  4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my masses are very small  and factorofsafety are  0   4 - 3   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how,Monitoring_objective_values
I think the  82   5  is the best  let me know when you are okay for me to change it back ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok great,Monitoring_objective_values
reply when done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
reply when done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

do you have the  1   65  factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you have the  1   65  factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I know its weird,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what you had bc we were at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
oh nvm,Monitoring_objective_values
great question  but it is all legitimate,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what you had bc we were at good,Monitoring_objective_values
yall stay at where you are,Monitoring_objective_values
my part is a lot of the total weight,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what you had bc we were at good,Monitoring_objective_values
Alright ,Monitoring_objective_values
how about for factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what you had we were at good,Monitoring_objective_values
my masss is  6   28 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i havent changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is  2   85 ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh okay  sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  mass minimization is quite useless on my end  as my values are  0   02  -  0   12 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay wait,Monitoring_objective_values
DONT CHANGE,Monitoring_objective_values
wait,Monitoring_objective_values
DONT CHANGE,Monitoring_objective_values

Okay  I think I have control of L and r ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good right now,Monitoring_objective_values
i dont want to mess it up,Monitoring_objective_values
ya the factorofsafety is so bad,Monitoring_objective_values
ayyyyyy,Monitoring_objective_values
nvm looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is bad,Monitoring_objective_values
as their ranges are also pretty small,Monitoring_objective_values
why isnt this excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What levels of mass are you dealing with ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i have the same questionb,Monitoring_objective_values
We are hitting our requirements,Monitoring_objective_values
yo we got excellent,Monitoring_objective_values

we are at excellent now,Monitoring_objective_values
what do you mean by ms,Monitoring_objective_values
so are we just done then ?  lol,Monitoring_objective_values
right now its  0   1  but it ranges from  0   01  to  0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass ?  sorry  i am between  0   5  and  0   6 ,Monitoring_objective_values
just  0   12 ,Monitoring_objective_values
excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
I think we are done,Monitoring_objective_values
I will try that,Monitoring_objective_values
I think we are good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
record your current value,Monitoring_objective_values
I think we are done,Monitoring_objective_values
I think we are good if we get excellent maybe ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is currently  1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values

ill ask,Monitoring_objective_values
how,Monitoring_objective_values
you got it,Monitoring_objective_values
we got it ,Monitoring_objective_values
just wait it out,Monitoring_objective_values
No  looks like that L and r are different than mine ,Monitoring_objective_values
we got it ,Monitoring_objective_values
we got it ,Monitoring_objective_values

No I didn t,Monitoring_objective_values
wait we re at very good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok so  2   96  is actually Good  we need to improve factorofsafety to get it to Good,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What just changed ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What just changed ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
did you just change something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the mass went up,Monitoring_objective_values
what is going on,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
ok  whats the plan stan ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change something after excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
i asked,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
we were at excellent but now its very good,Monitoring_objective_values
how did the mass go up,Monitoring_objective_values
ive been at the first broadcast for a while now,Monitoring_objective_values
how did the mass go up,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
just did,Monitoring_objective_values
whos changing things,Monitoring_objective_values
My factorofsafety went down I think ,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing things,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing things rn,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes,Monitoring_objective_values
go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes,Monitoring_objective_values
okay well we were at excellent and the other guys swear they didn t change anything lol,Monitoring_objective_values
nah,Monitoring_objective_values
im not changing anything ,Monitoring_objective_values
got it,Monitoring_objective_values
really ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t touched anything,Monitoring_objective_values
they said they ddnt,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  that s odd,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  that s odd,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  that s odd,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  that s odd,Monitoring_objective_values
try to increase your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
why,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   85 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   91 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
This is strange,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah we just need mass to go down,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah its fine i jsut want   17 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is over  4000 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  1   12 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
We need factorofsafety to increase now,Monitoring_objective_values
what do you mean its   51 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Global requirements top of page,Monitoring_objective_values
It was good for a second  what happened,Monitoring_objective_values
try not to change anything until you talk to someone,Monitoring_objective_values
have you heard anything from crankshaft ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
try not to change anything until you talk to someone,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  they are active,Monitoring_objective_values
the one i mass at now is the best one there is on the list,Monitoring_objective_values
Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
so it looks like my max factorofsafety is  1   23  with  47 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
what happended to our factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Someone picked an factorofsafety of  0   51 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what happended to our factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
what happended to our factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what happended to our factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
no ive checked,Monitoring_objective_values
who moved we are at poor now,Monitoring_objective_values
man what happened,Monitoring_objective_values
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
im so confused what happened,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   62 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
it doesnt matter if youre not the min factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
nah dont do that,Monitoring_objective_values
says very good still,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
by about   7  or  1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass trying to find out what everyone s factorofsafety is  crankshafter has theirs at  3   62 ,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
I am staying at mass  0   07  and fs  1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
update back to very good,Monitoring_objective_values
what really ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
We need an factorofsafety of  1   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
got it,Monitoring_objective_values
you there,Monitoring_objective_values
 2  is for expecially good design,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
my highest factorofsafety is  1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
they just not responding to messages ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay mine is  3   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
the values range as other engineers alter their broadcasted values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
how do i checkt that,Monitoring_objective_values
can you go higher now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   14 ,Monitoring_objective_values
nevermind I mass being stupid,Monitoring_objective_values
on your list ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you there,Monitoring_objective_values
bad ok dont do that,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah ,Monitoring_objective_values
Is your factorofsafety really low ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
bueno,Monitoring_objective_values
we reached good,Monitoring_objective_values
yep raised it,Monitoring_objective_values
but yes  we need to keep track of where we are,Monitoring_objective_values
we reached good,Monitoring_objective_values
GOOD,Monitoring_objective_values
WE are GOOD,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  3   27  kg and  1   23  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
We are GOOD,Monitoring_objective_values
GOOD ,Monitoring_objective_values
With  0   12  mass ,Monitoring_objective_values
GOOD ,Monitoring_objective_values
GOOD,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
our mass is the only thing to change now,Monitoring_objective_values
you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nobody touch anything haha,Monitoring_objective_values
ok dont do that,Monitoring_objective_values
so i dont want to change,Monitoring_objective_values
nobody touch anything haha,Monitoring_objective_values
I have  3   03  with mass of  0   12  ,Monitoring_objective_values
nobody touch anything haha,Monitoring_objective_values
cool  not touching anything,Monitoring_objective_values
nobody touch anything haha,Monitoring_objective_values
oh dang,Monitoring_objective_values
No we re not good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
cool  not touching anything,Monitoring_objective_values
cool  not touching anything,Monitoring_objective_values
if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an factorofsafety of over  2  that chould do it,Monitoring_objective_values
I have factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  with mass  equals to   0   12  ,Monitoring_objective_values
HEllo,Monitoring_objective_values
cool  not touching anything,Monitoring_objective_values
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
im at  2   72 kg and  2   28  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i agree haha,Monitoring_objective_values
so youre at the value that is closest to  2  factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
so nevermind haha,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   06  right,Monitoring_objective_values
or maybe two or three are tied,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah that s what im trying to find out,Monitoring_objective_values
my individual factorofsafety is in the range of  2000   not sure how to compare that to  2 factorofsafety on a system wide level,Monitoring_objective_values
but we have a good design,Monitoring_objective_values
sorry I was distracted by other teammates ,Monitoring_objective_values
all good,Monitoring_objective_values
my time is up,Monitoring_objective_values
my time is up,Monitoring_objective_values

What are you working on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we gotta talk,Monitoring_objective_values
What about you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me  can you try and get them to talk to me  :   I need to discuss values with them,Monitoring_objective_values
sure,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah the pin is pretty light  shouldnt be an issue,Monitoring_objective_values
what are you working on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
we are  1   94  over mass rn,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values

The highest performance is at  3   91  factorofsafety and  5   2 mass,Monitoring_objective_values
hi  what are you working on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  what parameters are you designing for ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
updated my mass to  1   19 ,Monitoring_objective_values
updated my mass to  1   19 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we at very good rn im happy with that,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe ?  what is yours,Monitoring_objective_values
we at very good rn im happy with that,Monitoring_objective_values
Trying to figure out what s happening,Monitoring_objective_values
we at very good rn im happy with that,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   1   19 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we at very good rn im happy with that,Monitoring_objective_values
You ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

bro are you alive,Monitoring_objective_values
helloooo,Monitoring_objective_values
ok just making sure it updates,Monitoring_objective_values
yea my bad  I ve got  7   15 kg right now,Monitoring_objective_values
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
You ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

I haven t changed anything yet,Monitoring_objective_values
my bad  thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
let me know if you need anything from me,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   31 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I didn t change,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any info from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any info from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current analysis ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Maybe ask around,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any info from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok will do,Monitoring_objective_values
what variables affect you,Monitoring_objective_values
 18   63 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok guys looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok guys looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok guys looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok guys looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
What about you,Monitoring_objective_values
we got it,Monitoring_objective_values
ok thats not me then  maybe ask around,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
we re at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
someone touched it,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome,Monitoring_objective_values
yuppppp,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
or we were for a second,Monitoring_objective_values
and a tH of  10   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
i mass having the best value now,Monitoring_objective_values
alright we re at very good  I say lets leave it at this,Monitoring_objective_values
ayyy the status is good somehow,Monitoring_objective_values
we just had excellent but someone touched it,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
we got excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
same here,Monitoring_objective_values
Actually its better now,Monitoring_objective_values
we got excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
we got excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
the mass of the piston is currently  2   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we got excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay I ll let you know what I get,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
we finished now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet we re at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
we finished now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we finished now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Its excellent now,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
yea we re at excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
cool we should be good then,Monitoring_objective_values
Sweet we re at excellent quality rn,Monitoring_objective_values
cool,Monitoring_objective_values
so hows life,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  mine is only   5   Idk how factorofsafety works but mine goes above  5 k,Monitoring_objective_values
perfect  thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
lmk what you think,Monitoring_objective_values
lmk what you think,Monitoring_objective_values
lmk what you think,Monitoring_objective_values
great  done then,Monitoring_objective_values
so hows life,Monitoring_objective_values
great  done then,Monitoring_objective_values
Thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
great  done then,Monitoring_objective_values
so hows life,Monitoring_objective_values
Thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
no problem,Monitoring_objective_values
We can make that happen,Monitoring_objective_values
I think were good  We are at the highest point we can be  Good job ,Monitoring_objective_values
haha good can t wait to go work on this lab,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome  go team,Monitoring_objective_values
gotta love it,Monitoring_objective_values
cool,Monitoring_objective_values
i havent really started yet,Monitoring_objective_values
thats fine we already have the highest rating with an acceptable factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
i could change so that it have factorofsafety of  2  but weights  2  kg lighter,Monitoring_objective_values
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
check with the others,Monitoring_objective_values
for my component,Monitoring_objective_values
yup  will do  ;  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i haven t updated,Monitoring_objective_values
pretty good  how about yourself,Monitoring_objective_values
How s the design going ?  I think we got to an excellent rating already ,Monitoring_objective_values
wait ,Monitoring_objective_values
How s the design going ?  I think we got to an excellent rating already ,Monitoring_objective_values
i updated,Monitoring_objective_values
i updated my design,Monitoring_objective_values
What range of masses can you use ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok so your mass should be fine  not a big contributing factor,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change the mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass shot up  we back to very good did you change,Monitoring_objective_values
Someone just changed something,Monitoring_objective_values
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I have mass at  0   14  and factorofsafety at  2   6  currently for my component  what are you looking at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i didnt change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
mass shot up  we back to very good did you change,Monitoring_objective_values
mass shot up  we back to very good did you change,Monitoring_objective_values
did any mass values change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did any mass values change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did any mass values change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
let me change around and see what i got,Monitoring_objective_values
woah were at poor now,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass on  0   69  now with a factorofsafety of  3   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
now poor,Monitoring_objective_values
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
the factorofsafety is quit low,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I won t,Monitoring_objective_values
agree,Monitoring_objective_values
Is there anything I can do to help you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing stuff ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok good  I would just assume your part has the most mass,Monitoring_objective_values
it s poor again lol,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass using  47   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
rn is very,Monitoring_objective_values
very good,Monitoring_objective_values
right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah we were at excellent but we ve gone back down to poor now somehow,Monitoring_objective_values
Someone changed something,Monitoring_objective_values
we had excelent at one point,Monitoring_objective_values
i updated another design,Monitoring_objective_values
im at what ive always been at,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass range is around  0   02  to   12 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you at that value again,Monitoring_objective_values
im at what ive always been at,Monitoring_objective_values
 47   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
im at what ive always been at,Monitoring_objective_values
Is there anything I can do to help you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
great,Monitoring_objective_values
we had  good  at one point didnt we ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we had  good  at one point didnt we ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we had  good  at one point didnt we ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah same,Monitoring_objective_values
what ranges of mass do you have for your part ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we had  good  at one point didnt we ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok i ll ask around,Monitoring_objective_values
We did,Monitoring_objective_values
yea we need to figure out whos value changed,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah same here,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
hello ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
yea we need to figure out whos value changed,Monitoring_objective_values
ok mine is like   5 - 1  so im trying to change factorofsafety more,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  is he working on fixing it ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Nope must be the other two that need that,Monitoring_objective_values
someone changed it again,Monitoring_objective_values
someone changed it again,Monitoring_objective_values
someone changed it again,Monitoring_objective_values
my bad lol the range of mass is like  0     0   1  ish,Monitoring_objective_values
someone changed it again,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you changing youre values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you changing youre values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 your,Monitoring_objective_values
 your,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Monitoring_objective_values
someone is changing stuff,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your values now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you changing stuff ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  5   2  and factorofsafety is  3   91 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I didnt change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Monitoring_objective_values
at that  I can get mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   03  which are good values,Monitoring_objective_values
whats the range of mass you have ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
no I am just refreshing,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at very good again as of  12  ;  53 ,Monitoring_objective_values
That s where it was when we got the result as good,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay we are good now,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
nah,Monitoring_objective_values
can we make it better ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
got em,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay we are at,Monitoring_objective_values
this is as good as i can get i think,Monitoring_objective_values
 Good ,Monitoring_objective_values
i see that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok yeah so really small  I was just wondering why mass was so high,Monitoring_objective_values
this is as good as i can get,Monitoring_objective_values
Who changed it,Monitoring_objective_values
any updates ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay let s keep it at that then,Monitoring_objective_values
Who changed it,Monitoring_objective_values
try making your factorofsafety high because i think that is really hurting the oveerall factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you chnaging anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
you should probably ask him her,Monitoring_objective_values
 47   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
no we need mass below  35 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok cool  Do you need any values from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Monitoring_objective_values
or is there anything else you control,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
ok if its the same as what we had at excellent then it should be fine but it isnt,Monitoring_objective_values
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Monitoring_objective_values
Remember the simulation you have selected right now in case we need to go back,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your weight and factorofsafety values,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
we are at  Good  now,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  any luck getting it back to excellent ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your weight and factorofsafety values,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your weight and factorofsafety values,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your weight and factorofsafety values,Monitoring_objective_values
hey what are your values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 18   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Monitoring_objective_values
I am simply sitting here,Monitoring_objective_values
ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change,Monitoring_objective_values
where are you getting that info,Monitoring_objective_values
Who changed it,Monitoring_objective_values
Who changed it,Monitoring_objective_values
I think you and I have the most influence over total mass  What is your current mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the highest factorofsafety rn for me is  0   89 ,Monitoring_objective_values
that wasnt me,Monitoring_objective_values
that wasnt me,Monitoring_objective_values
 37   46  and  2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
that wasnt me,Monitoring_objective_values
that wasnt me,Monitoring_objective_values
ok i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my second option is mass  equals to   20   55  and factorofsafety  equals to   2   83 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I cant get a response tho,Monitoring_objective_values
Talking with crankshaft since we need to coordinate on mass,Monitoring_objective_values
 37   49  kg and  2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
damn,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  1   83  and factorofsafety  1   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our mass keeps going up,Monitoring_objective_values
i have the factorofsafety at  2   85  and mass as  6   26 ,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
the plot on the white board,Monitoring_objective_values
 4   42  and  10   19 ,Monitoring_objective_values
probably,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i meant for your individual part,Monitoring_objective_values
i meant for your part,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety greater than  2  and mass lesser than  35 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Is there any information I could give you that could help your design ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ill try,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
gives excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
the mass from my part is pretty small but i can get factorofsafety to like  0   89 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh I see,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I don t know how ,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass  5   2  factorofsafety  3   91 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
 47   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh there we go,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you change something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok we re doing well  We re at good s,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i see that,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your current value ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah for sure him,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is the high bit,Monitoring_objective_values
very close now,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is the high bit,Monitoring_objective_values
our weight is the high bit,Monitoring_objective_values
getting close,Monitoring_objective_values
hello ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Hold where you are,Monitoring_objective_values
I think you re right,Monitoring_objective_values
Hold where you are,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
We are going back up ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok we re close,Monitoring_objective_values
ok we re close,Monitoring_objective_values
okay can di,Monitoring_objective_values
cool thats good,Monitoring_objective_values
ok we re close,Monitoring_objective_values
do ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok we re close,Monitoring_objective_values
I have the best broadcast available for my thing,Monitoring_objective_values
TRUE,Monitoring_objective_values
while keeping the factorofsafety fixed,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
heloooo,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
What is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we just had excellent for a bit so I was trying to see what we could better,Monitoring_objective_values
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
current mass is  0   01  with factorofsafety  0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I have my best broadcast for the available thing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need me to change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   26  and  2   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
at  62   5  the mass goes up from  1   89  to  2   94 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I changed factorofsafety but not the diamter,Monitoring_objective_values
now we are at poor again ,Monitoring_objective_values
try talk with other designer and see if they need anything,Monitoring_objective_values
for my part or the whole thing ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are the values you put,Monitoring_objective_values
very bad change,Monitoring_objective_values
same here,Monitoring_objective_values
same same,Monitoring_objective_values
your part,Monitoring_objective_values
communication is key my brotha,Monitoring_objective_values
was that you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i just sent that to everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
I ve just been clicking refresh for the last  20  minutes haha,Monitoring_objective_values
i guess it s the system messing with us lol,Monitoring_objective_values
So your mass is the largest contributor by far  can we reduce that at all ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
was that you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
we had excellent until someone changed it,Monitoring_objective_values
same and im currently there,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t changed in  5  mins,Monitoring_objective_values
what mass are you working with ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the new design looks real good,Monitoring_objective_values
shoot,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   31 ,Monitoring_objective_values
so close,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
the new design looks real good,Monitoring_objective_values
its the smallest I can go,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
but no one changed anything i believe,Monitoring_objective_values
nope dont thing so,Monitoring_objective_values
I think both of us are good,Monitoring_objective_values
i have mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety at  1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you just change something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you just change something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you just change something greater than ,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
no i don t need that,Monitoring_objective_values
Hi how is it going ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   07  and factorofsafety  equals to   1   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your settings now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
this is what i ahve rn,Monitoring_objective_values
lol sorry for the repeat,Monitoring_objective_values
that is the best I can get,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass asking around,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   27 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   36 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i mass asking around rn,Monitoring_objective_values
ok cool,Monitoring_objective_values
same here,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you have a factor of safety above  2   06  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
Keep your factorofsafety above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh ok  Because we went back to poor,Monitoring_objective_values
Keep your factorofsafety above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
sitting at  2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh ok  Because we went back to poor,Monitoring_objective_values
whoever changed it change back,Monitoring_objective_values
whoever changed it change back,Monitoring_objective_values
whoever changed it change back,Monitoring_objective_values
whoever changed it change back,Monitoring_objective_values
ok my mass is   53  and factorofsafety is  1929 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is too low now,Monitoring_objective_values
thats good,Monitoring_objective_values
I didn t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
getting close,Monitoring_objective_values
pretty close now actually,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
cool we are good,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety s  is  9193   31 ,Monitoring_objective_values
only   7  away now,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
try increasing your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
who went down in weight ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   91 factorofsafety  5   2 mass,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
 5   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
only   7  away from excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok yeah thats not you,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i have factorofsafety at  3   23 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I didn t change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
were at good lets leave it,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  3   13   the lowest option  and factorofsafety is  0   58 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do we want to end with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay,Monitoring_objective_values
Do we want to end with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do we want to end with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do we want to end with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you ending the experiment,Monitoring_objective_values
are we content with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are we content with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   12  with f at  3   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
are we content with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i cant change anything  We done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are we content with very good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
sure,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i cant change anything  We done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Im fine with it,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i cant change anything  We done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i cant change anything  We done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the highest factorofsafety you can get ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I think that s the best we can get,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   75  and  6   07 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass fine with that,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
can you vut the mass by any chance ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We are good now,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  1   97  factorofsafety  3   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you good with the results ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
im good,Monitoring_objective_values
agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
so close,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass good too,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe we should just call it good,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass ending it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alright,Monitoring_objective_values
i guess it s good,Monitoring_objective_values
good work,Monitoring_objective_values
good work,Monitoring_objective_values
good work,Monitoring_objective_values
good work,Monitoring_objective_values
were good,Monitoring_objective_values
good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
let s get this bread,Monitoring_objective_values
 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Try  15 ,Monitoring_objective_values
aight bet,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey  what factorofsafety  do you think would be good enough   1   5 - 2   25  ish ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
waaaaait my bad,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
More than  2  is excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
George ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
yuh,Monitoring_objective_values
what about now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
with a ratio of  4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey whats the factorofsafety for your subsystem ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
bet,Monitoring_objective_values
has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 9   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
nah,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Nvm I can see them,Monitoring_objective_values
It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I mass doing something wrong,Monitoring_objective_values
For the one I just ran I got  2   62 ,Monitoring_objective_values
huh I would ask a TA then ,Monitoring_objective_values
aight did you broadcast anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the other values on our team are like between  2   5  and  5000 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What info do you have ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah we are less than  3  but the factorofsafety is still   59   yikes,Monitoring_objective_values
Quality very good Nice ,Monitoring_objective_values
Quality very good Nice ,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
Quality very good Nice ,Monitoring_objective_values
is that your ideal dim ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
quality looks very good so idk ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I got factorofsafety  2  WITH  1   67  ms,Monitoring_objective_values
I made a design change to cut weight by   7  with similar factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Global quality looking bad though,Monitoring_objective_values
we almost there,Monitoring_objective_values
negative,Monitoring_objective_values
What were the values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh okay  Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team,Monitoring_objective_values
I mean factorofsafety only needs to be greater than  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
i will see what i can do,Monitoring_objective_values
Perfect,Monitoring_objective_values
We need to increase factorofsafety somehow,Monitoring_objective_values
Any luck ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
hey  just wondering  what are your inputs ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your mass and factorofsafety values looking like now greater than ,Monitoring_objective_values
Cool,Monitoring_objective_values
mass,Monitoring_objective_values
  05  for mass,Monitoring_objective_values
i think you can see it in II  right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   03  for factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
can get  2   62  factorofsafety with   01  extra mass,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can,Monitoring_objective_values
Thats great,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah it can t be,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah looking better,Monitoring_objective_values
Alright,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah the mass looks like a problem,Monitoring_objective_values
The mass is our biggest issue,Monitoring_objective_values
ms  equals to  6   72   factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
try going up by  1   try making it  41   42   43  ,Monitoring_objective_values
how will those affect your value,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s the mass factorofsafety of your subsystem ?  Mine currently is  0   99   9   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah really,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   52 ,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome,Monitoring_objective_values
how do I broadcast ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  lowest i ve gotten with an factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   1215 ,Monitoring_objective_values
how about you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Broadcast your latest values,Monitoring_objective_values
now it says  2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
minimum mass and about  2   03  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Broadcast the latest values,Monitoring_objective_values
U mean  0   672  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Broadcast the latest values,Monitoring_objective_values
sure,Monitoring_objective_values
the simulation results for me show the subsystem factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah try that,Monitoring_objective_values
just did ,Monitoring_objective_values
no  i mean  6   72 ,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome,Monitoring_objective_values
but  2   03  is good enough  we just gotta fix te weight now,Monitoring_objective_values
that factorofsafety is good since your part is pretty small,Monitoring_objective_values
 5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1   2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
any updates ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
check for broadcast ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
makes sense  I mass checking with the others to see who is using the most mass,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay  great,Monitoring_objective_values
Good,Monitoring_objective_values
Cool,Monitoring_objective_values
have you reached an ideal value for your part yet ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
is that your mass or factorofsafety value,Monitoring_objective_values
check out my latest broadcast  that looks like the best I can do,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Sorry  I think my mass is  1   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
So we are in good range right now,Monitoring_objective_values
So we are in good range right now,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass just doing what he tells me tbh,Monitoring_objective_values
haha,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  factorofsafety looking good,Monitoring_objective_values
who are you,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
You ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok my mass is down to  0   83  and my factorofsafety is  5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
same sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
hot dog,Monitoring_objective_values
Hey what do you have control over ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we re at good pull your weight,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety just went down,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
aight,Monitoring_objective_values
about  12 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety just went down,Monitoring_objective_values
havent found a combination better than   06  and  2   62 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what changed greater than ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your weight at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
and im kamran,Monitoring_objective_values
my part maintains factorofsafety equals to  2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 12  kg ?  damn,Monitoring_objective_values
wait what did you change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
thats great  im at  0   1   2   62 ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change anything ?  greater than ,Monitoring_objective_values
We need factorofsafety to be around  1   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I didnt change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
yea,Monitoring_objective_values
did you broadcast your value ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
or just go get food cz i am hungry,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright,Monitoring_objective_values
Mine has an factorofsafety of  2   42 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh I ve got a different system factorofsafety  mine is about  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get factorofsafety as  1   81  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
undo what you did,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass currently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get factorofsafety as  1   81  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   52 ,Monitoring_objective_values
im just telling you you need to start hustlin,Monitoring_objective_values
  06  and  2   63 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass is  1   7  and factorofsafety is  3   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh ok mine just updated,Monitoring_objective_values
we are so close,Monitoring_objective_values
we are soooo close,Monitoring_objective_values
We got very good,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  the mass is huge otherwise,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
perfect,Monitoring_objective_values
seems to be helping,Monitoring_objective_values
yeap,Monitoring_objective_values
for my subsystem ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   08 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Sick  our engine is now excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   08 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ah I see,Monitoring_objective_values
for subsytsem,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah it is in good range,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   42 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what did you just change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
I think the previous dimensions had us at a  very good ,Monitoring_objective_values
on my screen it says quality is excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Each part should be at  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
seems like the sim values factorofsafety over weight as far as getting from  fair  to  good ,Monitoring_objective_values
something changed we were closer,Monitoring_objective_values
something changed we were closer,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha  This is harder than if we had a group chat  ,Monitoring_objective_values
something changed we were closer,Monitoring_objective_values
no boy we need both,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety is  1   92  and mass is  1   46 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Now Im at good  weights a bit high but factorofsafety is right on,Monitoring_objective_values
you can go,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
currently my mass is  0   53 ,Monitoring_objective_values
now its  1   18 ,Monitoring_objective_values
My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
for mass,Monitoring_objective_values
what have you been in control of ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My quality is at good right now  not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone Send,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your input params besides the bore diam ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
it s at very good for me,Monitoring_objective_values
one sec,Monitoring_objective_values
That s what I mass altering,Monitoring_objective_values
now mass is  1   18 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine says Very Good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass is  1   18  and thats with both as low as they can get,Monitoring_objective_values
something happened to factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
perfect,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
are you broadcasting your latest values ?  and your factorofsafety is above  2  right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your value right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   04   no bene,Monitoring_objective_values
and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
K  what is your weight ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Sure,Monitoring_objective_values
ah okk,Monitoring_objective_values
oh,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
how about increasing factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
its  1   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I just got my factorofsafety up to  9 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ms was  2   79 ,Monitoring_objective_values
and see what happens,Monitoring_objective_values
mass at  1   63   factorofsafety at  53   27 ,Monitoring_objective_values
have you lowered mass as much as you can ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
But my mass is like  0   9 ,Monitoring_objective_values
keeping factorofsafety at  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i optimized mine as much as ic an,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
just above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i have no idea how it got changed lol,Monitoring_objective_values
But that also bumped up my mass like  0   3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hi Kamran,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you broadcasting those values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
are you broadcasting the values giving that weight ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I think the other designers have way too high factorofsafety s,Monitoring_objective_values
lets get this bread,Monitoring_objective_values
noooooooooooo,Monitoring_objective_values
NOOOOOO,Monitoring_objective_values
  2  missed,Monitoring_objective_values
I think the global factorofsafety is just the minimum value out of the  5  of us,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
we have time,Monitoring_objective_values
i thought we are done ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
im at  0   22  and  2   02 ,Monitoring_objective_values
get you factor of safety as close to  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass as low as possible,Monitoring_objective_values
do you have your factorofsafety as close to  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you have your factorofsafety as close to  2  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
use  15  for now as I try to find better values on my end,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   1   63  and factorofsafety  equals to   8  for that value,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
I ll check in with you on that in a sec,Monitoring_objective_values
got it ,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are they related ?  There is nothing in my design to indicate that they are,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any information from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any information from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha  We ve got to get our factorofsafety up to  1   5  if we re gonna get out of the poor category,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
and ,Monitoring_objective_values
Right now factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay  I ll try using that now,Monitoring_objective_values
 85  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay  I ll play around with it,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I ll try it,Monitoring_objective_values
okay sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
nvm,Monitoring_objective_values
My current factorofsafety is  7   69   what is yours ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what about you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   35   I wonder who has  0   61 ,Monitoring_objective_values
smaller is better for me as well,Monitoring_objective_values
my current factorofsafety is  1   35   connecting rod designedr has  7   69   what do you have ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my current factorofsafety is  1   35   connecting rod designedr has  7   69   what do you have ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my current factorofsafety is  1   35   conrod has  7   69   what do you have ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we should figure out who s factorofsafety is  0   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
fair,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
piston has  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
is your factorofsafety  0   44  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2  is the max factorofsafety that we neeed,Monitoring_objective_values
Mine is  3   96 ,Monitoring_objective_values
its up to  1   7  now so getting there,Monitoring_objective_values
 45  is what I mass currently using  it s acceptable rn,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   16 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
kool,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nope my factorofsafety is  5625 ,Monitoring_objective_values
so it looks like our mass is killing us now,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
No  do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh I see  yea I ll work on that now,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
how much mass is your part ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
great  thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
Currently I mass at  7   69 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your sub-system mass now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much mass is your part ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how much mass is your part ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   62  currently,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass using  85  so my mass now is  6   72 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay thats nothing,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
 2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
because my part weighs so little  ill just focus on the factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
okay that seems good,Monitoring_objective_values
its  3   24 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello  What parameters do you need from me,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello  What parameters do you need from me,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ?  ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   93  right now,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
my new factorofsafety is  3   24   did that affect yours at all ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay thats the most mass by far,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   11 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Noted,Monitoring_objective_values
connecting rod said their mass is  0   11 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my subsystem factorofsafety is reporting in the thousands  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome  thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe just the mass  the broadcast has a very large mass,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your mass  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  0   52 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
There is no benefit for a factorofsafety over  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay  my mass doesn t change that much so i can change to  20 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Try for a factorofsafety of  2  with minimum mass,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
great,Monitoring_objective_values
Not from what I understand,Monitoring_objective_values
Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay nice,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is  1   48 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Factor of safety is minimum  So one of us has a factorofsafety of  1   Is it you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay we might need to increase your,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   2   04 ,Monitoring_objective_values
but I think we re struggling with factorofsafety now,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
we only need it to be above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety coz that s minimum,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
is the factorofsafety a sum of our factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My current factorofsafety is also  1   35 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
dont we just need above  2  though ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah working on it now,Monitoring_objective_values
Currently  2   95 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Get that up  That s the reason our overall is  1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh true,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I ll be on it,Monitoring_objective_values
its already over  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we are on good rn,Monitoring_objective_values
we need mass to be less than  3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
is your factorofsafety still  5000  ish ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay,Monitoring_objective_values
with my current dimensions mass is  1   2  and factorofsafety is  15886   04 ,Monitoring_objective_values
can you get it above  2  ?  ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   1   27   factorofsafety _ s equals to  13238 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our factor of safety is greater than  2   which is excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
ill try,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Wait   13000  for factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Currently  3   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Your factorofsafety is huge,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you broadcasting it ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
excellent is above  2  but with mass lower than  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  with that my factorofsafety is now  2   17 ,Monitoring_objective_values
so even with  2   01  factorofsafety we can get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Just did,Monitoring_objective_values
its  2700 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  I mass trying to figure that out  it seems really large,Monitoring_objective_values
okay nice,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factor of safety currently,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
great  thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you broadcasting that ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
hahaha,Monitoring_objective_values

What s your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass is now  0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we just need our factorofsafety to be more than  2   ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 6   72 ,Monitoring_objective_values
we need factorofsafety up a bit more now overall,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  factorofsafety hasn t been an issue for me  it s just mass is way too high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
is your factorofsafety still  2   01   ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
That s alright  as long as we have a factorofsafety above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass at mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
not sure whose is  1   79 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i have  1   7  factorofsafety with  58  mass,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
It s just updated  now mass is  3   11  and factorofsafety is  2   07 ,Monitoring_objective_values
is your factorofsafety  1   79  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Right  Got mine to mass  equals to   1   01   and factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome,Monitoring_objective_values
re using now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
and yes I mass broadcasting that,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you changed your values any ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know if each part has a specific factorofsafety requirement  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Aim for factorofsafety to be above  2  while minimizing mass,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  as high as we can get factorofsafety the better,Monitoring_objective_values
and one sec for the other one,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Are you broadcasting ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i talked to the TA and the factorofsafety of our part is just an estimate of the whole thing  In other words  that number doesn t relate to a single person t part apparently,Monitoring_objective_values
okay ,Monitoring_objective_values
 person s,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass is currently  1   53  and factorofsafety  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values

now its  1   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeet,Monitoring_objective_values
We re done,Monitoring_objective_values
I adjusted my numbers  mass is now  0   16  factorofsafety is  4   66 ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   2   mass  equals to   6   72 ,Monitoring_objective_values
The mass increased alot do you know why,Monitoring_objective_values
right now we need to focus on mass,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok looks like we re good,Monitoring_objective_values
actually,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
Don t touch anything  We re in EXCELLENT,Monitoring_objective_values

i think i changed it to excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
its  1   52  with that,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you change your broadcast ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i changed to excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
are you still updating mass ?  we were in excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you change your broadcast ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you still updating mass ?  we were in excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
We re a little above the mass but otherwise good,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
I can give a factorofsafety equals to  6  with mass  equals to   0   4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our mass is too high again,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  that works,Monitoring_objective_values
pretty sure its someone else,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah for a second we were meeting both I wonder what just updated ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
hmm okay,Monitoring_objective_values
Not sure where the mass increase came from,Monitoring_objective_values
I broadcasted that,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your design variables currently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay sounds goof,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your design variables currently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
but our system factorofsafety is  1   25 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your design variables currently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

Yeah  my factorofsafety is minimized as well,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah that s what I ve found too,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass at  2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
so i got an factorofsafety of  3   39  and mass of  0   11 ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I broadcasted something but then i changed it now,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our factorofsafety just went down to  0   96   Is yours still good ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
our quality just went way down  did you change anything ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay thats better,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your current factorofsafety  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Can your mass be reduced at all ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

what s your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What did you guys get,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   77  is my minimum mass and factorofsafety I mass afraid,Monitoring_objective_values
no mine is  2   0 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i dropped  1  kg with  3  factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Get your factorofsafety just above  2  with as little mass as possible,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   52 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah I saw that  I haven t changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
Who is the   96  factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My piston mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing anything  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We do,Monitoring_objective_values
what s yours ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
is your fs still  2   1  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is  1215 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I think the rest of us are right around  2   0 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you making any changes  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  27   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you making any changes  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  2   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values

What s going on  bud ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Like now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 10  bucks aint bad,Monitoring_objective_values
try increasing factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
it s not me im good,Monitoring_objective_values
was your factorofsafety less than  1  now,Monitoring_objective_values
wasnt me,Monitoring_objective_values

Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
new phone who dis ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ahh nice,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
same,Monitoring_objective_values
what do you control and what do you need,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok I also broadcast my best  it gives good weight and fs,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes that is what I have input,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
so you dont need anything fom me right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yea,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know what s going on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok yeye,Monitoring_objective_values
I don t understand,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know what s going on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you know what s going on ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
which you control,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah thats what I got,Monitoring_objective_values
i think so  I think i just figured out what i need to do  I was confused at first,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  Our factorofsafety isn t too bad right now so that s probably a good place to be at the moment,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok do you have a set variable ?  In your chart,Monitoring_objective_values
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
 ok if I put a   in front of a message it has gone to everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
ahh gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
it just became  0   13  though,Monitoring_objective_values
do you need r 2  or r 3  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what i was told,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yea and increase factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
oh yeah but this communication system is a struggle,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
Di the numbers change for you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
that s cool,Monitoring_objective_values
Did,Monitoring_objective_values
What do you need from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
thought,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I just saw that  and our weight is massive,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
retweet,Monitoring_objective_values
yes and I am also playing with my numbers because I just realized now what to do  I am still getting poor quality though,Monitoring_objective_values
what s the projected mass and factorofsafety for your chosen part ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  one minute on that,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is mass equals to  0   69  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   84 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I don t know how to find that info,Monitoring_objective_values
Im still at poor quality  are you as well ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh okay ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay,Monitoring_objective_values
ya  and im at poor quality  are you as well ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
dec mass,Monitoring_objective_values
yup,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nevermind just updated broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
I think this is a trap,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important,Monitoring_objective_values
i think this is a trap,Monitoring_objective_values
It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat I have communicated the same with the others ,Monitoring_objective_values

Awesome same here,Monitoring_objective_values
okay I agree  so I need minimal for me I am thinking  But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
How is the factor of safety,Monitoring_objective_values
lol,Monitoring_objective_values
just saw that,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
who many rounds do we getr ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
get ,Monitoring_objective_values
lolololol,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the range of values you can choose ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice,Monitoring_objective_values
what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what factors does your sheet you depend on that come from other people ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes i do,Monitoring_objective_values
my highest mass option is   03  so it might be best for me to just use that and get our highest factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
wow english,Monitoring_objective_values
My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 ,Monitoring_objective_values
My current Settings are :  mass equals to  0   01  and factorofsafety equals to  0   14 ,Monitoring_objective_values

Agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
do u know how many rounds we get ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah I ve taken that as low as possible without completely ruining factorofsafety  we also need to raise that,Monitoring_objective_values
 10   7 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; ,Monitoring_objective_values
What do your factorofsafety numbers look like ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass _ s  :   14   55  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   9   04  ; ,Monitoring_objective_values
ya we can always change it too,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   24 ,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up,Monitoring_objective_values
group :  ok remember the current values you have as back up,Monitoring_objective_values
there are rounds ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
maximize factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
mass _ s  :   1   08  ;  factorofsafety _ s  :   0   83 ,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  0   24 ,Monitoring_objective_values
at the top it says round  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
dope,Monitoring_objective_values
We need to increase factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
oh mine says  11 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I think our current mass is larger than what we started,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
r 2  and r 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i think its just the number of times youve broadcasted ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
just went up to   51  overall,Monitoring_objective_values
How much mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
hey i think that made things better ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factor of safety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes,Monitoring_objective_values
That might be worth it  Maybe tell the others you re doing that,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
 12  is the best I got,Monitoring_objective_values

 1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  ,Monitoring_objective_values
also just realized that you and i are gonna have to figure out the quiz alone bc anisah left,Monitoring_objective_values
X  _  O,Monitoring_objective_values
those are my values and ranges,Monitoring_objective_values
yeahh i realized that when she got up,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok my factorofsafety is  2   03  with mass -  0   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 ERROR ,Monitoring_objective_values
cats game,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
if we all go for similar factorofsafety at around  3  we should be able to get global factorofsafety as  3  right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed,Monitoring_objective_values
it needs to be just above  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
me as i finish this semester ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
there ya go,Monitoring_objective_values
as long factorofsafety isnt below  2  keep it,Monitoring_objective_values
X X O,Monitoring_objective_values
We only need factorofsafety of  2  to get excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the range for your mass values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   28 ,Monitoring_objective_values
close game,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
almost had ya,Monitoring_objective_values
ya,Monitoring_objective_values
my turn,Monitoring_objective_values
and mine is  0   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety at for current settings,Monitoring_objective_values
what numbers are u running,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1 - 3   24 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah ive kinda just given up,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your factorofsafety at,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay  do you know who is making the factorofsafety so low ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   63  mass,Monitoring_objective_values
and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh nice,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
i think i need to change then,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nice nice,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we can,Monitoring_objective_values
yeahh i think thats what happened to most people,Monitoring_objective_values
Alright  I will try to figure that out,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   71   mass range :   1   13  to  3   12   and  4   55   factorofsafety range :   4   55  to  0   44  ,Monitoring_objective_values
thats the only reason i knew how to do hw prob 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah it s not that simple,Monitoring_objective_values
hahaha,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
LOWER YOUR factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
now 3   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok make sure your factorofsafety is never below  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
woah wait we mightve just done something,Monitoring_objective_values
all i do is fall asleep in that class tho,Monitoring_objective_values
our value is really good right now,Monitoring_objective_values
we should always report current factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
we should always report current factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
lmao ya i noticed,Monitoring_objective_values
we should always report current factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
we should always report current factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
slim if you can without chaning your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Agreed   3   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what mare mass values around an factorofsafety of  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
our value is really good right now and the  1   71  and  4   55  are my current values,Monitoring_objective_values
awesome factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
slim if you can without changing your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
good point,Monitoring_objective_values
retweet,Monitoring_objective_values
were at fair now,Monitoring_objective_values
slim if you can without altering your factorofsafety at all,Monitoring_objective_values
mass and factorofsafety for you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass equals to  4   28  factorofsafety equals to  3   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   05  factorofsafety  equals to   2   03 ,Monitoring_objective_values
like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition,Monitoring_objective_values
X X O  ;  O O X  ;  X O O,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah im pretty confident mine is not gonna work,Monitoring_objective_values
really ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
no lol,Monitoring_objective_values
its good now just mass to worry about,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok I think you are solid then,Monitoring_objective_values
oh ok yeah neither can mine haha,Monitoring_objective_values
my friend offered to help tho so we may be able to fix ours,Monitoring_objective_values
know whats our next challenge,Monitoring_objective_values
my factorofsafety is  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
connect  4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 7 X 7  fun,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your ranges ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
that doesn t make sense  you said your mass was  3   46  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is  3   57 ,Monitoring_objective_values
report weight,Monitoring_objective_values
im also at  2  rn,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety rn ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
the other thing is that i think heya is trying to get me and anisah to join her team so idk how this is gonna work out,Monitoring_objective_values
we havent added it yet,Monitoring_objective_values
ok got one,Monitoring_objective_values
ans  0   63  mass,Monitoring_objective_values
yea it was perfect a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
my value has been the same as well thanks for the update,Monitoring_objective_values
oh for sure,Monitoring_objective_values
ours just does donuts as of rn,Monitoring_objective_values
i hope they read all this,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the category ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you know whats up,Monitoring_objective_values
our value was really good did you make a change a second ago ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
keep factorofsafety around  2  never below,Monitoring_objective_values
weight is  0   86 ,Monitoring_objective_values
object ?  i dont know the options for categories lol,Monitoring_objective_values
did you make a change ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My weight is around  0   1  so I can t change it much ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
its helpful to get the ball rolling,Monitoring_objective_values
one minute ago factorofsafety is amazing yet now lol it s so bad,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello my friend,Monitoring_objective_values
 greater than  :  ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your values,Monitoring_objective_values
yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
are you chaning values and updating your broadcast ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Monitoring_objective_values
 moving,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe everyone factorofsafety equals to   2  is too low ,Monitoring_objective_values
so thats nice,Monitoring_objective_values
indeed,Monitoring_objective_values
acceptable weight now,Monitoring_objective_values
Someone is below  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
q 4  :  did we talk about it in our classes this semester ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
possibly  as in yes ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our factorofsafety dipped again,Monitoring_objective_values
LOL NO,Monitoring_objective_values
I agree but they won t respond to my messages,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah shes definitely like one of the best lecturers in ME,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah i think his factorofsafety usually gets  0   05 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Also  what is optimal in terms of parameters for you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
OK  Keep me posted,Monitoring_objective_values
yes I am,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
For the  4  simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being  1  :  ms :   21   88    2  :  ms :   30   51    3  :  ms :   49   03  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
OK,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah one sec,Monitoring_objective_values
Right now I am using  5 mm,Monitoring_objective_values
I did it do you see it ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Alright  thank you  That is the highest factorofsafety I have found,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
any suggestions ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Awesome  Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
sure,Monitoring_objective_values
sorry,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  don t think that s relevant for me,Monitoring_objective_values
got it  thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
totally unsure what  4  simulations you mean,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
no worries,Monitoring_objective_values
Our mass is too high right now,Monitoring_objective_values
Currently my factorofsafety is  3   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Perfect  I can play around with that  Let me know if anything changes,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  do you need that changed ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Optimize factorofsafety first then mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass seeing a system wide factorofsafety of  0   5 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  right now my r 2  is  0   5  and r 3  is  0   2   Is that what you need ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I will update you soon,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass seeing  1   75 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need info from me,Monitoring_objective_values
Sounds Good  I am currently at factorofsafety  equals to   2   85 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need info from me,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need info from me,Monitoring_objective_values
Has yours updated yet ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
Amazing,Monitoring_objective_values
I do not think so  you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeet,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
Cool,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nope  do you need info from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction ,Monitoring_objective_values
Alright thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeet,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your current parameters ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
do you need anything from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
okay change the other things too,Monitoring_objective_values
looks like I picked a whole bouquet of oopsy daisies,Monitoring_objective_values
my mass is less than  2   who has the biggest contribution ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I ll ask them,Monitoring_objective_values
got it  thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Yes  My current design has a mass of  0   53  and a factorofsafety of  2   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the mass of your design ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
we need to get this puppy down,Monitoring_objective_values
What is the mass of your components ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
lol,Monitoring_objective_values
Our factorofsafety just dropped a ton,Monitoring_objective_values
bark,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the mass of your system ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Cool,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay no longer good on factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
How are we looking with factorofsafety ?  Im at  4   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Need to increase factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
right now it s  11   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
How are we looking with factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the mass of your system ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass at the moment,Monitoring_objective_values
Currently is  21   49  for me  factorofsafety is  1   74 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Im at  4   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates,Monitoring_objective_values
oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates,Monitoring_objective_values
oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
How is your design coming along  do you need any data from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass good  thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
currently  0   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Do you need any dimensions from me ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

Great - let me know if you need anything from me,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   06 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  what s your system mass atm ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok thank you ,Monitoring_objective_values
 6   61 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I just updated my broadcast  I found good values that work  but I can iterate mine if need be  Just let me know ,Monitoring_objective_values
I just updated my broadcast  I found good values that work  but I can iterate mine if need be  Just let me know ,Monitoring_objective_values
just as a reference,Monitoring_objective_values
ok looks like you have the biggest   of mass in our system,Monitoring_objective_values
What s the mass that you are using ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
got it,Monitoring_objective_values
Hi what is the mass that you are currently using ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Whats your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass is  0   87 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
And also the factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
how about factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your max mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 8   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what s your max mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass is   13  and factorofsafety is  3   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
We need to work on factorofsafety  Is it just an average of all the factor of safetys ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
But factorofsafety is too low,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We re going in the wrong direction for both,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea I believe so ,Monitoring_objective_values
were in good range rn,Monitoring_objective_values
were in good range rn,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
were in good range rn,Monitoring_objective_values
were in good range rn,Monitoring_objective_values
so someone is a little confused,Monitoring_objective_values
TRUE,Monitoring_objective_values
okay now we re better lol - idk what happened,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  that was weird haha,Monitoring_objective_values
and our average is really low,Monitoring_objective_values
currenty  2   03   but that can be raised ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
Awesome  thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
thanks ,Monitoring_objective_values
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values,Monitoring_objective_values
ooo nice,Monitoring_objective_values
My dimension ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
try working more with factorofsafety if you can  Ours is so low,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my values,Monitoring_objective_values
That s good,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
sheesh that s high  have you found a good sweet spot between mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay okay,Monitoring_objective_values
ok that was what I was seeing as well,Monitoring_objective_values
perfect,Monitoring_objective_values
Yup ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Im sitting at mass  equals to   0   18  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   41   Not trying to change my value,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your system mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your system mass and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What s your system factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
yea it is,Monitoring_objective_values
holy cow someone is making major changes,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   11   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
alright ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing your numbers a lot ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok same,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   8   67 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok I think ive worked out a good combo as far as mass factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes ,Monitoring_objective_values
Sounds great to me,Monitoring_objective_values
ms :  1   17  fs :  2   0 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Sounds great to me  With my current design  mass is  0   53  and factorofsafety is  2   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I could  but in reality the goal is  2   0   I could only go upto  3   44   but it would appear that the factorofsafety issue isn t on my end ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea I don t think so either ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is the factorofsafety that you have right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
And the mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   1  and  2   55 ,Monitoring_objective_values
How much does your part weigh ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  please do,Monitoring_objective_values
what happened to our factorofsafety oh geez,Monitoring_objective_values
i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass is  0   1  right ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
i have a factorofsafety of  2   47 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I haven t changed the broadcast for awhile  it must be someone else,Monitoring_objective_values
no - must be someone else I guess ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
currently working with them,Monitoring_objective_values
ok got it,Monitoring_objective_values
okay perfect,Monitoring_objective_values
using r 2   equals to   0   7  and r 3   equals to   0   7  at the moment,Monitoring_objective_values
hmm that s weird,Monitoring_objective_values
Our dimensions line up at least,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok updated broadcast  now we re close,Monitoring_objective_values
I just dont know why our factorofsafety is so low,Monitoring_objective_values
neato,Monitoring_objective_values
I asked the other designers and the factorofsafety seems to be fine,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you changing your broadcast values a lot,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass,Monitoring_objective_values
okay nice,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok that s what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Looks like were close again now,Monitoring_objective_values
and our mass so high,Monitoring_objective_values
mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I can broadcast htat,Monitoring_objective_values
so why is our tital so low ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
total,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   13 ,Monitoring_objective_values
The factorofsafety range for others is between  2   5  and  4   09 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Heaviest Ms :   3   64  Highest factorofsafety :   6   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mass rn,Monitoring_objective_values
Great - makes sense  that s my job lol,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
sweet,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay  thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   13 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Monitoring_objective_values
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah drop that to like  1   5  if you can,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your current mass at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I feel like we should have one person changing at a time,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your mas and factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah me too  just told everyone to calm down a little 3 ,Monitoring_objective_values
first day on the job or something ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
cool thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
did your mass just change a ton,Monitoring_objective_values
mine is  0   1  so idk why our mass is so high,Monitoring_objective_values
Awesome  thank you,Monitoring_objective_values
update : ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change your mass a lot just now,Monitoring_objective_values
did you change your mass a lot just now,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is yours ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nope mine has been at  1   27 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your current mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
lol definitely  i mass keeping my values the same for now and trying to communicate with everyone,Monitoring_objective_values
oh okok,Monitoring_objective_values
 0   87 ,Monitoring_objective_values
did u change the mass a lot just now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes but i didnt broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah im not sure either  trying to find out,Monitoring_objective_values
Same haha,Monitoring_objective_values
They asked about my bore and nothing since,Monitoring_objective_values
Great - thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
and how so ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Nope  havent changed anything,Monitoring_objective_values
I think hes at factorofsafety  1   64  and mass of  2   26  but that was a while ago,Monitoring_objective_values
With my current design  mass is  0   52  and factorofsafety is  2   0 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes agreed,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass trying to do that as well,Monitoring_objective_values
Alrighty - how are your mass and factorofsafety numbers looking,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
how s your factorofsafety looking,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
TRUE,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah me too,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
What is your third field you fill out to run simulations ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok we re good I think,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok we re good I think,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok we re good I think,Monitoring_objective_values
Not by much  I can find values that work for it quickly,Monitoring_objective_values
Oh no,Monitoring_objective_values
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Monitoring_objective_values
okay let s tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok ,Monitoring_objective_values
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Monitoring_objective_values
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Monitoring_objective_values
Whoever last made change go back  it was very good,Monitoring_objective_values
and yea I am broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
yep i got it,Monitoring_objective_values
Wasn t me,Monitoring_objective_values
our factorofsafety is so low,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea  Our dimensions line up  so there may be miscommunication among other members,Monitoring_objective_values
Mass yes,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety no,Monitoring_objective_values
I am thanks for letting me know ,Monitoring_objective_values
the flywheel apparently only has a mass of  1   27 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass is  3  and factorofsafety is  1   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I will ask others,Monitoring_objective_values
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Monitoring_objective_values
can u up factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Perfect ,Monitoring_objective_values
I Havent updated in awhile so my numbers are ms :   3   64  factorofsafety :  6   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
definitely try and get your factorofsafety up ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay one sec,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah min is  2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Monitoring_objective_values
increase your factorofsafety ,Monitoring_objective_values
The min factorofsafety between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yea sure,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   66 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok I can do that,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you updated the global broadcast in a while ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
OK,Monitoring_objective_values
hmm okay i will talk with others,Monitoring_objective_values
okay we need this factorofsafety to go up,Monitoring_objective_values
your factorofsafety is in the thousands ?  ?  ?  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Just did,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
ok ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
now its  4   92 ,Monitoring_objective_values
i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you broadcasting  2   77 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok  Be sure to update the broadcast so everyone knows where we are ,Monitoring_objective_values
sure,Monitoring_objective_values
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  equals to   0   16   factorofsafety  equals to   4   66 ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you changing your values at all,Monitoring_objective_values
trying,Monitoring_objective_values
and mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah I,Monitoring_objective_values
No one is updating broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
Gotcha trying to figure out the dependencies,Monitoring_objective_values
great thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Which factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass communicating now,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the global broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
yes  with a mass of  0   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the global broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
the factorofsafety went up from  4821  to  5625 ,Monitoring_objective_values
our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad,Monitoring_objective_values
make sure you update the global broadcast,Monitoring_objective_values
ok i got factorofsafety  2   02  and mass of  5   82 ,Monitoring_objective_values
also which factorofsafety are you broadcasting,Monitoring_objective_values
and see,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Alrighty  Just updated it,Monitoring_objective_values
what ur factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
good stick with that,Monitoring_objective_values
whats ur factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
go for it,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   35 ,Monitoring_objective_values
what ur factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Factor of safety is  5000  ?  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
so do you have variable called r 2  and r 3  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
What about you ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 4   55 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hello,Monitoring_objective_values
 4   55 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah that s what I thought,Monitoring_objective_values
oh noooo go back,Monitoring_objective_values
the one that is currently broadcasted is  6   92   Thats the max i can get,Monitoring_objective_values
mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Hahaha wow,Monitoring_objective_values
 17   5  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
OK,Monitoring_objective_values
great,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  1   66  factorofsafety  1   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 7   98 ,Monitoring_objective_values
it s so bad lol,Monitoring_objective_values
What affects your mass the most ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
sounds good,Monitoring_objective_values
just did,Monitoring_objective_values
it s  5625  but my part has a weird factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Awesome,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your numbers,Monitoring_objective_values
 51  and  1   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are those three ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you broadcast that,Monitoring_objective_values
My mass is  1   12   factorofsafety is  4707 ,Monitoring_objective_values
mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I mass using   0   7    0   7   at the moment,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok I think someone is confused,Monitoring_objective_values
OK,Monitoring_objective_values
 9   86 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same here  the total simulation was very good for two seconds and that someone completely messed it up,Monitoring_objective_values
done ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
and what are your numbers when you do that,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah it sucked,Monitoring_objective_values
I mean factorofsafety and mass,Monitoring_objective_values
We need an factorofsafety of  2  don t we ?  We are at  1   1 ,Monitoring_objective_values
just got an factorofsafety of  2   03  and mass of  1   01 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok what about mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Im sticking with that,Monitoring_objective_values
these are the same values for the  very good  design,Monitoring_objective_values
great ,Monitoring_objective_values
Yea our dimensions line up then,Monitoring_objective_values
we need to do better though lol,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah  working on it,Monitoring_objective_values
the broadcasted values of  2   31  and  1   4 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 51  and  1   1  my values keep getting messed up,Monitoring_objective_values
Because they asked me for that,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah idk what,Monitoring_objective_values
our mass is already  10 kg too high,Monitoring_objective_values
OK,Monitoring_objective_values
well the grade scale shows that a total mass below  2  should be possible,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah we were over  2  about a minute ago,Monitoring_objective_values
done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
whats the best factorofsafety you ve had ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok i get factorofsafety of  5  and ms of  7 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Cus thats our weak point rn,Monitoring_objective_values
did you get your mass down ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay  Have you talked to the other subsystems about only changing one subsytem at a time ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you broadcast anything recently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
What s the updated mass for the crankshaft ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Did you broadcast anything recently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
are you using my dc dimension ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
im not sure if everyone is on board ,Monitoring_objective_values
What are your two variables at,Monitoring_objective_values
our factorofsafety still needs to go up,Monitoring_objective_values
still mass  equals to   9   86  and factorofsafety  equals to   7   98 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Interesting  the mass is what is hurting us but the factorofsafety is beautifull,Monitoring_objective_values
hahah this is rough,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok cool,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  I mass upto  2   62  now  But remember  its the minimum of all the factorofsafety that matters the most ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okay  i havent updated in awhile,Monitoring_objective_values
yes,Monitoring_objective_values
right,Monitoring_objective_values
We are good on mass,Monitoring_objective_values
Have you broadcasted anything recently ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
so  currently where are we with factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We need to meet at least one of these criteria,Monitoring_objective_values
Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
That would be my guess too ,Monitoring_objective_values
Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I am at the time we got the best result now,Monitoring_objective_values
Who is broadcasting  0   69  right now ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Are you currently changing values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values

hmmm  okay do u wnat to try that ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what are yous mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
mass  8   84  factorofsafety  4   39 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok that s good,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
did u try everyone else ?  cause our mass is too high,Monitoring_objective_values
these are the same values I had for the  very good  design,Monitoring_objective_values
what are yourmass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
Can you revert to your last simulation when we had good values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nice,Monitoring_objective_values
Ah okay  gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
Ok,Monitoring_objective_values
arent lining up,Monitoring_objective_values
what are your mass factorofsafety,Monitoring_objective_values
yep trying my best now - we need to meet at least one of the criteria,Monitoring_objective_values
 6   61   80 ,Monitoring_objective_values
I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah one sec,Monitoring_objective_values
maybe my part doesn t matter,Monitoring_objective_values
Waiting on connecting rod to change values now  no one else is at the moment,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

I have factorofsafety of  4   12  and mass of  1   44 ,Monitoring_objective_values
What parameters increaes your factorofsafety or mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
 1   3  and mass is too high,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
I just broadcasted  10    15   and  60 ,Monitoring_objective_values
 44    1   29 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Same,Monitoring_objective_values
just did it,Monitoring_objective_values
everyone else has remained the same values,Monitoring_objective_values
pretty sure no one,Monitoring_objective_values
ok can u tell everyone that we agreed to move ?  i will also ,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
what is your factorofsafety ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
nah  we only have  2  mins left,Monitoring_objective_values
A factorofsafety of higher than  1000  ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
impressive,Monitoring_objective_values
got it,Monitoring_objective_values
I don t think that s right,Monitoring_objective_values
gotcha,Monitoring_objective_values
I don t think it is an average is it ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
I asked the guy  he said it was normal,Monitoring_objective_values
Where is your factorofsafety at ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
our mass just went up  20 kg ,Monitoring_objective_values
our mass just went up  20 kg ,Monitoring_objective_values

try changing your other values ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
factorofsafety _ s :   1653   92  ; ,Monitoring_objective_values
didnt change anything,Monitoring_objective_values
can you get that factorofsafety up ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
We re close  guys,Monitoring_objective_values
yea I am doing that rn,Monitoring_objective_values
currently  1   64 ,Monitoring_objective_values
that looks good,Monitoring_objective_values
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
TRUE,Monitoring_objective_values
 2   79 ,Monitoring_objective_values
yeah that is what im using,Monitoring_objective_values
ok never mind then,Monitoring_objective_values
what factorofsafety are you broadcasting ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
okay,Monitoring_objective_values
 3   42 ,Monitoring_objective_values
ok,Monitoring_objective_values
Thanks,Monitoring_objective_values
My system factorofsafety is  2   05  atm,Monitoring_objective_values
I ve been at  4  and right around  5   5 - 5   7  for all my broadcasts,Monitoring_objective_values
uf,Monitoring_objective_values
seems like it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 tho,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what range of factorofsafety  s are you getting ?  mine are in the hundreds so it s not the limiting system,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
not me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what variables do you use ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nevermind  back at excellent now ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the  2   95  design also has the lowest mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Make sure you dont drop too much mass though,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
not for me  on mine it says fair,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
k,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
quality just went down to poor for me  seems like overall values are changing without anyone updating anything ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
interstingly pisto-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
interestingly piston-pin is the only factorofsafety under  2   but the whole factorofsafety is still quite low,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No  I do not believe so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn t have to blindly flail about  not knowing who has been told what yet,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
also you can only see a few of the design variables  so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn t as good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
aaargh I keep forgetting I have to click  check for broadcast ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
The current broadcast is good if we can trim mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
If I drop my weight way down though my factorofsafety is super trash,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine is  6   33  I can try and lower it back to  6   26 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I am at about  0   11 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I can try and trim a little more tho ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
might be piston,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Not yet,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
did you already push your broadcast ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 80   150   12   60 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
those are the same for me  Can you see any other variables ?  I can only see those  4 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I got my mass down to  0   10  i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still  2   77 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
That s ok  I control the conrod length to crank length ratio  r 1   does that affect you in any way ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
thats the smallest weight and it gives part level factorofsafety of  4   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass about to drop the factorofsafety and mass because rod designer said it might help them,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
min with highest factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
make sure it s broadcasting propperyly  I ve had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
if i go all the way to min weight is cuts factorofsafety and only shaves   03 kg,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think L 1  does affect me though,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
hmm ok,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Same for me my factorofsafety drops waaaay down and shaves only  0   12  from mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
crank is  30  lbs alone,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
back to very good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
chat with piston pin to determine that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I do not control that  All I can do is the ratio of L : r  and it s not called L 1 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alright  guess not then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Yeah  that s not on me ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I hit up the piston but they never got back to me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
  52   it s minimized,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my weight is minimized completely factorofsafety  equals to   1212 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my mass is minimized,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
at  0   1 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Lmao thats massive,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I just saved mass changing flywheelthickness to  30 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Havent heard back from piston though,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
wait what,Monitoring_objective_values
not me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I can probably drop down by another  0   01  or  0   02  if necessary,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
lets try that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
lmk when you do,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Looks like they re working with  75  right now  but just forgot to broadcast ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah check again  thats me  funny relations with crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it s corrected,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I let them know,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
factorofsafety is just whoever has the lowest value,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I let the mknow,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my factorofsafety is still  700  so we can trim something on my end,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it s corrected now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
also i forgot factorofsafety is just the minimum value not an average,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
sure give me a second,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine s still showing  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
have you talked to the crankshaft ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
idk if it helps mass though  does it ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
k  maybe not then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
piston,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
We re still seeing  80  as the globally broadcast value  Weird ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

nah chat with piston deisgner,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
check for broadcast,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
we are using  75  mm rn,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
using  85  and  15 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
and I have no variables controlled by others,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
using  85  and  15 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I have my best values broadcast with   12 kg and factorofsafety equals to  3   44 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to   75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It s up,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Projected outputs,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it is best for me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy  It seems we ve all broadcast our stuff,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I set t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4   and the quality turns out to be excellent,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so flywheeldiameter doesn t make a difference for my factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Im gonna do  150  instead,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Make sure to broad cast variables,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
make sure to broadcast variables,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Am broadcasting  150  and  50 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I used  70 mm  Try to update yours,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine shows poor,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t know how that affects me  but my simulation shows excellent  I think someone isn t broadcasting the right values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Piston pin designer said it is in very good range,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
wait someone changed something and it went way down,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass trying to test new values  I mass currently trying it with  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
they were the minimum of both,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my factorofsafety is best at  40   making it larger decreases my factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok i dont have those values in my test bed,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
So  is it good for you to be minimized ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my variables are t _ I  equals to   7   5  and r 1   equals to   4  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yes pistonpin said same thing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i ll rebroadcast with those values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what is your fs ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
with pistonborediameter equals to  53   i got mass equals to  0   13 kg and factorofsafety  equals to   3   18 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yea  but also the weight,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Thanks  I ll run some simulations with those numbers,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

or avg,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okay  I will see what i can do with  53 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i just rebroadcasted,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yeah everything is going down now  Not sure why  I haven t chantged anything for like  10  mins ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the thickness t _ I  ranges from  5  to  15  mm  and ratio r 1   ranges from  5  to  5 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I feel like its the crankshaft guy  everyone else has high factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
thickness is  10  and diameter is  22 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 85  seems good for now  testing my own combinations,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i tried  95 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the minimum mass I have while the factorofsafety is above  2  is  5   45   I have made  14  simulations to justify the result ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
My values of  150  and  50  are getting me highest factorofsafety and lowest mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It doesn t matter for me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I need a bore of at most  48 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
is that a typo ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i feel like we care about the lowest factorofsafety of all subsystems,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 ?  ?  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no it is not,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
The global variables are giving our current factorofsafety is  0   57  so I think we need to maximize that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my best values currently are flywheelthickness  equals to   10  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheel factorofsafety are all very high,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I haven t heard anything from the crankshaft guy,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Works for me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Ok  I mass talking to the crankshaft guy to figure out how it affects his factorofsafety because he is the one with the lowest factorofsafety right now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin factorofsafety remains above  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Keep  70  mm I mass trying to get out of the poor region,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
But I haven t changed anything and it went down ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I havent updated anything  so it was either crankshaft or connecting rod,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I do not believe so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
New crankshaft pin diameter :   45   Broadcast is updated,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
is  150   0  the best value ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the new one is  45  as of now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Working with you and piston as well,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so its fine,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try using  50  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
for bearingoffset  equals to   85  dc  equals to   15  flywheeldiameter  equals to   25  flywheelthickness equals to   30  pistonborediameter  equals to   70  factorofsafety  equals to   2   37 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i still have my two best broadcasted,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine is as low as possible too  We cant all have minimum mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try using  50  mm,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
Cool  and that brings the piston-pin factorofsafety to just under  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what is the lowest mass you got while keeping factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yes so run it with those values a,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Me too,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Im at the lowest possible on my sim list,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my factorofsafety is the lowest at  2   03   so you can probably make it even smaller if possible,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ve changed to the lowest mass acceptable for fs  greater than   2  for the piston,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
gotcha  I put mine at the lowest value to check it and the factorofsafety is good now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

because any factorofsafety over like  10  shouldnt really effect the system right,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i have to choose the heaviest part now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Okay  so your factorofsafety are in a slightly higher order,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
like one part has huge factorofsafety so they just minimized mass bc the part has factorofsafety over  100  no matter what option they choose,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
will do,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pass it on,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

I dont think those effect my design  Also I think we are already at an excellent rating so we shouldnt need to change anything else,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i could change so that it have factorofsafety of  2  but weights  2  kg lighter,Monitoring_objective_values
keep me posted on your diameter broadcast so I can update mine,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ive got a factorofsafety of  3   91   lets see if we can get it further above  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

same lmao,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

whyd we get bumped down,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah i have no clue,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i havent changed,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

alright yeah  I mass at lowest possible mass   0   1   and factorofsafety is  2   77 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it s good now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by   01  so probably not me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

hi,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
waaaaait my bad,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Not sure yet ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Yo,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the values I have broadcasted should generate max factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try  65 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 150 mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so connector rod is  600 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
and thickness is  7   5 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Smallest number possible is best,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Will make it larger only if you need,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Right now I have it broadcasted at  55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t know if I can get a factorofsafety over  1  with that diameter,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i dont think i have that as an input  Unless im missing something ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i can do  40  easy,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
rad,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alright  let me find my ideal values based on the  40 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
lowest I could do is  75  for the weight,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
switched to  43 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by  0   25 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ok with the minimum mass  for the flywheel  factorofsafety is still  1215 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
did I ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Can you do that ?  Right now its at  50 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It still says   51  and he said that was for the team and that I couldn t see my own  I don t know if that makes sense though ?  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I can only do  60 - 130 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
or does it at all,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I am not sure,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i switched it back to  45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Sorry  60 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ms  equals to   6   72  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i think i will reach my ideal values in a second,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheelthickness value of  10 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Good point   40  is the lower limit,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
idk what changed but quality just dropped,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
After you run a simulation you can broadcast a simulaiton,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
still  45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 Select a design to broadcast ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
  06  and  2   62 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think it should be up,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I see it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
uh  piston guy says pistonborediameter  equals to   40 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
In my simulation I increased Tf to  51   It brought the factorofsafety down ever so slightly  but brought down the mass by  2  kg for some reason,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think a flywheelthickness value of  10  is best,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
check out my latest broadcast  that looks like the best I can do,Monitoring_objective_values
Try broadcasting  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yo,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Crap  I wish it would update automaticly,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yo,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Preston,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
your part seems pretty light how large can you make the factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
that s big,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alriight,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it drops the factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
maybe lower if needed,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Um hold on ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think the factorofsafety shown is the lowest factorofsafety of ours,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
But I can try that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
seems to be maximized at  2   62  ill keep trying other values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
But i dont control that,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
idk my factorofsafety at  2  and weight minimized,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass happy with my numbers  but if you need to change something I will compensate,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
  06  and  2   63 ,Monitoring_objective_values
flywheelthickness is  10 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheeldiameter is  20 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
K  lowest I can make my weight with factorofsafety greater than  2  is  5   42  which is a big improvement,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
dont move,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
bottom,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
dont move,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i can t go lower than this,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
dont move,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
dont move,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
thats right,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Not moving even a bit  :  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
seems to be helping,Monitoring_objective_values
actually sorry i cant go below  150 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheelthickness of  10  is the best for mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
My mass is like  1 mm thick away from being its minimal value,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ll try,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

can you try  80  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
or maybe  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
on my screen it says quality is excellent,Monitoring_objective_values
i didnt change,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Each part should be at  2 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
u mean  80  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the other parts weigh  0   1   0   06   0   52  and  0   99 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
oof,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 105 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass is lowest it can be with factorofsafety larger than  2   I ll try more decimals,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
go back to what we were at,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
currently at  90 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ah  so when we broadcast we can overwrite,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
hmm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass is  0   52   factorofsafety is  2   01   and one of my values is minimized  not sure how much more I can optimize currently,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Weigght ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine says Very Good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i havent broadccasted anything new,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
If I do the lowest mass I can then factorofsafety goes down by a lot,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
hmm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
right now at  88  shows very good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

So try decimals  maintain factorofsafety greater than  2  and minimize mass ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
alright  just get factorofsafety to right above  2  and that ll have to do,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
But factorofsafety is low,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
cZ i was gonna try  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
lowest mass is best i think flywheel is the heavist thing,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
any changes ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Okay  lowest ms i can get is like  5   42 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
im going to try to change it to get factorofsafety higher and yeah I broadcasted,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no i dont have control of it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I just bumped mine up,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass trying to while considering what piston did,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i waaaaaant mooooney,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to   90  for now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
sorry  60 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 55 mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
In the current broadcast  the value is  15 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t think it is,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No  not that I know of,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Right now I mass using pistonborediameter  equals to   85 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
thickness  equals to   10 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to   15 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
something about  45 - 50  seems good  low mass and factor of safety above  2  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

where do you see  90 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
piston told me,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
That s odd  I don t have either of those variables,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
flywheel would ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass  equals to   6   72 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Maybe not,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Smaller is good  I like  45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 40  mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 40  would work as well if that helps,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
larger has a better factorofsafety but the currently I used  45  and it s just high enough,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It doesn t as far as I know  but the length of the crankshaft does  What is your current value for r ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
actually keep  45  for crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
smaller gives me a much better factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okay  I think the value is not this ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i got it from crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okay  you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
bc thats the lowest and system level factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Keeping it  45  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 40  mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
let shoot for smaller then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

What s r ?  I think they gave us different variable names,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what is your offset right now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 12  for thickness,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It just updated to  3   2   but yea  Is there any parameter you need from me ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

use thickness  10  and diameter  25  for now,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
kool,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

 person s,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
minimum is  15  and i am at  20 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yes  an old version  I mass running the simulations you requested noe,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok let me see how that effects my design,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I did  earlier,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
for pistonborediameter  equals to   85   min mass is  3   4 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ll try again with new parameters,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
if we can do that it cuts my mass to  1   24 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so really not much,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
a mass of  58  for one component automatically puts us in the poor mark,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think it s all coming from crankshaft  He doesnt seem to know whats going on,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

For pistonborediameter  equals to   75  my minimum factorofsafety is  2   85 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
We ve gotta get crankshaft down  He s like all of our mass atm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no clue,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ok  and your mass is pretty small  so it isn t a big deal  Mine is currently  27   44   so I mass trying to reduce it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
We only need above  2   so try as must as you can to lower the mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
but piston pin designer has lopw factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
both  becaus factorofsafety is pretty low too,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I am done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yep  values finalized,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
piston-pin s factorofsafety is lowest i beliver,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
that s at my minimum dimensions  I can t,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it says very good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Wait  did you just change a value ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine is  29 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i am using  60  rn,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 1215 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
but im strugling with mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
same as crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yeah  I saw that  Wondering if it s the crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i changed the mass from  50  to  30 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t actually,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I changed something but it didn t affect my mass at all,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
maybe  I ll try to go back,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Nope things changed to the worst now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
hmm okay,Monitoring_objective_values
what inputs do you control ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No mines the same,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
For pistonborediameter  equals to  85   what was your mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter  equals to   85   mass  equals to   6   72 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
and pistonborediameter  equals to   85 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try bore diamter of  40 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
piston-pin has the lowest I believe   1   67 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
will do,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 4706   67   I ve reduced my mass as far as possible,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

Mine s  2   03   Don t think I can get that lower,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
we need to get below  3  kg for the factorofsafety to really matter at this point,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Go back to your last brasodcast values  You just fucked the factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Currently I can have my piston pin part at a Mass  equals to   0   12  and factorofsafety  equals to   3   44 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
pistonborediameter equals to  75   mass  equals to   1   36   factorofsafety  equals to   2   85 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
shoot something changed,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
working on it,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass at  1   01  for mass if factorofsafety  equals to   2   03   I don t think that can get better unless a shared dimension changes,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
it was  2   79  then made a couple changes and now it  1   25 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Must be crankshaft,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 85  right now  I was trying to optimize mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mine is  1215 ,Monitoring_objective_values
Okay good  I mass at  85  too,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
we need it to be higher than  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
How about we don t change anything and let one person run simulations at a time,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so let do the best design at  45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
my best was  1   67  at a bore diameter of  45 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

truuu,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t think so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nope,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yea  I am working with my numbers to try and fix that ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

ooooo it went down but so did factorofsafety,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
its  4821   91 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
havent figured out the lowest yet but it should be around  1   15 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ok  trying to figure out who s part weighs the most rn,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
And the mass for my component is  0   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
rying to figure out who s part weighs the most rn,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Mine is at  2   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nope  thanks ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no  25  is the highest it goes ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
With t  10  pistonborediameter  25  and bearingoffset equals to  70  the output is ms equals to  0   55  and factorofsafety equals to  4821   91 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okay so my factorofsafety is over  2000  for any design parameters and the mass is less than  2  so I can t figure out how my design affects everyone,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
okie,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass guessing the crankshaft  the piston is   55  and the piston pin is  0   06 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
right now  I am at  20 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
now im using diameter  equals to   55  thickness  15 ,Exploration_of_design_parameter_values
hmm ok  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Looks good  I am at  2   03  and  0   05   equals to  mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I also have that dimension,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
have you considered using  75  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mines at  3 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a factorofsafety of  2 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

 61   91 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Mine is at  4   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so lmk if it stays at  150 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
for the last simulation it is  43 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It is,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 max,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yup ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Could yo uoptimize your factorofsafety ?  I think your weight is mainly negligible,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 40 - 70  mm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 40 - 70 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok same  what is your current diameter size,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 15  to  25 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
currently  50 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Sounds good  Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
makes sense,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I haven t changed the broadcast for awhile  it must be someone else,Monitoring_objective_values
Yeah  I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
its  80  rn,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i think so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ll try,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Diameter of  50 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
is the factorofsafety of the design the lowest factorofsafety of any one subsystem ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
nope ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
though I might switch to  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think we should be good  just don t change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
im not sure,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Ok that s what I need to know from you so keep me in the loop when that changes,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
kk,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
however i can bring it all the way down to  40  and still have a factorofsafety of  2   7 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Nevermind we getting there ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what other parameters do u change ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 2   43  which is a bit high,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
My part only accounts for only  0   1  so I can t do much for mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Have you heard from the crankshaft ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
r 2  and r 3  of the piston pin,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I don t know ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I see  have you heard from the crankshaft ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 0   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
that makes sense,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Im at  12   60  now ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
trying to lower mass of  2   43   still using  70 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think my part and yours are doing fine,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
more like first hour,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
the crankshafts mass is really high,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah it s a lot heavier,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
mass  equals to   9   86 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy then,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Hey  we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
What parameters affect your part ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast  I think someone s dimensions aren t lining up ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

got it  hmmm,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
BTW  shaved my mass down a tad  mass  equals to   0   52  now,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok change it to  84  and see what happens,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ve kept my numbers steady for a while,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think we should go with  40 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
ok will try some other variations,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
because if I go with  50   factorofsafety would be too low,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions  I think someone is not,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
woo ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

oh  60  is good,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I ve got  2  of my own variables,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

 mine,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nope,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass jumping between   0   7   0   7   and   0   7   0   8   for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Let me know if you do switch so I can update the broadcast  I found good values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Can you do  20  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Let s try  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yeah u should probs freeze,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i shit you not lol ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
thats bonkers,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Same   40  is the way to go,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I just try  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

 17   5  would be great  lowers mass a ton,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
done,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 0   55 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
right  :  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
The crankshaft by far has the most mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I haven t changed anything in the last five min,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
No,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
please please try and get those sorted out ASAP and let me know if you need anything  look at all your already run simulations and pick out the lowest mass and factorofsafety then set your values to those,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
  _   ?   _  ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Okay I mass using my results for  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i have set it to those values,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
if u want to adjust urs  u can announce to all chats,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
crankshaft is  2   11  but they say they cant decrease it anymore,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
dc ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
i wont move mine again,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Now it is  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Yeah  I mass upto  2   62  now  But remember  its the minimum of all the factorofsafety that matters the most ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think so,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Thats fine ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 12  and  60 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
by the way  I can get an fs of  10   19  if you go down to  75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so I have two variables,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think I have the easiest part lol  No one s asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
nope  haven t broadcasted in a bit  The most I can change the wieght is by like  3  anyways,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

diameter is  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
they have not been changed for the last  10  minutes,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
what is your weight at  75  and what is it at  80  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think that is an average of each designer s parts which is why I think someone s dimensions aren,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
Will do ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
 5   75     75 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
What does your system factorofsafety value say ?  mine are all like over  4000  even when i minimize mass,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
no,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
so t equals to  10  flywheeldiameter equals to  25  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

yes  piston bore is  80 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I think the lowest factorofsafety is what is broadcasted,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mass pretty sure no one depends on my variables though,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
But weight is  25 ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
yep,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
It is updated  That s my current broadcast ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
I mean  its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads  So that s normal ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
wait your flywheeldiameter is  15  now ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)

how can you maximize factorofsafety and we can work around that maybe ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Basically  if we can each keep our part factor of safety above  2  while minimizing mass  we ll be golden ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass the low factorofsafety of  2   01   can you cut any more mass out,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Try and minimize your mass but keep factorofsafety above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can reduce my mass by   03  and that reduces factorofsafety by   25  to  1   76 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

i can increase by  1  pound and factorofsafety also goes up by  1  which is a lot  can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
generally our factorofsafety is fine  we need to decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Ok  We need to try to decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
same here  any small decrease in mass lowers factorofsafety by a lot for me,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Smaller works better for my factorofsafety and Mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the factorofsafety while minimizing its mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
going with the minimum to reduce mass because my factorofsafety is so high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Let me know if you need me to decrease mass  I can decrease by  0   5  but my factorofsafety goes down by  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

Didn t change anything  We need to decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

 Copy pasting to everyone  :  We could try having everyone put their system to maximum factorofsafety  and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
alright I will try and reduce the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I think you could decrease mass bc factorofsafety only needs to be above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can increase the factorofsafety  but it almost isn t worth it with how much weight is added on,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok how much can you decrease mass before below  2  ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
try to decrease you mass while keeping a factorofsafety above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Lets decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
lets decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass not entirely sure  No matter what inputs I have  my mass and factorofsafety aren t changing and it ; s a bit confusing,Tradeoff_between_objectives
what can we do to increase your factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I tried decreasing my mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i tried decreasing my mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can t decrease mass anymore without going below a factorofsafety of  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok decrease mass as much as possible  I cant decrease much more,Tradeoff_between_objectives

what is the lowest mass you got while keeping factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Selected_design_parameter_values_for_objective(s)
try to decrease mass while keeping factorofsafety over  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly,Tradeoff_between_objectives
If you make it bigger  mass goes up and factorofsafety as well ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
basically all i can do is increase mass of the connecting and therefore increase facotr of safety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
did you just increase your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
did you just increase your mass ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
So you want to minimize mass  but increase factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

can you try decreasing your mass ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Is there anything related to an increase decrease in mass factorofsafety on your end ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
gotcha  my factorofsafety stays realtivcly high with low mass so I shouldn t have too mcuh effect on overall weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Same here  Mass has a huge effect  because we need it under  2  kg to get  excellent ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Makes sense  the connecting rod probably has more impact on factorofsafety than mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
just barely above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of factorofsafety but lower mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

Mass increases  but only by about  1 kg at most and factorofsafety increases by about  4 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
should I try to lean toward factorofsafety since my masses are about  1  to  4  and factorofsafety ranges are   5  to  3  ish ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
okay  so let s try to get a high factorofsafety  as flywheel has huge masses  and they well work on mass reduction,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Pick an factorofsafety threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold,Tradeoff_between_objectives

factorofsafety optimization would be best  Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Let s try to get all the other engineers to work on high factorofsafety even if masses are high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can hold mine above  2  and reduce but me having a high factorofsafety might brign the overall up for not much more mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
did it  need to drop more mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
it doesnt impact it much  and my part is low mass so if i have to change it  that wont be a big deal,Tradeoff_between_objectives
is there any way you can change your numbers to increase factorofsafety while keeping mass similar,Tradeoff_between_objectives
increases factorofsafety and mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i can get my mass between  0   5  and  0   6   and still have a pretty high factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We meet the factorofsafety requirement  but we lack in the mass department  Let s reduce mass ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok mine is the largest  Im gonna decrease,Tradeoff_between_objectives
If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with factorofsafety less then  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
no idea  our mass is way too high and factorofsafety too low,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can decrease my mass by   19 kg but that brings my factorofsafety down  1   49 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i can increase factorofsafety by  1   2  piston  Me if someone can decrease their mass by   9 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

whats your factorofsafety if you dropped mass by  3 kg,Tradeoff_between_objectives
whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg,Tradeoff_between_objectives
whats your factorofsafety if you drop mass by  3 kg,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Is there anything you can do to reduce mass without changing factorofsafety much ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
itll say your current mass  find the one thats  3  kg lower and then find the factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
if everone can find their lkowest mass part with an factorofsafety of over  2  that chould do it,Monitoring_objective_values

ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok somehow we now have way too much mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Which part do you think has the most mass ?  mine is small but i can chang factorofsafety a lot,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need to decrease the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need to decrease the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need to decrease the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need to decrease the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
What is your mass ?  I can increase factorofsafety but I can t decrease mass much more  its only   5 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve factorofsafety some with other parts,Tradeoff_between_objectives
yeah  I worked on lowering the mass as low as I can,Tradeoff_between_objectives
well if it lowers the mass you could raise it because it looks like we need to work on mass more,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I imagine these would contribute to more mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i mass trying to minimize weight while keeping factorofsafety around  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
so maybe try lowering your factorofsafety a lil bit with smaller mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
the alternetives are either increase weight by a bunch or decrease factorofsafety by a lot,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Increase your mass slightly,Tradeoff_between_objectives
The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by  0   03 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
try decreasing the weight while keeping factorofsafety the same,Tradeoff_between_objectives
anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the factorofsafety too much ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
as i increase it I can increase factorofsafety some,Tradeoff_between_objectives
decreasing mass is gonna decrease my factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass not sure what happened  but if you need me to change anything  let me know  From here all I can do is increase factorofsafety and mass  but we don t need that,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
could you lower the mass by  2  kg without skrewing the factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can anyone reduce weight without changing factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i can get higher factorofsafety with relatively low mass so maybe we can leverage this,Tradeoff_between_objectives
try to find a combo that gets you just above  2  factorofsafety but the lowest mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
that will increase my mass  which is where we are too high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
if you can lower mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   try to,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all ?  I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
So  I can increase factorofsafety by alot but my part would weigh  so I could,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need smaller mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need smaller mass folks,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need less mass folks,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we need less mass folks,Tradeoff_between_objectives
So I decreased weight  and kept same factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Thats great  any way you can reduce weight more then ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
not much  my factorofsafety will decrease dramatically for a drop in  0   03  mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the amss,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Cause we re still really high on weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we have our factorofsafety up  try reducing the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we have our factorofsafety up  just need to reduce the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Anyway you can reduce mass slightly,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we desperately need to reduce weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we desperately need to reduce weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we desperately need to reduce weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we desperately need to reduce weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
fair  that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase factorofsafety  I ll decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
my part minimized the mass while keeping factorofsafety greater than  2   will keep updating it,Tradeoff_between_objectives
If you can lower factorofsafety to closer to  2  we might be in business  I think we need to get below the mass limit,Tradeoff_between_objectives
minimize it if you can while keeping factorofsafety as close to  2  as possible,Tradeoff_between_objectives
i can decrase on the weight but the factorofsafety wouldn t meet requirement,Tradeoff_between_objectives
make sure to reduce weight and keep factorofsafety at  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
lets just try getting our mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
lets just try getting our mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
lets just try getting our mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
lets just try getting our mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
yeah but that increase weight by   5  gram is that worth it for you,Tradeoff_between_objectives
any way you can reduce mass ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Can you reduce mass ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass at fair quality  factorofsafety is a bit low  total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can bump up factorofsafety by like  2  for every  0   2 g of mass I add  We just need to get the rest of the mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Ok I think right now we just need to decrease mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
alright after talking with the others  the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping factorofsafety at just above  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can you bring factorofsafety down ?  it only needs to be  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
yeah agreed  it seems like every time I find a minimized mass it has very little effect  so im going to stick to maximizing factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Increasing that will allow my factor of safety to increase  Any reason we re keeping it low ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Tradeoff_between_objectives

Try to optimize your factorofsafety to mass ratio in the mean time  I think that s how we ll be able to get good numbers,Tradeoff_between_objectives
What can you change that increases your factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I don t think so  maybe try to find an factorofsafety closer to  2  and reduce the mass ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
anyway to reduce mass while keeping factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
can you reduce mass but keep factorofsafety above  2  ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Do what you need to do to get factorofsafety  greater than   1   5  and then we can adjust masses from there,Tradeoff_between_objectives
aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize the mass and have a shot at the  very good,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Aiming for a factorofsafety slightly above  2  will let us minimize mass and have a shot at the  very good  or  excellent  marks  is there anything you need from me ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Yeah  factorofsafety hasn t been an issue for me  it s just mass is way too high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
hmm  anything I can do to help reduce your mass ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the factorofsafety just above  2  ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We ve got a Good factorofsafety now  just need to get mass down,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We ve got far too much mass at the moment overall,Tradeoff_between_objectives
It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now  in terms of mass and factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
how did the mass increase by this much,Tradeoff_between_objectives
The mass increased a lot,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we are good on mass  Now we need to work on safety factor,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I haven t it increases mass and decreases factorofsafety so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn t make sense on my end,Tradeoff_between_objectives

But I have the minimum factorofsafety so I ll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important,Tradeoff_between_objectives
try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our factorofsafety significantly,Tradeoff_between_objectives

I mass working with Piston to improve my factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
what can we do in terms of slimming down mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Is there a way to lower that ?  Mass is way too high and factorofsafety too low,Tradeoff_between_objectives
So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

cool  if you can minimize mass with a higher factorofsafety  do that,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Can you find a way to increase the factorofsafety for your component ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
is it possible to increase your factor of safety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
So for my part  the factorofsafety are always very high  so I would be lowing the mass  if your part has low factorofsafety please don t hesitate to increase mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

I ll try lowering my mass some,Tradeoff_between_objectives
try and lower that mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible,Tradeoff_between_objectives
we just need to lower our mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives

whenever I lower my factor of safety it seems to be having a large effect on the overall value for just a small change in mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Ok  our factorofsafety is good now  so I think we should keep it there  Now  we need to find a way to reduce mass ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Try lowering your weight,Tradeoff_between_objectives
If you reduce factorofsafety to around  2   can we reduce weight ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
my factorofsafety is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
mine is only mass dependent as factorofsafety is very high,Tradeoff_between_objectives
no  that gives me an factorofsafety of  0   51   My mass is at most  0   12  so there s not much to be gained for reducing it but factorofsafety drops quickly,Tradeoff_between_objectives
yep  we need to lower the overall mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I think we should aim to increase factorofsafety in everyones system,Tradeoff_between_objectives

Our factorofsafety is going up and mass is going down  but we still need both to change,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I mass testing to see how a crankshaft offset affects my factorofsafety and mass  first,Tradeoff_between_objectives
same i have a minimized mass currently and stall a  3  factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We are good on factorofsafety  but we need to lower our mass ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We are good on factorofsafety  but we need to lower our mass ,Tradeoff_between_objectives

looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I cannot bring that down too much farther as factorofsafety is at  2   1 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I am updating my pin now to get a factorofsafety of about  2   1  and reduce the mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
literally dead lol - try to increase factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Your old values gave a higher mass with same factorofsafety  but not sure how it affects other stuff,Tradeoff_between_objectives
because the overall mass and factorofsafety are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago  now they re horrible lol,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go back,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We had a better factorofsafety and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I got a little better mass results,Tradeoff_between_objectives
so I mass thinking the factorofsafety of the system is the lowest factorofsafety of any individual subsystem  can you try to increase factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Great - we re getting close  I mass trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Right now we need to reduce mass and keep factorofsafety  do u want to also see if anyone can do that so its not a free for all,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I think if you minimize the mass  we can work together to get a good factor of safety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I can sacrifice some factorofsafety if it will take off a lot of mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Reduces mass let me see what i can do,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Tradeoff_between_objectives
We have a good factorofsafety so don t drastically change anyhting,Tradeoff_between_objectives

factorofsafety could increase with increase in mass but if it s already so high I don t think it matters  right ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Tradeoff_between_objectives
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Tradeoff_between_objectives
actually we just gained mass and lost factorofsafety so if you changed something go back,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Would it be possible for you to increase your factorofsafety ? ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
increase in either variable causes both the mass and factorofsafety to go up,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Interesting  the mass is what is hurting us but the factorofsafety is beautifull,Monitoring_objective_values
okay  try and get the factorofsafety even higher - we need to at least meet one of these criteria,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Okay  I played around with it at the beginning and I don t think my factorofsafety has a huge affect on the overall factorofsafety  My mass is only  3   17   and my factorofsafety is at  2   That s where I thought I would keep it for now ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Based on their mass of  1   66   they take up half the weight of the system  So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
it has a low factorofsafety for my part but it doesn t seem like mine really makes a difference,Tradeoff_between_objectives
should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall,Tradeoff_between_objectives
You have to update your broadcast and look at the total factorofsafety and mass,Tradeoff_between_objectives
hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod  my variables are l 1   length of the pin  and the inner and outer diameter of the pin  di  pistonborediameter 0  ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you ? ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
any way to reduce the flywheel diameter ?  my mass is currently  1   93  but would reduce to  1   56  if diameter changed to  20 ,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
I think my pistonborediameter _ bearingoffset makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier,Dependencies_between_design_parameters
we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
how much weigh tcan you trim generally ? ,Monitoring_objective_values
actually mine is just as good with the diameter at  80   the factorofsafety is just a little lower at  2   3 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
can you trim a tiny bit more ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Those do not effect me  I may have a slight say in crank length ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
My flywheel is as small as possible  flywheelthickness  equals to   12  flywheeldiameter  equals to   40   factorofsafety is still in the thousands ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i just changed my variables back to their minimum,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I think he ll need my Diameter to increarse  but if i do that then piston-pin factorofsafety goes below  1 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
dont change anything,Monitoring_objective_values

if any of your values changed go back to what it was,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i was at t equals to  10  and pistonborediameter equals to  15  or  20 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
It just changed back to good,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
 150  is the lower bound ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
That would increase mass  Do you mean go down ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
No I do not  I would consult the piston,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
are you still using pistonborediameter  equals to   40  ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we can make some spare weight elsewhere,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
also piston guy is using pistonborediameter equals to  40 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we need to cut down on mass,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i did it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
our quality just went way down  so if you changed anything try to change it back,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i have been,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Moving bore diameter down to  55   that will let me get a bit lighter without compriising on factorofsafety as much  Rod designer is cool with it,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
crankshaft hit the wrong button that is why i think it went back to poor,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on,Monitoring_objective_values
according to the thing on the screen it says very good,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Im still waiting for the piston diameter  but with the lowest piston diameter of  40   my factorofsafety is  2   03  with a mass of  0   05 ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
i refuse to go back to those lectures so im just gonna wait,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward,Monitoring_objective_values
what bearingoffset value do you currently have ? ,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
I have it set to max currently  so we may need to both be changing that,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
thats a good idea,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
Ok  someone changed something and made it much worse,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives
They asked and I gave them  40 mm  I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them  and they have not responded,Effects_of_design_parameters_on_objectives

can you look in the ranges,Monitoring_objective_values
it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on,Monitoring_objective_values
yes but then mass would increadse,Monitoring_objective_values
we arent at excellent we would have to drop the weight around  2 kg,Monitoring_objective_values
ill choose a word,Monitoring_objective_values

i think ive optimized my part,Tradeoff_between_objectives
minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize factorofsafety,Tradeoff_between_objectives
Well I think each individual part needs a factorofsafety greater than  2 ,Tradeoff_between_objectives
for me to have high factorofsafety i have to have high numbers,Tradeoff_between_objectives
and increase factorofsafety a decent amount,Tradeoff_between_objectives
that makes sense  i just maxed my factorofsafety right now,Tradeoff_between_objectives
I think Ive found my optimal solution so i dont really have anything to do,Tradeoff_between_objectives
