# ML-Based Modeling of Communication and Decision Making in Design Teams
When working in a multidisciplinary team, decision-making is essentially a human activity that can have a major impact on system performance in engineering design scenarios. The majority of design tasks are interdependent and require the collaboration of numerous design agents in order to meet system restrictions and increase overall performance. Researchers have attempted to comprehend and evaluate multidisciplinary design communications in order to find the factors that influence the design agents' judgments, which is perhaps unsurprising. Researchers will be able to construct socio-technical solutions that increase human capabilities in a collaborative design activity with a greater grasp of these elements. The ability to foresee changes in a system's overall performance can be aided by understanding the mechanisms that underpin team communications. The goal of our proposed research project is to use Natural Language Processing and Natural Language understanding to analyze communication patterns. We have developed a computational model to process the exchange of communication during a design process. In this repository, we have performed intent analysis using three different techniques called Supervised, Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Intent Classification to draw insights on backup behavior of team members, task initiation, team social regulation, etc on top of our baseline model.

We plan to validate our research by utilizing the Engine-Design Dataset from Design Engineering Lab (DELP) @Purdue University to calibrate and validate the model, and to infer the decision-making processes by individuals in an engineering design team.
