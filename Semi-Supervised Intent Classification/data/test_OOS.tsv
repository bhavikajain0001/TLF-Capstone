OOS were at good lets leave it
OOS I have not decided yet. What would help you most?
OOS according to the thing on the screen it says very good
OOS 40 inches.
OOS what mass are you getting?
OOS yes
OOS 5.2
OOS Have you chosen a crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS how can you maximize fos and we can work around that maybe?
OOS I don't know if I can get a FOS over 1 with that diameter
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS my bad lol the range of mass is like 0 ~ 0.1 ish
OOS haven't changed anything on my ene
OOS thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length
OOS Who is the fly wheel designer ?
OOS if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
OOS Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
OOS what is your FOS
OOS I think you need to change your c value
OOS But that also bumped up my mass like 0.3
OOS ahh gotcha
OOS And the mass for my component is 0.55
OOS it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
OOS go for it
OOS Yes
OOS or maybe 80
OOS group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
OOS mines at 3.84
OOS yes, that was what I was thinking
OOS Is there a tf that works best for you?
OOS are we content with very good?
OOS my bad, thanks 
OOS Okay
OOS we can make some spare weight elsewhere
OOS group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
OOS Hold where you are
OOS awesome! go team
OOS oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
OOS retweet
OOS I think the other designers have way too high fos's
OOS How are we looking with FS?
OOS my mass is 0.52
OOS You?
OOS that works for me too
OOS 2.31
OOS Does a larger thickness negatively affect fos or mass?
OOS piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
OOS Same
OOS (piston head)
OOS Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
OOS what you need and what you have
OOS I didnt change anything
OOS that wasnt me
OOS Group: I will decrease mine now
OOS we got it!
OOS good working with ya even though we didnt get to talk much
OOS what are your ds and tf?
OOS t_f = 12.0 and d_s = 60.0
OOS no I do not think it does, I was able to get my FOS up above 3.4 though
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS flywheel says they have an FOS of 3286 apparently?
OOS Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot.
OOS Sorry, mass 25.69, fos 1.45
OOS Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
OOS were good
OOS Flywheel guy is also in on it
OOS What does it change for you?
OOS wonderful system, this is.
OOS If I do the lowest mass I can then FOS goes down by a lot
OOS what variables are you considering?
OOS good?
OOS i'll look and see if there are any
OOS i haven't either
OOS my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
OOS that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
OOS We once had an excellent quality though
OOS George?
OOS Ok, right now my r2 is 0.5 and r3 is 0.2. Is that what you need?
OOS Do you have a value for piston bore diameter?
OOS Where exactly do i check that?
OOS I think the previous dimensions had us at a "very good"
OOS That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and FOS?
OOS I'm the low FOS of 2.01, can you cut any more mass out
OOS yeah min is 2.77
OOS it just said very good
OOS sounds good
OOS lol ya slight L but were still hanging on
OOS we are at excellent now
OOS X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
OOS mine is 2.09
OOS are you changing things
OOS I have it low as possible
OOS Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
OOS OK STOP
OOS we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
OOS Just did max, 105!
OOS Can you try and minimize your bearing offset? I'm getting the best results for a bearing offset of 60
OOS since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
OOS only (c) affects my Fos.  Butmy Fos is in the range of thousands so I don't think it matters too much.
OOS whats your fos
OOS OK STOP
OOS my part is a lot of the total weight
OOS someone changed it again
OOS q5: is it a windshield wiper
OOS Whats your current diameter?
OOS Are you changing your broadcast values a lot
OOS 5625
OOS Yeah i have the connecting rod at minimum thickness
OOS i think that will raise my FOS and lower weight
OOS kmaybe not
OOS i'm trying to minimize the mass of crankshaft and factor of safety
OOS *anyone has lower FOS change when mass dec?
OOS I have the best broadcast available for my thing
OOS my mass is 3.13 (the lowest option) and FOS is 0.58
OOS ok we are good
OOS nah dont do that
OOS My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone  Send
OOS what piston bore diameter are you using?
OOS Yeah, I saw that. Wondering if it's the crankshaft
OOS what's your current value?
OOS 82.5 is good
OOS What is your FS
OOS mass 1.83 and  fos 1.92
OOS are those variables L and r?
OOS Does 2.09 affect mass significantly?
OOS What piston diameter are you using that works well?
OOS Looks like our FOS went up
OOS can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
OOS lowest mass is at D=40
OOS totally unsure what 4 simulations you mean
OOS I havnt changed anything
OOS What is your piston bore diameter right now
OOS Im going to reduce piston D to 75 to see what happens
OOS Ok, i was just wondering if any of my parameters need to be entered into your catalog to get the correct mass and fos values
OOS new c is broadcast
OOS great
OOS Ok. We need to try to decrease mass
OOS We're good
OOS were in good range rn
OOS yes but i didnt broadcast
OOS what is your mass?
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS *and gets called out for it*
OOS okay
OOS Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
OOS but then
OOS mine is 0.1 so idk why our mass is so high
OOS same
OOS we got it, don't change things
OOS but I can slightly increase mass to get 2.63 FOS
OOS See if you can bump that up
OOS i think i need to change then
OOS grp-im done
OOS Hey what do you have control over?
OOS what's your mass and FOS
OOS no
OOS yes
OOS sounds good ill do 45
OOS hey try changing the diameter to 90
OOS are you changing the variables?
OOS and keep D lower
OOS yeah that is what im using
OOS ms:1.17 fs:2.0
OOS can you lower the r values
OOS Go fast theyre giving out the money
OOS but D has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve FOS
OOS wait what did you change?
OOS Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
OOS !
OOS at 0.1
OOS 1.64
OOS it requires piston bore diameter, any range from 75 to 105
OOS mine is currently m=0.02 and FOS=0.22 but my max FOS is 0.24
OOS Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system?
OOS okie
OOS Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
OOS we are in excellent!
OOS FOS coz that's minimum
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS Or rather, what affects it
OOS can we submit now?
OOS the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter
OOS Broadcast the latest values
OOS still maxed at 1.23
OOS Right now I am using 5mm
OOS for c?
OOS It's been good working with Yall
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS is your current value exactly 90?
OOS can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
OOS Don't think so
OOS Have you been changing the piston and seeing how the piston-pin can be changed?
OOS I'm trying to do that as well
OOS ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
OOS I can sacrifice some fos if it will take off a lot of mass
OOS interesting
OOS ok it went up to 300 rn
OOS I have lowest mass output selected currently
OOS No idea
OOS yeah i think his fos usually gets 0.05
OOS fos is bad
OOS bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
OOS you can change it and change it back if it gets worse
OOS ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed
OOS Cool
OOS Thank you
OOS 60
OOS what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
OOS I have my best broadcast for the available thing
OOS I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
OOS everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
OOS Who changed it
OOS Anything you need from me yet
OOS I agree. My part increases in weight linearly and increases in FOS exponentially so its probably better to maximize it. Do you have a part that increases in FOS only linearly? you can see it on the graphs
OOS did oyu change?
OOS looks like we're done?
OOS I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
OOS yep
OOS we can both move. i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it
OOS So, I can increase FOS by alot but my part would weigh, so I could
OOS ok that's good
OOS 1.35 i mean
OOS we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
OOS what r do you have for the pin?
OOS Not from what I understand
OOS gg team
OOS 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
OOS Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
OOS flywheel - update the group when you change!
OOS I have D at 40
OOS might be piston
OOS hmm
OOS Hi how is it going?
OOS back at80
OOS New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS yep i got it
OOS any preference on the piston bore diameter?
OOS Easy $20 :D
OOS mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
OOS the flywheel apparently only has a mass of 1.27
OOS no nothing affects me
OOS what are you FS/Ms at rn?
OOS It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
OOS i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
OOS try working more with FS if you can. Ours is so low
OOS yes
OOS do you need anything from me?
OOS what fos are you broadcasting?
OOS we're at good
OOS k, maybe not then
OOS Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
OOS Have you changed your values any?
OOS Alrighty. Just updated it
OOS what was the diameter you use?
OOS Great - we're getting close.  I'm trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values
OOS i haven't updated
OOS I havn't changed it since the beginning
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS 61.91
OOS ok mine is like .5-1 so im trying to change fos more
OOS im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
OOS I think it's at 2 right now
OOS i have no clue whats happening with that. my mass is too low to have an impact
OOS I'm at 2.77 now, all my numbers are at their minimum 
OOS sure
OOS ok good. I would just assume your part has the most mass
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS only need a fos of 2
OOS okay nice
OOS Do you need info from me
OOS we're at excellent
OOS What's your flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel?
OOS Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
OOS what is your mas and fos?
OOS gotcha
OOS I'm good too
OOS I changed something but it didn't affect my mass at all
OOS check with the others
OOS yes
OOS and how so?
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
OOS 0.91
OOS Mine is in the range of thousands.  So i guess I don't have to worry about it? only the smallest matters right
OOS who many rounds do we getr?
OOS No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
OOS so If i maximize both my design variables
OOS Amazing
OOS i switched it back to 45
OOS Do you know how changing D effects your numbers?
OOS it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at 2.03, so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety, that would be ideal
OOS nope
OOS Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
OOS are you making any changes ?
OOS Our dimensions line up at least
OOS Ok do you have a set variable? In your chart
OOS Ok, mine is only .5. Idk how fos works but mine goes above 5k
OOS mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
OOS what's your mass ?
OOS yo bro
OOS i could change so that it have fos of 2 but weights 2 kg lighter
OOS My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
OOS it's 5625 but my part has a weird fos
OOS D= 47.4 or 40 for me
OOS without going above D = 42
OOS 0.13
OOS no worries
OOS we can try smaller mass
OOS does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
OOS I have t1, L, and r
OOS what is your mass rn
OOS GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
OOS Group- only piston engineer edits
OOS I think 75 is the best right now
OOS Is higher or lower D better for you?
OOS mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
OOS cool. not touching anything
OOS 11.3
OOS We at fair. Good enough?
OOS mine is only mass dependent as FOS is very high
OOS wait in the complete range?
OOS (i think)
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS Also, does me increasing c help you at all?
OOS which do you need
OOS ok
OOS our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
OOS It's 3.41
OOS I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS No
OOS can you change it just to see
OOS i think ive optimized my part
OOS we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs
OOS Whichever gets you the highest
OOS What's your FoS?
OOS Mass: 1.75 FOS:6.07
OOS Im at 2nd lowest mass
OOS I'm going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it
OOS Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod?
OOS the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team
OOS Looks like were close again now
OOS Who changed it
OOS ?
OOS yes
OOS were in good range rn
OOS from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
OOS I can increase the FOS, but it almost isn't worth it with how much weight is added on
OOS what are yourmass/fos
OOS it was 2.79 then made a couple changes and now it 1.25
OOS what's your fos
OOS Yea i believe so. what is it?
OOS Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
OOS Hey, how are your masses and FS looking? Ranges?
OOS What is the bearing support offset you are using?
OOS Perfect!
OOS he and i talked
OOS REFRESH IT, ITS LOWER THAN 2 RIGHT NOW
OOS Just broadcasted it, looks like 55 for D was a good choice
OOS did you get your mass down?
OOS did you try playing around with bearing offset ?
OOS there are rounds?
OOS agreed but isnt the factor of safety shown above that of the part with the lowest fos?
OOS Im at 0.1 rn with a fos of 2.52
OOS Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
OOS and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS (D) piston bore
OOS I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
OOS our mass is already 10kg too high
OOS we may reduce D just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass
OOS What's your system mass and FOS?
OOS me either
OOS something changed we were closer
OOS No only the inner piston bore diameter
OOS hey what changes in mass have you noticed (if any) when you change the bearing support offset?
OOS Large. 3852.93
OOS 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
OOS i need to determine a piston diamter first because i think that is most important of my two variables
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
OOS We got very good
OOS our quality just went way down, did you change anything?
OOS D = 40 works best for me if you can make that work
OOS what up
OOS So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS Yo
OOS alright thank you
OOS Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
OOS your FOS is in the thousands????
OOS Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow
OOS I do not believe so
OOS okay I'll keep lowering it
OOS Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
OOS m=3.48
OOS okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
OOS If that's the same as the thickness of the connecting rod, then I'm currently at 2 mm
OOS th, D, m, fos
OOS I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
OOS Can you send me your mass?
OOS More than 2 is excellent
OOS nope. thanks.
OOS group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
OOS Will do I wrote them down
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS what is the lowest mass you got while keeping FOS above 2?
OOS haha
OOS group - same with piston-pin
OOS Could you try decreasing it again? I'm trying to raise my FOS more since my mass is so small
OOS on it
OOS flyweel is good too
OOS I just got my mass down to 0.11
OOS Nope, only need one thing from the piston
OOS What's the best crankshaft offset?
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS do we just sit here now?
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
OOS ?
OOS Well you've got the crankshaft, it should be the heaviest
OOS yeah
OOS I have control over D
OOS so someone is a little confused
OOS connect 4
OOS lmk what you think
OOS 1
OOS yes. d from 20 to 15
OOS Ok
OOS yup thats working!
OOS I think we need a larger shaft diameter and smaller thickness
OOS Yo
OOS Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
OOS Someone picked an FS of 0.51
OOS Me neither. I think it was flywheel?
OOS I have the piston set to near lowest mass (m=0.69 and fos = 3.84) sending this to everyone
OOS I choose the part with lowest mass and FOS above 2
OOS you need to change your current broadcast
OOS its 1.52 with that
OOS Are you currently changing values?
OOS Yea I believe so.
OOS I also have that dimension
OOS No i changed th piston head thickness but not the diameter
OOS What levels of mass are you dealing with?
OOS how do I broadcast?
OOS i havent changed anything
OOS What's the updated mass for the crankshaft?
OOS Are you good with the results?
OOS nevermind, back at excellent now.
OOS our weight is too high
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
OOS was your fos less than 1 now
OOS _|X|_
OOS its 80 rn
OOS ok looks like you have the biggest % of mass in our system
OOS thats what they were at when we had excellent
OOS our value is really good right now
OOS I am also not trying to change the design form here.
OOS what are your numbers
OOS unless it drastically changes the mass
OOS yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by .01 so probably not me
OOS What are the the piston bore diameter are we making?
OOS group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
OOS got em
OOS I was asked to keep my parameters constant
OOS i can do 40 easy
OOS mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
OOS ok got one
OOS We're done
OOS shows it as broadcasting for me
OOS What is our piston Bore?
OOS whats the best fos you've had?
OOS i asked
OOS im not surprised,he has a pretty big head
OOS group: who wants to go next?
OOS Ok. Our FOS isn't too bad right now so that's probably a good place to be at the moment
OOS now poor
OOS Don't change anything
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
OOS mine is m=0.69 and fos = 3.84
OOS piston head thickness and piston bore diameter
OOS if i go all the way to min weight is cuts fos and only shaves .03kg
OOS Is 70 the best value for bore design or have you not messed with it yet?
OOS What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
OOS done!
OOS okay, i havent updated in awhile
OOS ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
OOS says very good
OOS group: how much does your part currently weigh
OOS Right now I have D=85
OOS my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
OOS I have my best broadcast for the available thing
OOS our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
OOS Awesome, thank you
OOS can you bring FOS down? it only needs to be 2
OOS 2.77 for a diameter of 40
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS what do you need
OOS ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
OOS The diameter is now at 40.
OOS updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
OOS Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
OOS Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
OOS nope
OOS we are at excellent agian
OOS *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
OOS what factors of the crank shaft?
OOS If I hold my variables same, the lower the diameter, the lower the Ms and fos
OOS yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
OOS everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
OOS i control Ti and r1
OOS We are good, he said his FOS went up when I changed it down to 45
OOS Our fos just dropped again
OOS ok sweet
OOS our weight is the high bit
OOS as i increase it I can increase FOS some
OOS Ok thank you.
OOS Did you broadcast anything recently?
OOS broadcasting 2.85 with a mass of 1.36
OOS I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
OOS is that your ideal dim?
OOS I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
OOS Hell to the yeah
OOS lets decrease mass
OOS what have you been in control of?
OOS i dont want to mess it up
OOS Do I have any variables that affect your result?
OOS our value is really good right now and the 1.71 and 4.55 are my current values
OOS aight did you broadcast anything?
OOS I havent updated anything
OOS Diameter and thickness
OOS no I don't need either
OOS I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
OOS no problem
OOS not me, at lowest weight possible
OOS No, that does not affect it either
OOS I'm gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
OOS you need values from me?
OOS it still doesnt
OOS try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our fos significantly
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS maybe lower if needed
OOS You'll need to broadcast that. The most recent broadcast value we have is 80.
OOS they said they ddnt
OOS Hi, looks like we should increase the factor of safety. What factor of safety do you have for the piston
OOS Ok
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS Yeah me too, just told everyone to calm down a little3
OOS sweet
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS do you need my thickness to increase?
OOS Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
OOS piston-pin is not responding
OOS it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
OOS 75-105
OOS that wasnt me
OOS piston
OOS diameter is 25 mm
OOS 18.63 and fos = 2.06
OOS 1.27
OOS huh I would ask a TA then,
OOS yeah Im doing that after every sim, we're already in the very good range
OOS what are your values
OOS okay
OOS crankshaft offset*
OOS yeah that's what I thought
OOS ok no one anything
OOS what do you control!
OOS sounds good, flywheel now needs to check theirs i think
OOS is your objectives different?
OOS Our FOS just dropped a ton
OOS Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
OOS my mass is 1.12
OOS End experiment, nice worK!
OOS u mean 80?
OOS I mean Fs only needs to be greater than 2
OOS I can try, that is the limit tho
OOS crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
OOS and yes I'm broadcasting that
OOS What are you broadcasting?\
OOS Okay, so your FS are in a slightly higher order
OOS i dont think so
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS 0.1 and 2.55
OOS 2.77 is my minimum mass and fos I'm afraid
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS what is your pin diameter?
OOS maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
OOS Thanks. If 40mm doesn't work let's see if we can meet in the middle somewhere
OOS Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
OOS m = 0.12 with f at 3.44
OOS I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
OOS something changed we were closer
OOS How much mass?
OOS ok
OOS my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
OOS we are 1.94 over mass rn
OOS I'm seeing 1.75
OOS wait can you explain again
OOS Good point, 40 is the lower limit
OOS let me know if you need to go any lower
OOS If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with FS less then 2
OOS my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS ayyyyyy
OOS sounds good
OOS I dont no
OOS What are your initial ideas for bearing offset?
OOS i'm not
OOS Ah okay, gotcha
OOS are you changing stuff?
OOS okay can di
OOS okay so I think i need a smaller Piston Bore diameter
OOS as long as you dont dramatically decrease your Fs because i think most oif it is coming from you
OOS Agreed. 3.05
OOS thats getting better, Im working w the piston to find the best D and will let you konw when we do
OOS wait so I asked piston to lower his mass. So now my fos is lowered to 70, 
OOS we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
OOS connecting rod thickness (t1) and connecting rod length ratio (r1)
OOS 12 kg? damn
OOS The mass increased a lot
OOS check for broadcast
OOS Ok, any luck getting it back to excellent?
OOS the one guy did not respond to my message
OOS Yes
OOS No, I do not believe so
OOS just did
OOS My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
OOS did you change?
OOS one second
OOS for ds tf and stuff
OOS based on the current values, it should say excellent
OOS anyway to reduce mass while keeping fos above 2?
OOS mass as low as possible
OOS agreed
OOS the other parts weigh 0.1,0.06,0.52 and 0.99
OOS m_s : 10.4;   fos_s : 7.37;
OOS Does it look to you like we're meeting the global requirements now?
OOS yeah but that increase weight by .5 gram is that worth it for you
OOS if im not stupid
OOS It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now, in terms of mass and fos
OOS The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
OOS just barely above 2
OOS someone touched it
OOS i did it
OOS What kind of bore diameter are you thinking?
OOS what is the bore diameter?
OOS Do you know who controls those factors?
OOS how much does that effect your numbers
OOS is that your mass or FOS value
OOS i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
OOS I'm not entirely sure. No matter what inputs I have, my mass and fos aren't changing and it;s a bit confusing
OOS let me know if you need anything from me
OOS should I try to lean toward FS since my masses are about 1 to 4 and FS ranges are .5 to 3 ish?
OOS they were the minimum of both
OOS TA is saying time is up
OOS oops, wrong value, my bad
OOS You?
OOS *increaseing
OOS Is there anything I can do to help you?
OOS I'm on second lowest diameter at the moment
OOS and crank pin diameter
OOS try flyweel thickness as 12.0 and shaft diameter as 60.0
OOS oh mine says 11
OOS Yeah I just saw that. and our weight is massive
OOS Do you need info from me
OOS Me too
OOS I hit up the piston but they never got back to me
OOS sounds good, ill do 45
OOS sorry, I just need D as well
OOS i didnt move
OOS mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
OOS maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
OOS we are at very good again as of 12;53
OOS Hello, Do you need any parameters from me? 
OOS right, but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations? Do you have one?
OOS i dont think it actually changes the FOS
OOS I have the piston bore diameter set to 47.5 currently
OOS What's your current FOS?
OOS 1.14
OOS doe increasing D give you better weight?
OOS It looks like our engine design is excellent then. And yes that works with my design requirements
OOS Please do
OOS larger piston bore increases both m and fos
OOS Piston bore diameter?
OOS What is your range for diameter?
OOS nice
OOS sure
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter
OOS record your current value
OOS I think it's all coming from crankshaft. He doesnt seem to know whats going on
OOS yeah
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS yep...
OOS Right now its at 90
OOS have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
OOS Make sure you dont drop too much mass though
OOS Yeah
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
OOS My FS is around 2. Some parts may just have different ranges
OOS how you doing
OOS Yea flywheel is the problem
OOS What is your current FOS?
OOS 0.1/2.77
OOS so thats nice
OOS tf of 10 is the best for mass
OOS WE are GOOD
OOS It just changed back to good
OOS wait*
OOS I'm going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass, we're not doing too bad with fos
OOS AMAZING FOS
OOS stop changing
OOS I'm seeing a system wide fos of 0.5
OOS nice
OOS It might be the flywheel or crankshaft folks
OOS hello
OOS 1.38
OOS what is your mass currently?
OOS okay
OOS do you think increase fos of lighter componet while decreasing fos of my part will work?
OOS GOOD
OOS I cant decrease the weight without decreasing the facto of safety below 2
OOS currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
OOS piston is in charge of the diameter
OOS i just reduced my mass
OOS we got it
OOS I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
OOS it just went back to "poor"
OOS So we can keep it low
OOS We're good
OOS Well it's between 40 and 70 so maybe like 55 to start? I'll run some simulations
OOS Ok. I just updated my settings to be m=0.02 and FOS=0.22
OOS does your design depend on the crankshaft?
OOS hmm
OOS ok guys looks good
OOS who are you
OOS What can you change that increases your FOS?
OOS can we make it better?
OOS oh okay my handout said piston pin diameter should be displayed but isnt
OOS whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
OOS m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
OOS What's your fos?
OOS back at 80
OOS because the overall mass and FOS are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago, now they're horrible lol
OOS try bore diamter of 40
OOS we are at very good
OOS Anything else I can help optimse?
OOS I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
OOS agreed
OOS thats the smallest weight and it gives part level fos of 4.55
OOS 0.52
OOS ms=0.52 fos=1215
OOS bad change, not me
OOS "Select a design to broadcast"
OOS any preference on the piston bore diameter
OOS I can chang the diameter
OOS no
OOS No I have not
OOS I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
OOS D ds and tf
OOS 3.03
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
OOS do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters?
OOS Thanks
OOS nobody change anythibn
OOS do you know if you can reduce mass?
OOS I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS basically c = 85  and dc =15
OOS how do i know it wasnt you??
OOS we reached good
OOS my fos is 0.24
OOS Hello
OOS What did you guys get
OOS my part maintains FOS=2.06
OOS hmm
OOS if we could decrease for another 2 kg we should get excellent
OOS what are your input params besides the bore diam?
OOS in the table with the simulations is what we get from our own parts
OOS Yeah, I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me.
OOS do you depend on t1 or r1?
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS mine says Very Good
OOS terrible
OOS ms: 1.71, fos: 4.55
OOS what is yours?
OOS did you get very good simulation?
OOS same
OOS Increasing the diameter will increase both factor of safety as well as the mass
OOS fake
OOS yeah same
OOS As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
OOS What's your sub-system mass now?
OOS masses in the hundreths
OOS Yeah I agree. I'll see what they can do
OOS Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
OOS nice, mine is a lower D gives lower mass and fos doesnt rly change
OOS oof
OOS $2 missed
OOS Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
OOS any good values for the piston bore D?
OOS That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS lower increases my mass and FOS
OOS Have you changed bore diameter at all?
OOS whats your mass
OOS do you need to know any flywheel variables?
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel Shaft Diameter
OOS ok
OOS the fos went up from 4821 to 5625
OOS increase in either variable causes both the mass and FOS to go up
OOS sorry team just realized i wasn't broadcasting mine
OOS FOS just went down
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS one sec
OOS what are your values now?
OOS we were at excellent but now its very good
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS Ok, and your mass is pretty small, so it isn't a big deal. Mine is currently 27.44, so I'm trying to reduce it
OOS Just did. I think that made it heavier
OOS know whats our next challenge
OOS right now we need to focus on mass
OOS i see
OOS 60 mm
OOS I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
OOS Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
OOS group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
OOS Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
OOS ya'' should chat about that
OOS gg team
OOS you need to broadcast your simulation results. after simulating, you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results
OOS 12 is the best I got
OOS we had "good" at one point didnt we?
OOS alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
OOS 2
OOS the thickness(t_I) ranges from 5 to 15 mm, and ratio(r1) ranges from 5 to 5
OOS duh
OOS and what are your numbers when you do that
OOS try and use 60 for C
OOS Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
OOS No, I'm at 3.23. Trying to drop that a bit and lower my mass. I'm at 2.11 for mass.
OOS Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
OOS grp-im done
OOS what variables affect your decisions
OOS and piston  diameter will affect my performance quality
OOS I did it do you see it?
OOS our mass just went up 20kg...
OOS The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers
OOS so we need to work together for c
OOS That is my highest fos value
OOS if you can lower mass while keeping fos>2, try to
OOS do those have names or are they just called that, I think you might control something I'm not seeing for some reason
OOS You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his.her mass, crankshaft is the heaviest part
OOS c=60, dc=15
OOS yes
OOS are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness
OOS How is your design coming along, do you need any data from me?
OOS whats your current FOS ?
OOS right now its 40 yes
OOS ok we're close
OOS thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
OOS now3.05
OOS I just updated it to that. I'll let the other people know
OOS I don't know how to find that info
OOS No I'm using the crankshaft bearing offset
OOS I currently have the lightest mass and it is still too much.
OOS okay. my mass doesn't change that much so i can change to 20
OOS Who changed it
OOS ds = 50
OOS Same here, the total simulation was very good for two seconds and that someone completely messed it up
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS not me
OOS its too low to have the impact it is having
OOS someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
OOS Oh I see, yea I'll work on that now
OOS Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
OOS We're a little above the mass but otherwise good
OOS decrease mass
OOS Is that value working for you or would it work better if D was larger
OOS difference of about 0.1
OOS we still need to reduce mass by a lot
OOS X X O ; O O _ ; X O _
OOS Not too bad, not excited for the lab
OOS my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
OOS 1.3 and mass is too high
OOS ds is 20
OOS keep it up and we'll trim from there
OOS 3.05
OOS I'll send a message too see if they'll respond
OOS ?
OOS 58
OOS whats your fos? mine is 2.09, piston is 2.09 as well
OOS Ok that doesn't affect mine
OOS Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
OOS Not sure yet.
OOS or global?
OOS Yep, values finalized
OOS I think the flywheel is changing
OOS bearing support offest
OOS i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
OOS 2.04
OOS what diameter should i use. i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of 97.5
OOS I think your part is ok to be heavier
OOS yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
OOS Don't worry, you're a pistonpin you can do anything
OOS nice!
OOS did it.  need to drop more mass
OOS ok somehow we now have way too much mass
OOS .06 and 2.62
OOS What's your current FOS?
OOS not yet, might change to thickness 12 diameter 40 because my FOS is huge
OOS Are you still using 80 for your diameter?
OOS 2
OOS trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
OOS idk...
OOS What requirements do you have on the Piston bore diameter?
OOS piston pin has theirs at 1.23 and says that's their highest option
OOS ok
OOS our mass just went up 20kg...
OOS What mass ranges do you have the option of?
OOS Alright, b/c we have the given parameter LDr = 1.2 and I have control of D
OOS What's your system mass and FOS?
OOS Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
OOS I'm not sure how this works tbh haha
OOS Did you make any change after it was at very good?
OOS Update it I'm at excellent now
OOS oh the round number is the simulation number
OOS I'm jumping between (0.7,0.7) and (0.7,0.8) for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass
OOS Do you need any info from me?
OOS Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too
OOS good work
OOS i dont htink piston did either
OOS BTW, shaved my mass down a tad. m = 0.52 now
OOS hello
OOS OK
OOS 170 is working for me
OOS I just dont know why our FS is so low
OOS There?
OOS So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
OOS whats dc
OOS Yes, my most recent design is what is broadcasted
OOS great - please leave it there
OOS i am interested in the crankshaft bearing offset by another designer
OOS btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
OOS Just did
OOS current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
OOS No i don't think so
OOS like i kinda dgaf about 375 anymore
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS sorry 225 first
OOS So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers?
OOS It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn't have to blindly flail about, not knowing who has been told what yet
OOS we got it!
OOS oh 60 is good
OOS Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
OOS ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
OOS yeah
OOS Yeah i figured that out when mine was lowest lol
OOS group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
OOS Awesome same here
OOS Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
OOS mass
OOS no - must be someone else I guess?
OOS 20.86
OOS what's your current bore diameter
OOS no
OOS we have our fos up, just need to reduce the mass
OOS can you get it above 2?\
OOS Nice.
OOS I'm at the 4th lowest weight I can be at out of 25 options
OOS smallest
OOS When I use maximum values, the mass is 36.38 and f is 22.95.
OOS I think i have my ideal broadcast
OOS _|O|O
OOS Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
OOS itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
OOS i broadcasted my best
OOS no they remain the same
OOS Let me decrease my thickness a bit
OOS hello
OOS great, done then
OOS (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
OOS Projected outputs
OOS excellent?
OOS crankshaft is talking, but he/she depends on flywheel
OOS so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
OOS ok i get fos of 5 and ms of 7
OOS ahh, its changed for me
OOS i havent really started yet
OOS Okay no longer good on FOS
OOS ya we just lowered it all the way, how are your numbers
OOS yeah
OOS Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all?
OOS I dont think we were supposed to finish that quick
OOS Recheck your broadcast. it just went to poor
OOS Diameter = 40mm
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS and FOS is very low
OOS lmk what you think
OOS so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
OOS Are you currently changing values?
OOS pistom-pin designer says increase the diameter
OOS ok I have mass: 3.05, FOS 2.02
OOS no clue
OOS what about thickness of flywheel?
OOS They are t_I and r_1.
OOS Great Work
OOS Can you do that? Right now its at 50
OOS What is your mass?
OOS ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
OOS group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
OOS Need anything from me?
OOS Have you broadcasted your most recent design?
OOS ya, seems like we have agreement on that
OOS We need to have the heavy parts drop mass
OOS 4706
OOS what variables do you control?
OOS Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
OOS I've kept my numbers steady for a while
OOS It just updated
OOS someone is changing stuff
OOS yo we got excellent
OOS mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
OOS Crankshaft asked for bore diameter. Thats all
OOS exactly
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS With my current design, mass is 0.52 and Fs is 2.0
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS are all the values you get assuming you maximize the variables out of your control?
OOS my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
OOS group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
OOS dont change it theyre changing it back
OOS ok i did
OOS the c and dc i currently have yields best fos which is 2.283 but it's not the lightest
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS sitting at 2.77
OOS Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
OOS all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
OOS MASS: 25.95, FOS 2.27
OOS Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
OOS one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
OOS okay
OOS 2.31
OOS (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
OOS For sure.
OOS so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down
OOS cool, let us know if we should change the bore diameter
OOS Factor of safety is 5000??
OOS Aim for FOS to be above 2 while minimizing mass
OOS We need an FS of 1.5
OOS Has yours updated yet?
OOS What do your fos numbers look like?
OOS the piston wont respond to me
OOS Okay. We're probably at the best we can do. Will talk to other designerd.
OOS Ok
OOS i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
OOS ours just does donuts as of rn
OOS Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
OOS yes
OOS Did you just change something?
OOS dont move
OOS flywheel is 0.52 currently
OOS tandy
OOS Keep your FOS above 2
OOS My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
OOS ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
OOS I think you and I have the most influence over total mass. What is your current mass and FOS?
OOS What's the FOS of your current selection? I'm trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over FOS
OOS Do you need any information from me?
OOS okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
OOS Which FS are you broadcasting
OOS im at 2.36 for fos
OOS Are you broadcasting 2.77
OOS Are you ending the experiment
OOS but stil m=3.48
OOS i made my connector rod to crank length ratio 4
OOS What do you need from me?
OOS does a larger diameter increase your mass? or decrease it?
OOS group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
OOS mine is 1.48
OOS who moved we are at poor now
OOS try 51  for t and 50 for ds
OOS i  believe at least one member's part is too heavy
OOS thats great, im at 0.1,2.62
OOS Ok, I will try that now
OOS DONT CHANGE
OOS that wasnt me
OOS nice
OOS Connecting rod says they are at FOS = 2.77
OOS what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
OOS We need just a hair less mass
OOS what flywheel factors affect the bearing offset? as in changing the flywheel thickness/diameter?
OOS All my sims seem to have it at 40 rn
OOS any ideas to get bumped up
OOS do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
OOS 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
OOS what variable do you control?
OOS If you make it bigger, mass goes up and fos as well?
OOS awesome fos
OOS your variables affect the other measurements
OOS _|_|o
OOS can you try broadcasting it since we are over 12 kg
OOS So is there any tradeoff at all?
OOS ok i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS we are at very good right now
OOS Now Im at good. weights a bit high but FOS is right on
OOS to 15
OOS if you lower D I can raise the FOS with ds
OOS woof woof
OOS group: who's next?
OOS What are your design variables?
OOS Hello, what variables do you have control over?
OOS true. what's your mass?
OOS pass it on
OOS But weight is 25
OOS maybe we need to be secret
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS oops sorry for the repeat
OOS ok
OOS No
OOS im at 60
OOS mass 27.44
OOS crankshaft weighs the most i think
OOS what is your fos?
OOS why?
OOS yeah
OOS higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
OOS what are your mass/fos
OOS Hey, I need to know what PISTON BORE DIAMETER you are planning to use for my calculations
OOS I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
OOS mm
OOS Hey so what changes have you made so far to the piston design?
OOS what range of fos #s are you getting? mine are in the hundreds so it's not the limiting system
OOS Are you broadcasting that?
OOS My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
OOS have you figure out how D effects ur numbers
OOS hi, what are your working on?
OOS you can go
OOS trying to max fos and min weight
OOS Cause we're still really high on weight
OOS ?
OOS I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter, do those affect yours?
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS ok
OOS D isn't controlled by me
OOS 2.06 right
OOS great job
OOS 2.04, no bene
OOS we are at very good
OOS Smaller diameter is better for me
OOS I just changed my FOS to 3.78 but a higher mass. That's the closest I have to 2.09
OOS it would increase my fos some
OOS niceee haha
OOS bottom
OOS We were at excellent and now poor, did you change anything?
OOS so lmk if it stays at 150
OOS for the last simulation it is 43
OOS its t_h = 4 and D = 75
OOS i  depennd on C
OOS oh right
OOS I'm using a crank pin diameter of 15 at the moment, in case you needed that value
OOS we need to decrease the mass
OOS thanks!! you too!
OOS *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
OOS So far, the 90mm looked better than the 97.5mm
OOS He wont respond lol
OOS what's your fos
OOS The bearing support off set that is ideal for me is 40
OOS Thats great
OOS We've got a "Good" engine
OOS I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
OOS Okay I'll let you know what I get
OOS getting close
OOS What is your primary goal in this simulation?
OOS My mass is 1.12, Fos is 4707
OOS do you need r2 or r3?
OOS also what are your ds and tf values
OOS I also have a second parameter that increases fos and mass if I increase that
OOS group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
OOS what is your fos? can you reduce your mass at all while staying above fos=2.1
OOS how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
OOS can get 2.62 fos with .01 extra mass
OOS hello
OOS Ok, just making sure, thanks
OOS Oh I did not receive that update, I'll try my numbers at 40 
OOS you have one that works well for you?
OOS we are back to very good now too
OOS The length of the crankshaft
OOS So I think lower D is better
OOS yeah i optimized mine as much as ic an
OOS 47.5
OOS In D = 75?
OOS sup
OOS well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
OOS it is at 150
OOS can you reduce mass but keep FOS above 2?
OOS i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
OOS thickness = 8
OOS yes, 75 works for me and piston
OOS m= 3.46 fos=0.3
OOS i don't think either of those affect me
OOS yo, what is your FOS?
OOS I change it back to 80 since the overall results for 75 are not good
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS no
OOS because my part weighs so little, ill just focus on the fos
OOS tf = 22 and ds = 49
OOS Crankshaft is at 1.49 for m
OOS What's your mass rn?
OOS really?
OOS I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
OOS You good to leave
OOS and mass?
OOS By how much would be good for you?
OOS its as small as itll go
OOS whats your current FOS
OOS No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
OOS hello
OOS you next?
OOS the highest fos rn for me is 0.89
OOS now it's back ?? idk
OOS Nope
OOS what's your factor of safety currently
OOS Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
OOS crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter, so I used 70mm
OOS Made diameter 75
OOS okay, what's your weight?
OOS Flywheel isn't communicating thats the problem
OOS Yes, I just figured out how to use the software. Let me check it out
OOS cant decrease it anymore, its at 40
OOS we need to do better though lol
OOS Try broadcasting 80
OOS Working with you and piston as well
OOS *what values is everyone in control of
OOS Do you know how C affects your FoS
OOS Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
OOS what is the mass of your system?
OOS im so confused what happened
OOS nah i dont think that would change the varialbes for me
OOS What does it look like for you?
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS ok ill see
OOS Someone picked an FS of 0.51
OOS 2.08
OOS hmmm okay
OOS Okay
OOS okay sweet
OOS O|X|X
OOS Our mass keeps going up
OOS my part doesnt effect mass very much
OOS Hi
OOS I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
OOS Piston bore diameter
OOS 2.01
OOS yeah nope
OOS Same happened to me a bit ago
OOS Do you understand how it al fits together. I feel like we all only see that small snapshot of our component
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS K, lowest I can make my weight with FOS>2 is 5.42 which is a big improvement
OOS i havent changed
OOS 2.31 to 25.99
OOS ok dont do that
OOS what is your current mass?
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS sweet
OOS I have found a piston bore diameter of around 90 to be best for me
OOS ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
OOS hmm ok I'll check around
OOS 4.55 which is my highest
OOS What info do you have?
OOS my masss is 6.28
OOS cool
OOS Any luck?
OOS Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
OOS i have 1.7 fos with 58 mass
OOS I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually. So we cannot optimize that part.
OOS Do you still have your diameter at maximum?
OOS my part minimized the mass while keeping FOS>2, will keep updating it
OOS hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod. my variables are l1 (length of the pin), and the inner and outer diameter of the pin (di, d0)
OOS Where do you even see that? My global quality shows poor
OOS LOL NO
OOS We're done
OOS I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
OOS you mean the global variables? the FOS is 0.57 right now
OOS What happens when you decrease piston diameter?
OOS 3.2, but that's about to decrease since my mass is way too high
OOS make sure you update the global broadcast
OOS and t_H
OOS 1.67
OOS Hey!
OOS Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
OOS even with max c i still have fos = 300
OOS and our mass so high
OOS or it
OOS I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
OOS I think tyhe 47.5 produced better results
OOS the only person changing values is the flywheel
OOS Hello, is your FOS above 1.5?
OOS Dont change your values from when we had the high score
OOS yeah shes definitely like one of the best lecturers in ME
OOS Its at very good
OOS Okay. I played around with it at the beginning and I don't think my FOS has a huge affect on the overall FOS. My mass is only 3.17, and my FOS is at 2. That's where I thought I would keep it for now.
OOS design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
OOS Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
OOS (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
OOS yes do that
OOS Have you messaged the others about this yet?
OOS ok.  whats the plan stan?
OOS do you control piston bore diameter?
OOS Just broadcasted it. I chose 55 for D
OOS I MEAN INCREASE
OOS I am thanks for letting me know!
OOS try using 50 mm
OOS Ok
OOS 1.31
OOS our weight is too high
OOS i can also cut weight but it will reduce FOS
OOS nope! do you need info from me?
OOS Mass is at a min. FOS is still about 4700
OOS The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
OOS ok sounds good
OOS Hi
OOS Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
OOS i meant for your individual part
OOS wait
OOS D = 75
OOS something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
OOS dont move
OOS hello
OOS so increase FOS for one component now?
OOS FS optimization would be best. Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low FS
OOS ok
OOS Piston diameter and thickness
OOS what are you currently using for D?
OOS for subsytsem
OOS i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
OOS any way you can reduce mass?
OOS what i was told
OOS Have you broadcasted anything recently?
OOS We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
OOS Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
OOS let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS I think were at safe right now
OOS ill try
OOS Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
OOS The piston pin length, and the inner and outer diameter of the of the piston pin 
OOS are you still using A D=40?
OOS 18.63
OOS We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
OOS but i backed you up
OOS idk what changed but quality just dropped
OOS yes both do
OOS i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
OOS right now at 88 shows very good
OOS what are the values you put
OOS can you share all your variables
OOS is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS Do you have an estimate to what diameter you want for the piston bore?
OOS Keep it steady we got excellent
OOS ok how much can you decrease mass before below 2?
OOS hahahahaa
OOS I agree, I also can change the Piston head thickness.
OOS Whats your lowest mass?
OOS okay nice
OOS Nope, only need one thing from the piston
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
OOS 2.01 still
OOS It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
OOS gives excellent
OOS what about now?
OOS Are you referring to  the piston bore diameter?
OOS does urs go straight
OOS the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass
OOS Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
OOS That sounds ideal to me
OOS Yeah thats because our parts are heavy
OOS I didn;t change
OOS wait we're at very good
OOS I can broadcast htat
OOS yes, one minute on that
OOS it drops the FOS
OOS let me change around and see what i got
OOS group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
OOS okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
OOS are we all selected?
OOS that fos is good since your part is pretty small
OOS at least it's the largest part in the system lol\
OOS acceptable weight now
OOS mines at 3
OOS okay we have very good again
OOS got it, hmmm
OOS Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
OOS I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
OOS Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
OOS Same
OOS And a thickness of 12?
OOS Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
OOS d back to 10 now because fos is high
OOS okay
OOS I don't think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from 40 to 70
OOS its the smallest I can go
OOS nope!
OOS My simulation would be excellent, the broadcast was very good and now poor?
OOS Hello piston, based on my information, it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness (tf) and maximize flywheel shaft diameter (ds). Does this work with your design requirements?
OOS Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
OOS hahaha
OOS Mine neither
OOS can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
OOS Yeah I am happy with this gg
OOS piston have control over diameter as well, I need the diameter for my variables
OOS I'm not sure what happened, but if you need me to change anything, let me know. From here all I can do is increase FOS and mass, but we don't need that
OOS try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
OOS 60mm
OOS so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
OOS i am at my lowest
OOS did it affect the overall?
OOS Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
OOS and thickness is 7.5
OOS DONT MOVE
OOS Nice!
OOS I think we are good
OOS i see that
OOS ok
OOS connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
OOS What did you choose your diameter to be?
OOS ok still at 60
OOS What is your current FOS?
OOS That would be my guess too.
OOS I already got paid haha, although they said if you keep improving it we can get more even afterwars
OOS Let me know if I can adjust my variables to better suite your requirements
OOS does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
OOS I m trying to pick a middle value
OOS hello
OOS kk
OOS Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
OOS so keep playing with your parameters and ill let you know how it impacts me
OOS Group: I will decrease mine now
OOS Hey did you see message from flywheel?
OOS right now it's 11.09
OOS Which part do you think has the most mass? mine is small but i can chang FOS a lot
OOS yeah
OOS Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen
OOS How does flywheel shaft diameter and thickness affect your mass?
OOS I think were good. We are at the highest point we can be. Good job!
OOS great
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
OOS what is your FOS?
OOS do*
OOS Crankshaft@1.08 kg
OOS Do you have any dependencies with others measurements that could help your values?
OOS yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good
OOS change what to what?\
OOS ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
OOS I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs > 2 design.
OOS mine is at 1.45 now
OOS I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used
OOS do you have the piston bore diameter
OOS I haven't broadcasted yet ho
OOS Her, how are your masses and FS looking?
OOS What about you?
OOS whats your weight at?
OOS Should have gone through? C= 150, dc=50
OOS i dont think i have that as an input. Unless im missing something.
OOS I cant get a response tho
OOS ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples FOS
OOS values are at a minimum for me
OOS Also, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
OOS 0.55
OOS increasing c increases mass
OOS ?
OOS What are you working on?
OOS arent lining up
OOS Can you decrease c to 60 and see what you get?
OOS I asked the other designers and the fos seems to be fine
OOS Do you have any idea about the D value?
OOS okay i ust put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
OOS ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
OOS changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
OOS can you please share your variables with just the letters
OOS undo what you did
OOS 20 questions
OOS Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
OOS Hey, I just wanted to ask if you needed anything from me
OOS how about FOS?
OOS I still see 40
OOS what's yours?
OOS what's your mass>
OOS what is your fos?
OOS Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
OOS what's your mass
OOS 11.09
OOS Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value
OOS GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
OOS im at 2.36
OOS Ok
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS idk if it helps mass though. does it?
OOS alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past 1.23 FOS
OOS Can you set the piston bore diameter to 85 and get a good fos?
OOS 1.8 to 4.72, I'm currently at 2.14 but can drop to 1.96 without loosing too much fos
OOS ok back to very good i say leabe it
OOS ?
OOS increasing D gives me a worse weight
OOS try changing your other values?
OOS we got excellent
OOS piston guy controls it
OOS how does diameter affect your part?
OOS The highest performance is at 3.91 FOS and 5.2M
OOS I think we are done
OOS no worries
OOS whoever changed it change back
OOS group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
OOS update back to very good
OOS sounds good
OOS sure
OOS ok
OOS I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
OOS Any way to increase FOS?
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS Good
OOS yeah agreed
OOS nevermind, back at excellent now.
OOS mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
OOS and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
OOS If you need to increase up to 42 thats possible
OOS lol
OOS piston mass is currently 0.83
OOS we are at "Good" now
OOS does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
OOS 2.36
OOS flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
OOS the one that is currently broadcasted is 6.92. Thats the max i can get
OOS Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
OOS yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
OOS okay
OOS did you change something?
OOS that makes sense
OOS Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
OOS FOS is good. Mass is 10kg too high
OOS What would you like?
OOS Flywheel guy is also in on it
OOS FOS is back i increased thickness
OOS im not sure if everyone is on board.
OOS 2
OOS so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your FOS
OOS okay we might need to increase your
OOS the broadcasted values of 2.31 and 1.4
OOS yeah i cant change anything. We done?
OOS Increasing that will allow my factor of safety to increase. Any reason we're keeping it low?
OOS however i can bring it all the way down to 40 and still have a fos of 2.7
OOS minimize it if you can while keeping fos as close to 2 as possible
OOS I need to change D to 85 though
OOS if we can do that it cuts my mass to 1.24
OOS its fine now
OOS I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod lenth and the crank lenth
OOS Can I have a current value of D
OOS can you get that FOS up?
OOS For just the flywheel?
OOS increasing your the bearing offset only reduces the FOS so im keeping it at 150
OOS great, done then
OOS 45
OOS what mass are you using?
OOS oh okay, sounds good
OOS Yeah really
OOS has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
OOS Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
OOS are you broadcasting new values?
OOS yeah one sec
OOS Im using .8 and .55 for r2 and r3
OOS same sounds good
OOS 5.75 @ 75
OOS we can optimize c and tf looks like
OOS you said piston diameter is in your equation right?
OOS unless you change that at all?
OOS *of mass
OOS I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
OOS Right now I'm using D = 85
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS thickness = 10
OOS 3.62
OOS My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
OOS i updated
OOS same and im currently there
OOS what is your fos now?
OOS mine are piston diameter and head thickness
OOS we did hit both requirements at one point
OOS We have some wiggle room in our mass now, I can try adjusting my thicknesses and see if that helps 
OOS looks like mass dropped a lot
OOS ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
OOS f_os = 9193.31
OOS 0.28
OOS Sorry 60
OOS dang that fos is low
OOS thanks!
OOS Hey
OOS My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
OOS We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
OOS ?
OOS You?
OOS Ok cool
OOS piston is0.91
OOS hmm
OOS I think my part and yours are doing fine
OOS what diam are you using
OOS what really?
OOS i have control over neither, only c and dc
OOS sweet!
OOS As of right now, I'm comfortable around 85 for my diameter, but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass
OOS right now my mass is at .69 and my FS is 3.84
OOS so raising c increases mass and reduces fos
OOS I'm thinking larger D makes my part heavier
OOS we need it to be higher than 2
OOS wait what
OOS so connector rod is 600
OOS can you change it to 150?
OOS DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
OOS Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
OOS ok
OOS great, done then
OOS good work
OOS how much does your fos increase though? because then we could save mass in other parts
OOS 2.83
OOS I'm at fair quality. FOS is a bit low, total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though
OOS Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
OOS Ok thanks
OOS Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
OOS New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
OOS we are at very good again as of 12;53
OOS with my current dimensions mass is 1.2 and FOS is 15886.04
OOS Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS I am at the time we got the best result now
OOS do it
OOS i can decrease diameter
OOS Lowest FOS is the system FOS
OOS i can decrase on the weight but the FOS wouldn't meet requirement
OOS how much mass is your part?
OOS so close
OOS we reached good
OOS yea
OOS How does changing D affect your FOS?
OOS ok
OOS I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
OOS What are your mass and FOS?
OOS We need to save weight
OOS yea
OOS mine is 0.14 which is highest for my lowest mass option
OOS It is
OOS haha yea fingers crossed it stays at very good
OOS ok with the results
OOS could yo slightly lower your diamter again?
OOS I decreased my weight parameter a bit
OOS we only need it to be above 2
OOS try that
OOS and t_h, which may be the length
OOS I can change diameter if needed
OOS message back when you did it
OOS what mass do you have for the flywheel?
OOS Sorry, t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length.
OOS depends
OOS mine are piston diameter and head thickness
OOS What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
OOS But it's back to poor now again
OOS check for broadcast
OOS though I might switch to 75
OOS Who is this?
OOS just kidding, back to poor. 
OOS okay, you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger
OOS I reduced mine to the lowest value, and our FOS is good now
OOS go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
OOS yay
OOS we got it, don't change things
OOS Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
OOS 7X7 fun
OOS done
OOS very close now
OOS why isnt this exxcellent
OOS below 45 weight and above 2 fos for auto engine design
OOS did you  broadcast your value?
OOS yeah we were over 2 about a minute ago
OOS i didnt touvch anything
OOS yes.  i think so
OOS WHO THE HELL KEEPS MOVING IT TO POOR
OOS not me
OOS group: who wants to go next?
OOS Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
OOS _|_|O
OOS i haven't changed anything
OOS reply when done
OOS What is your range for diameter?
OOS 2.42
OOS lets just try getting our mass down
OOS cool
OOS I'll check in with you on that in a sec
OOS they don't wanna give us 20 bucks
OOS piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
OOS r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
OOS We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
OOS piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
OOS PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
OOS okay, what mass are you at!
OOS hello
OOS did I?
OOS mass is .13 and fos is 3.1
OOS I got fos 2.36
OOS are your masses high
OOS Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with?
OOS Who changed?
OOS anyways ya ive given up on 375 but imma hang out in Hess's office starting next week
OOS Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS but the far right column is the projected values for them and I think the ideal broadcast is the one with the best projected values
OOS and we are just trying to optimize somehow?
OOS i didnt change
OOS I'm trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass
OOS Yeah
OOS variable that affects my mass and fos is just diameter, so I've been minimizing my "outputs" on that diameter
OOS all good
OOS i think so, I think i just figured out what i need to do. I was confused at first
OOS what is your ms?
OOS we havent added it yet
OOS What is the lower limit of your weight range?
OOS *meant, I apologize
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS bearing offset
OOS How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
OOS what is your current diameter size
OOS The greater the values for either of those, the greater the FOS and mass
OOS Cool
OOS Can you see if you increase your bore diamater to 41 or 42 if it improves anything?
OOS it does increase my FOS
OOS before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
OOS I see it
OOS 2.01
OOS 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
OOS *what values is everyone in control of
OOS I do the control ds but its the same
OOS were in good range rn
OOS Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
OOS does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
OOS my turn
OOS Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
OOS I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
OOS What's a good working piston bore diameter?
OOS Group- only piston engineer edits
OOS New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
OOS i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
OOS Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
OOS nevermind I'm being stupid
OOS (To all): ok with results
OOS Yes, with that my FOS is now 2.17
OOS DONT CHANGE
OOS diamater is 90
OOS that's big
OOS *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
OOS yes, they are active
OOS or is it each case by case for each part ?
OOS Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
OOS I can get mine up to 3.44 max where D = 40
OOS y'all we need to get the FS to 2
OOS What is your FOS?
OOS We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
OOS we finished now?
OOS and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
OOS i changed to excellent
OOS currenty 2.03, but that can be raised.
OOS I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
OOS so that seems too big
OOS check what you have now, piston changed 
OOS its 2700
OOS thats bonkers
OOS I think that will be the crankshaft!
OOS When you broadcast, does that just update the overall model with the design you selected for your subsystem?
OOS Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
OOS i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS alright
OOS my mass is minimized
OOS Just D
OOS ill try decreasing my mass slightly
OOS im not sure
OOS X X O ; _ O _ ; _ O _
OOS cZ i was gonna try 80
OOS the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
OOS Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
OOS nope
OOS So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
OOS lets try that
OOS how did the mass go up
OOS My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
OOS No at most ill change it by 10, how much would a diameter of 50 affect your mass and FOS
OOS Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
OOS before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
OOS q1: is it smaller than a microwave?
OOS i have set it to those values
OOS 20.86
OOS how's your FOS looking
OOS what's the diameter you're using?
OOS ?
OOS I could try
OOS Change it back to a run with a FoS greater than 2
OOS we just bumped up top fair
OOS group-piston pin now
OOS nope!
OOS I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
OOS Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
OOS or reduced offset i should say
OOS I see 2.73
OOS Mass is now 0.1
OOS great, thanks!
OOS I think both of us are good
OOS :)
OOS Our mass just increased a lot
OOS I haven't touched anything for a while
OOS Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
OOS okay cool everyone responded
OOS What is the current value of the bore?
OOS since we are at the threshold for fs
OOS wont let me
OOS Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness?
OOS good?
OOS is*
OOS I believe FOS of 2.31
OOS No, do you need anything from me?
OOS so let's lower our weight first
OOS yeah
OOS yes, piston bore is 80
OOS i know
OOS I am working on setting the thickness of the I section of the connecting rod and the Conrod length to crank length ratio. What about you?
OOS Right. Got mine to mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
OOS basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
OOS Okay
OOS I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter, I got these values by setting D = 45 
OOS I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
OOS What is your current mass at?
OOS crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
OOS Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important
OOS then it was not me
OOS I didnt
OOS Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
OOS mas is up pretty high
OOS Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
OOS i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
OOS nah
OOS Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
OOS If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our FOS
OOS Piston pin too
OOS okay we got excellent. we should be done here
OOS It's the same tradeoff for everyone
OOS whats it to u
OOS aight
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS Its at 2.83 rn for me
OOS Nope things changed to the worst now
OOS thanks
OOS Need to increase FOS
OOS was that you?
OOS the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
OOS you?
OOS FOS = 2, M = 6.72
OOS Alright, thank you. That is the highest FOS I have found
OOS not me
OOS fos_s: 1653.92;
OOS 43 or lower for fos greater than 2
OOS i think this is a trap
OOS i broadcasted my best
OOS Our FOS was at like 2.5 and mass was at 44. Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton.
OOS How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
OOS Will experiment
OOS What is your D?
OOS let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS I control the diameter of the piston head and the thickness of the piston head
OOS actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
OOS hey, Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be 10 mm, is this what you got?
OOS also reducing c significantly reduces the FOS
OOS How does the bearing support offset affect your part?
OOS Alright.
OOS no 25 is the highest it goes...
OOS (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
OOS Is higher or lower D better for you?
OOS at a bore diameter of 45 i don't think there's anything I can do. I'm going to play around with bore diameter to see if that helps
OOS yall stay at where you are
OOS Yea our dimensions line up then
OOS 7.4
OOS pistons mass is 0.52 with a fos of 2.01
OOS :(
OOS need: piston bore diamter
OOS The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
OOS ok
OOS I haven't it increases mass and decreases FOS so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn't make sense on my end
OOS no one change anything
OOS we're at excellent
OOS we at very good rn im happy with that
OOS I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
OOS no lol
OOS no
OOS Not sure. I didn't change anything. I let all the others know
OOS I've got 2 of my own variables
OOS thats the pistonpin i think. rn i have piston diameter of 90
OOS D = 90
OOS your individual mass?
OOS We're close, guys
OOS What do you mean? 0.52 is my minimum mass
OOS get you factor of safety as close to 2
OOS make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
OOS its as low as itll go
OOS Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
OOS What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
OOS Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
OOS whats your fos at for current settings
OOS it says excellent for me
OOS Mine are flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
OOS Thanks, I'm good on my end. Is there anything you need from my end?
OOS It's all good now. Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS >2 ?
OOS I am simply sitting here
OOS dc at 45
OOS Not sure where the mass increase came from
OOS what is the mass of your system?
OOS Is 40 the best value you have found for D
OOS also just realized that you and i are gonna have to figure out the quiz alone bc anisah left
OOS awesome
OOS Go fast theyre giving out the money
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
OOS What factors are you interested in?
OOS m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
OOS Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
OOS yes, let's do one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
OOS Can you send me your mass?
OOS my mass is minimized rn
OOS I change it to 80 now
OOS Great - let me know if you need anything from me
OOS just remember what you have now
OOS did any mass values change?
OOS hey i think that made things better!
OOS Thanks for checking in but I am all set in terms of needed values. Is there anything on my end I should send over?
OOS or we were for a second
OOS for mass?
OOS Don't change anything
OOS we have time
OOS make sure to reduce weight and keep fos at 2
OOS and see
OOS can you try increasing ds?
OOS do you think lower diameter will give you a higher fos?
OOS do you know what's going on?
OOS Yeah the piston bore
OOS so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high FOS
OOS I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
OOS We're done
OOS I didn't change anything, still at c=150 and dc=45
OOS ok yeah so really small. I was just wondering why mass was so high
OOS its piston pin designer
OOS i just clicked broadcast
OOS yeah it sucked
OOS Are you changing youre values?
OOS and Thickness of the flywheel
OOS I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
OOS our factor of safety went down
OOS tf = 12
OOS what values are you at
OOS we're good now
OOS ggs
OOS I put mine to initial values and the FOS is good now
OOS 85 seems good for now, testing my own combinations
OOS min weight : 0.5kg, max weight : 1.61 kg
OOS We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
OOS actually we should be getting excellent
OOS nope, haven't broadcasted in a bit. The most I can change the wieght is by like 3 anyways
OOS i'm asking around rn
OOS so close
OOS Oh ok mine just updated
OOS Hi! I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me
OOS heloooo
OOS Looks good. I am at 2.03 and 0.05 = m
OOS can you increase it to around 2 or 3
OOS I mean, its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads. So that's normal.
OOS okay one sec
OOS if I change it to 75, will it affect your design
OOS just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
OOS I'm good, thanks
OOS You have a lot of parameters to change, so try and run as many simulations as possible to try and find the sweet spot of mass and FOS
OOS do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
OOS yeah. i dont think i can change diameter because it will affect everyone
OOS who got very good and broadcast those values
OOS no
OOS whats the name of the diameter?
OOS thickness is 10
OOS this looks like some weird morse code
OOS sorry
OOS Did you change anything?
OOS yep
OOS one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
OOS Alright, I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design, so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens
OOS nah its above 35
OOS LOWER YOUR FOS
OOS We need to meet at least one of these criteria
OOS I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
OOS hello
OOS But my mass is like 0.9
OOS I think there is but I don't know how.
OOS Yep just got paid
OOS great!!
OOS Hi :)
OOS Do what you need to do to get FoS > 1.5 and then we can adjust masses from there
OOS At max FOS
OOS I broadcasted something but then i changed it now
OOS Ok now it dropped
OOS Sounds great to me
OOS Yeah, I'm upto 2.62 now. But remember, its the minimum of all the FOS that matters the most.
OOS mine is showing as poor right now
OOS ?
OOS let me know what the new diameter is
OOS I think we can keep going
OOS Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
OOS 1.2
OOS no
OOS We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
OOS just wait it out
OOS 0.57
OOS Okay
OOS We need to reduce mass if possible
OOS on my screen it says quality is excellent
OOS D = 90
OOS I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
OOS what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
OOS are you making any changes  ?
OOS i will stick with 47
OOS Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
OOS Great
OOS same
OOS try to find a combo that gets you just above 2 fos but the lowest mass
OOS i didnt change anything
OOS OK
OOS I changed fos but not the diamter
OOS Yeah I've taken that as low as possible without completely ruining fos, we also need to raise that
OOS mine's still showing 80
OOS 1.62 kg
OOS They asked and I gave them 40mm. I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them, and they have not responded
OOS agreed
OOS If I increase the Piston Diameter, how much will it affect your FOS
OOS agreed
OOS yea our values are horrible
OOS a little someone else is messing around with their fos
OOS yeah that makes sense
OOS try 41.25 for t_f and 45 for diameter
OOS 15886.04
OOS Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
OOS you good if we start with a smaller bore diameter of 45? if that doesn't work we can increase it
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS Quality very good Nice!
OOS HEllo
OOS hello?
OOS reduced to 150
OOS I have around 10
OOS it got worse so i would change it back
OOS My sheet says piston bore diameter but it's not a variable that I control.
OOS I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
OOS Like now
OOS What bore diameter are you choosing?
OOS Yeah we just need mass to go down
OOS crankshaft is 2.11 but they say they cant decrease it anymore
OOS they said they didnt change it
OOS Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
OOS yeet
OOS Currently I think the mass is too much.
OOS at some point. need to get mass down
OOS good
OOS let me check real quick
OOS some one got good quality what where your variables in that
OOS what is your fos?
OOS i waaaaaant mooooney
OOS Wait are we using D = 85 or 75?
OOS mas- 1.23 fos- 12.2k
OOS report weight
OOS what are your values currently at?
OOS for mass
OOS It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same, but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but fos is reduced
OOS What is the piston bore diameter?
OOS we are at fair
OOS GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
OOS Global requirements top of page
OOS _I_I_
OOS all good
OOS Thats great, let's see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
OOS I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
OOS What testbed variables do you have?
OOS What piston bore diameter are you using?
OOS ya, try 75
OOS Hold where you are
OOS I think you could decrease mass bc FOS only needs to be above 2
OOS can you reduce is closer to 2 while decreasing mass?
OOS ?
OOS shoot
OOS m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
OOS see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
OOS Ah I see
OOS OK STOP
OOS Well I think each individual part needs a FOS greater than 2
OOS That's pretty minimal
OOS overall fos is decreawseing
OOS i didnt
OOS No
OOS my lowest fos is 1.46, max is 31.19
OOS completely
OOS I am at about 0.11
OOS okay sounds good
OOS im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
OOS Hi
OOS this is what i ahve rn
OOS also which FS are you broadcasting
OOS piston told me
OOS whats your fos now?
OOS I don't think it's piston
OOS I will change to 70
OOS (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
OOS (To all): ok with results
OOS that was with r2 at .5, r3 at.7 and D at 40
OOS dont change anything hahah
OOS We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
OOS what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
OOS no we should go for excellent
OOS group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
OOS going with the minimum to reduce mass because my FOS is so high
OOS same
OOS piston pin has ds
OOS is bore diameter piston diameter
OOS It is updated. That's my current broadcast.
OOS ill ask
OOS okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
OOS for my part or the whole thing?
OOS we are at excellent again
OOS 150
OOS group-flywheel now
OOS What about you
OOS dont change anything
OOS What were the values?
OOS I can adjust thickness to have a required FOS at a specific D
OOS for both fos and mass?
OOS Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
OOS Hey looks like our FOS went up. What changed?
OOS What are you broadcasting?
OOS what can we do to increase your FOS?
OOS my FOS is best at 40, making it larger decreases my FOS
OOS Piston bore diamteter
OOS Idk if we have certain rounds or not
OOS nice
OOS 2.77
OOS Currently 3.2
OOS 150
OOS We had a very good one at 80 before
OOS yes
OOS Ok 60 is my lowest possible so I'll leave it at that
OOS Okay
OOS No
OOS Global quality looking bad though
OOS What is your current mass?
OOS Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin?
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS thats as low as I have gotten it
OOS I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
OOS What variables/equations do you deal with?
OOS can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
OOS Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
OOS what is your current ds
OOS bore diameter
OOS I'm ending it
OOS we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
OOS should we try 85 for dia?
OOS me too
OOS I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
OOS what is your fos?
OOS OK
OOS its actually at the minimum
OOS thanks
OOS gotcha, try 85 then
OOS yup. will do ;(
OOS Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass
OOS #ERROR!
OOS Do you need anything from me?
OOS ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
OOS I think that doing that effects the other designs as well
OOS Hi
OOS Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design.
OOS i think so
OOS ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
OOS tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
OOS mine is 29
OOS D = 80 not 90
OOS good job team
OOS Whats your fos?
OOS I think a tf value of 10 is best
OOS now we are at very good
OOS Didn't change anything. We need to decrease mass
OOS tf increases mass...
OOS wait, can you reduce the mass
OOS For better or worse. want me to change mine and see how it affects yours real quick
OOS alright, guess not then
OOS sure!, I'm trying to play with c to get a higher FOS
OOS We need just a hair less mass
OOS Group: no more changes!
OOS i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
OOS so for me besides diameter, i can play around with two variables
OOS Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
OOS yes
OOS nice work
OOS It should be our lowest FS, but it's 0.51 instead of 2
OOS Yes that is what I have input
OOS Yea. I am working with my numbers to try and fix that.
OOS flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
OOS try not to change anything until you talk to someone
OOS what's your current piston bore diameter?
OOS hi
OOS m=0.07 FOS=1.23
OOS If you need the offset to be higher let me know.
OOS Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
OOS Sorry, I think my mass is 1.5
OOS Sorry for the abrupt message. I saw that we got excellent and didn't want to lose it
OOS i mistyped D = 80
OOS ok cause I have lowest fos so ill fail first meaning overall fos depends on me
OOS increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS 1.3 kg so not really
OOS I'll be on it
OOS ok will try some other variations
OOS GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
OOS that massive dip did not come from piston
OOS alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
OOS yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
OOS Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
OOS my value has been the same as well thanks for the update
OOS We've got a "Good" engine
OOS Let me know if you change the bearing offset
OOS hello?
OOS sweet, ill update my FOS
OOS ok youre the minimum
OOS actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
OOS impressive
OOS Check for broadcast now
OOS Ok great
OOS Ok
OOS what is your diameter at currently?
OOS good working with ya
OOS What do you currently have for your bore diameter?
OOS I'm fine with that
OOS can you share your variable letters (what you control and what you need)
OOS If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit
OOS who's fos changed
OOS 3.64
OOS We need to increase fos
OOS c and dc
OOS hey, just wondering, what are your inputs? 
OOS Rod designer still here
OOS oh for sure
OOS cool
OOS We did
OOS the $20 we just won
OOS howeffect on mass
OOS ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve fos some with other parts
OOS bueno
OOS our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me, can you try and get them to talk to me :( I need to discuss values with them
OOS one sec
OOS tell me if it's better to use greater value because 40mm is the minimum value
OOS whats the corresponding fos?
OOS group - same with piston-pin
OOS I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on FOS
OOS Is there anything you can do to reduce mass without changing fos much?
OOS No
OOS 2.01
OOS record your current value
OOS do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
OOS Yes
OOS Is there a way to lower that? Mass is way too high and FOS too low
OOS Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
OOS Where is your FOS at?
OOS I just got my FOS up to 9
OOS we got excellent
OOS perfect
OOS yep, we need to lower the overall mass
OOS to simulate
OOS what is your current FOS?
OOS lets leave it like this
OOS has the bore diameter updated?
OOS _IXI_
OOS _IXI_
OOS Perfect
OOS ok sounds good
OOS do you rely on a c or a dc?
OOS group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
OOS U mean 0.672?
OOS Maybe. not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up
OOS 2.85
OOS I have an fos of 1.45 now, I'll try increasing the diameter
OOS If i increase diameter we go over weight. Still on lowest setting
OOS Let's not change whatever we have
OOS No, I believe my variables are independent of shaft diameter
OOS Whichever works best for you
OOS just changed it to 25 d and t is 10
OOS if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
OOS Let me know what you decide
OOS yeah i have the same questionb
OOS The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
OOS it seems so, yet we are still over the mass limit?
OOS Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
OOS My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help
OOS check for a broadcast maybe?
OOS Literally, there is not
OOS with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
OOS what numbers are u running
OOS because mine still read as excellent when my diameter was at 80
OOS space
OOS sounds good
OOS Ok, try reducing the diameter to 45 and see what happens
OOS Thanks
OOS frick my mass is 57
OOS no have not plugged in any new values
OOS ok no one anything
OOS we are at excellent
OOS I know, but the weight is higher for my other options above 2
OOS Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
OOS i still have my two best broadcasted
OOS minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize fos
OOS also i forgot fos is just the minimum value not an average
OOS *your
OOS yes
OOS no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
OOS so why is our tital so low?
OOS we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
OOS im talking about your indidivudal part
OOS 0.55
OOS Mine has an FOS of 2.42
OOS idk
OOS piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
OOS 5625.56
OOS hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by .28
OOS it's corrected now
OOS It's up
OOS I haven't changed anything
OOS Don't change it!
OOS Ok cool. Do you need any values from me?
OOS Crankshaft bearing offset
OOS I didn't change
OOS group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
OOS ok run again with values when you were getting good
OOS OK STOP
OOS I'll try lowering my mass some
OOS Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
OOS Preston
OOS For D = 75 and D = 85, what are the minimum masses you can have for a FOS of 2?
OOS look at the chart on the last page of your booklet, we are shooting for the highest FOS and lowest mass
OOS decrease mass
OOS ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
OOS goal weight is actually 35
OOS Ok. Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0.
OOS r2 and r3
OOS increase it to 50
OOS not me
OOS Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
OOS Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
OOS i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
OOS I'm now at 2.77, all my numbers are at their minimum 
OOS how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
OOS 24.3 at m = .75
OOS You have to update your broadcast and look at the total FOS and mass
OOS 2.47
OOS im assuming these are horizontal
OOS what is your Fos and mass?
OOS like one part has huge FS so they just minimized mass bc the part has FS over 100 no matter what option they choose
OOS Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
OOS that's at my minimum dimensions, I can't
OOS I have thickness as 12 and diameter as 60
OOS What is ds?
OOS I'll ask them
OOS My FOS is 1.11
OOS lmaaaooooo
OOS yeet
OOS try bearing offset = 180, crankshaft pin is 35 mm
OOS my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize fos
OOS require: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
OOS do you need my rod cross section to increase?
OOS What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
OOS nope
OOS so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
OOS my masses are very small, and FS are 0.4-3.44
OOS what variable can you change  for "change variables of other sub-systems?"
OOS they just not responding to messages?
OOS don't change
OOS okay now we're better lol - idk what happened
OOS Nevermind, global changed to 55.36 and 2.03
OOS Is there any way you can reduce D?
