fine_label utterance
UNK_UNK were at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK I have not decided yet. What would help you most?
UNK_UNK according to the thing on the screen it says very good
UNK_UNK 40 inches.
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK 5.2
UNK_UNK Have you chosen a crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK how can you maximize fos and we can work around that maybe?
UNK_UNK I don't know if I can get a FOS over 1 with that diameter
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK my bad lol the range of mass is like 0 ~ 0.1 ish
UNK_UNK haven't changed anything on my ene
UNK_UNK thickness of I-section ratio of conrad length to crank length
UNK_UNK Who is the fly wheel designer ?
UNK_UNK if I reduce piston FOS overall fos goes down a lot
UNK_UNK Ok, don't think that's relevant for me
UNK_UNK what is your FOS
UNK_UNK I think you need to change your c value
UNK_UNK But that also bumped up my mass like 0.3
UNK_UNK ahh gotcha
UNK_UNK And the mass for my component is 0.55
UNK_UNK it want us talk to each other so it changes to poor sometimes
UNK_UNK go for it
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK or maybe 80
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK mines at 3.84
UNK_UNK yes, that was what I was thinking
UNK_UNK Is there a tf that works best for you?
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK my bad, thanks 
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK we can make some spare weight elsewhere
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK Hold where you are
UNK_UNK awesome! go team
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK retweet
UNK_UNK I think the other designers have way too high fos's
UNK_UNK How are we looking with FS?
UNK_UNK my mass is 0.52
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK that works for me too
UNK_UNK 2.31
UNK_UNK Does a larger thickness negatively affect fos or mass?
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK (piston head)
UNK_UNK Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
UNK_UNK what you need and what you have
UNK_UNK I didnt change anything
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK good working with ya even though we didnt get to talk much
UNK_UNK what are your ds and tf?
UNK_UNK t_f = 12.0 and d_s = 60.0
UNK_UNK no I do not think it does, I was able to get my FOS up above 3.4 though
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK flywheel says they have an FOS of 3286 apparently?
UNK_UNK Basically unless the bore diameter changes I found my sweet spot.
UNK_UNK Sorry, mass 25.69, fos 1.45
UNK_UNK Is there anything you can reduce to cut mass but keep the FOS just above 2?
UNK_UNK were good
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK What does it change for you?
UNK_UNK wonderful system, this is.
UNK_UNK If I do the lowest mass I can then FOS goes down by a lot
UNK_UNK what variables are you considering?
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK i'll look and see if there are any
UNK_UNK i haven't either
UNK_UNK my current fos is 1.35, connecting rod designedr has 7.69, what do you have?
UNK_UNK that's okay, FOS is still close to 2
UNK_UNK We once had an excellent quality though
UNK_UNK George?
UNK_UNK Ok, right now my r2 is 0.5 and r3 is 0.2. Is that what you need?
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Where exactly do i check that?
UNK_UNK I think the previous dimensions had us at a "very good"
UNK_UNK That might be worth it. Maybe tell the others you're doing that
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK How does crankshaft-pin diameter affect your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK I'm the low FOS of 2.01, can you cut any more mass out
UNK_UNK yeah min is 2.77
UNK_UNK it just said very good
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK lol ya slight L but were still hanging on
UNK_UNK we are at excellent now
UNK_UNK X X _ ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK mine is 2.09
UNK_UNK are you changing things
UNK_UNK I have it low as possible
UNK_UNK Yeah let me bump up the rod thickness
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK we need to get below 3 kg for the FOS to really matter at this point
UNK_UNK Just did max, 105!
UNK_UNK Can you try and minimize your bearing offset? I'm getting the best results for a bearing offset of 60
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK only (c) affects my Fos.  Butmy Fos is in the range of thousands so I don't think it matters too much.
UNK_UNK whats your fos
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK my part is a lot of the total weight
UNK_UNK someone changed it again
UNK_UNK q5: is it a windshield wiper
UNK_UNK Whats your current diameter?
UNK_UNK Are you changing your broadcast values a lot
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK Yeah i have the connecting rod at minimum thickness
UNK_UNK i think that will raise my FOS and lower weight
UNK_UNK kmaybe not
UNK_UNK i'm trying to minimize the mass of crankshaft and factor of safety
UNK_UNK *anyone has lower FOS change when mass dec?
UNK_UNK I have the best broadcast available for my thing
UNK_UNK my mass is 3.13 (the lowest option) and FOS is 0.58
UNK_UNK ok we are good
UNK_UNK nah dont do that
UNK_UNK My quality is at good right now, not sure if it shows the same thing for everyone  Send
UNK_UNK what piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK Yeah, I saw that. Wondering if it's the crankshaft
UNK_UNK what's your current value?
UNK_UNK 82.5 is good
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK mass 1.83 and  fos 1.92
UNK_UNK are those variables L and r?
UNK_UNK Does 2.09 affect mass significantly?
UNK_UNK What piston diameter are you using that works well?
UNK_UNK Looks like our FOS went up
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40
UNK_UNK totally unsure what 4 simulations you mean
UNK_UNK I havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK What is your piston bore diameter right now
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75 to see what happens
UNK_UNK Ok, i was just wondering if any of my parameters need to be entered into your catalog to get the correct mass and fos values
UNK_UNK new c is broadcast
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK Ok. We need to try to decrease mass
UNK_UNK We're good
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK yes but i didnt broadcast
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK *and gets called out for it*
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK but then
UNK_UNK mine is 0.1 so idk why our mass is so high
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK we got it, don't change things
UNK_UNK but I can slightly increase mass to get 2.63 FOS
UNK_UNK See if you can bump that up
UNK_UNK i think i need to change then
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK Hey what do you have control over?
UNK_UNK what's your mass and FOS
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK sounds good ill do 45
UNK_UNK hey try changing the diameter to 90
UNK_UNK are you changing the variables?
UNK_UNK and keep D lower
UNK_UNK yeah that is what im using
UNK_UNK ms:1.17 fs:2.0
UNK_UNK can you lower the r values
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK but D has alot of impact on weight so i ude thickness to improve FOS
UNK_UNK wait what did you change?
UNK_UNK Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
UNK_UNK !
UNK_UNK at 0.1
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK it requires piston bore diameter, any range from 75 to 105
UNK_UNK mine is currently m=0.02 and FOS=0.22 but my max FOS is 0.24
UNK_UNK Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system?
UNK_UNK okie
UNK_UNK Do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK FOS coz that's minimum
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK Or rather, what affects it
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK the only dimension that I have access to that was different then was the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Broadcast the latest values
UNK_UNK still maxed at 1.23
UNK_UNK Right now I am using 5mm
UNK_UNK for c?
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK is your current value exactly 90?
UNK_UNK can we try and see the final values if the bore diameter is 75?
UNK_UNK Don't think so
UNK_UNK Have you been changing the piston and seeing how the piston-pin can be changed?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to do that as well
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK I can sacrifice some fos if it will take off a lot of mass
UNK_UNK interesting
UNK_UNK ok it went up to 300 rn
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK No idea
UNK_UNK yeah i think his fos usually gets 0.05
UNK_UNK fos is bad
UNK_UNK bore diameter flywheel shaft diameter and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK you can change it and change it back if it gets worse
UNK_UNK ive already mentally prepared to be disappointed
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK 60
UNK_UNK what factors does your sheet that you depend on that come from other people?
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK I think the crankshaft person is the one throwing the values all around
UNK_UNK everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK Anything you need from me yet
UNK_UNK I agree. My part increases in weight linearly and increases in FOS exponentially so its probably better to maximize it. Do you have a part that increases in FOS only linearly? you can see it on the graphs
UNK_UNK did oyu change?
UNK_UNK looks like we're done?
UNK_UNK I can't change it from here because it will lower mass, but it will also reduce factor of safety
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK we can both move. i have to tell teh others also becuase they depend on it
UNK_UNK So, I can increase FOS by alot but my part would weigh, so I could
UNK_UNK ok that's good
UNK_UNK 1.35 i mean
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK what r do you have for the pin?
UNK_UNK Not from what I understand
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK flywheel - update the group when you change!
UNK_UNK I have D at 40
UNK_UNK might be piston
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK Hi how is it going?
UNK_UNK back at80
UNK_UNK New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK yep i got it
UNK_UNK any preference on the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Easy $20 :D
UNK_UNK mine depends on yours but my mass has not increased above 2
UNK_UNK the flywheel apparently only has a mass of 1.27
UNK_UNK no nothing affects me
UNK_UNK what are you FS/Ms at rn?
UNK_UNK It seems like the flywheel could be kept at a lower mass without hurting fos. Maybe close to .6?
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK try working more with FS if you can. Ours is so low
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK what fos are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK we're at good
UNK_UNK k, maybe not then
UNK_UNK Okay, lowest ms i can get is like 5.42
UNK_UNK Have you changed your values any?
UNK_UNK Alrighty. Just updated it
UNK_UNK what was the diameter you use?
UNK_UNK Great - we're getting close.  I'm trying to figure out who keeps changing their broadcasted values
UNK_UNK i haven't updated
UNK_UNK I havn't changed it since the beginning
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK 61.91
UNK_UNK ok mine is like .5-1 so im trying to change fos more
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK I think it's at 2 right now
UNK_UNK i have no clue whats happening with that. my mass is too low to have an impact
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77 now, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK ok good. I would just assume your part has the most mass
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK only need a fos of 2
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK What's your flywheel shaft diameter and thickness of flywheel?
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK what is your mas and fos?
UNK_UNK gotcha
UNK_UNK I'm good too
UNK_UNK I changed something but it didn't affect my mass at all
UNK_UNK check with the others
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK and how so?
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK D is the diameter of the piston, and T is the thickness of the head
UNK_UNK 0.91
UNK_UNK Mine is in the range of thousands.  So i guess I don't have to worry about it? only the smallest matters right
UNK_UNK who many rounds do we getr?
UNK_UNK No i changed the thickness but Im about to decrease the bore diameter because the piston pin designer wants to
UNK_UNK so If i maximize both my design variables
UNK_UNK Amazing
UNK_UNK i switched it back to 45
UNK_UNK Do you know how changing D effects your numbers?
UNK_UNK it looks like my factor of safety is the lowest at 2.03, so if you need to make yours lighter and reduce the factor of safety, that would be ideal
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK are you making any changes ?
UNK_UNK Our dimensions line up at least
UNK_UNK Ok do you have a set variable? In your chart
UNK_UNK Ok, mine is only .5. Idk how fos works but mine goes above 5k
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK what's your mass ?
UNK_UNK yo bro
UNK_UNK i could change so that it have fos of 2 but weights 2 kg lighter
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK it's 5625 but my part has a weird fos
UNK_UNK D= 47.4 or 40 for me
UNK_UNK without going above D = 42
UNK_UNK 0.13
UNK_UNK no worries
UNK_UNK we can try smaller mass
UNK_UNK does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
UNK_UNK I have t1, L, and r
UNK_UNK what is your mass rn
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK I think 75 is the best right now
UNK_UNK Is higher or lower D better for you?
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK 11.3
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK mine is only mass dependent as FOS is very high
UNK_UNK wait in the complete range?
UNK_UNK (i think)
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK Also, does me increasing c help you at all?
UNK_UNK which do you need
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK our mass still needs to go down so try and lower that as much as possible
UNK_UNK It's 3.41
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK can you change it just to see
UNK_UNK i think ive optimized my part
UNK_UNK we would want to reduce weight without reducing fs
UNK_UNK Whichever gets you the highest
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK Mass: 1.75 FOS:6.07
UNK_UNK Im at 2nd lowest mass
UNK_UNK I'm going to need to know the crankshaft bearing offset when you have it
UNK_UNK Do you have any parameters that depend on the connecting rod?
UNK_UNK the one all the way on top under global is for our whole team
UNK_UNK Looks like were close again now
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK I can increase the FOS, but it almost isn't worth it with how much weight is added on
UNK_UNK what are yourmass/fos
UNK_UNK it was 2.79 then made a couple changes and now it 1.25
UNK_UNK what's your fos
UNK_UNK Yea i believe so. what is it?
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK Hey, how are your masses and FS looking? Ranges?
UNK_UNK What is the bearing support offset you are using?
UNK_UNK Perfect!
UNK_UNK he and i talked
UNK_UNK REFRESH IT, ITS LOWER THAN 2 RIGHT NOW
UNK_UNK Just broadcasted it, looks like 55 for D was a good choice
UNK_UNK did you get your mass down?
UNK_UNK did you try playing around with bearing offset ?
UNK_UNK there are rounds?
UNK_UNK agreed but isnt the factor of safety shown above that of the part with the lowest fos?
UNK_UNK Im at 0.1 rn with a fos of 2.52
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK (D) piston bore
UNK_UNK I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
UNK_UNK our mass is already 10kg too high
UNK_UNK we may reduce D just a hair because of the given LD ratio if it helps connecting rod reduce mass
UNK_UNK What's your system mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK something changed we were closer
UNK_UNK No only the inner piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK hey what changes in mass have you noticed (if any) when you change the bearing support offset?
UNK_UNK Large. 3852.93
UNK_UNK 4706.67, I've reduced my mass as far as possible
UNK_UNK i need to determine a piston diamter first because i think that is most important of my two variables
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK We got very good
UNK_UNK our quality just went way down, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK D = 40 works best for me if you can make that work
UNK_UNK what up
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK Yo
UNK_UNK alright thank you
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK your FOS is in the thousands????
UNK_UNK Then its probably crankshaft that has to minimize somehow
UNK_UNK I do not believe so
UNK_UNK okay I'll keep lowering it
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK m=3.48
UNK_UNK okay it shows us at very good, not excellent
UNK_UNK If that's the same as the thickness of the connecting rod, then I'm currently at 2 mm
UNK_UNK th, D, m, fos
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK More than 2 is excellent
UNK_UNK nope. thanks.
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK Will do I wrote them down
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK what is the lowest mass you got while keeping FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK haha
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK Could you try decreasing it again? I'm trying to raise my FOS more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK on it
UNK_UNK flyweel is good too
UNK_UNK I just got my mass down to 0.11
UNK_UNK Nope, only need one thing from the piston
UNK_UNK What's the best crankshaft offset?
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK do we just sit here now?
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Well you've got the crankshaft, it should be the heaviest
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK I have control over D
UNK_UNK so someone is a little confused
UNK_UNK connect 4
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK 1
UNK_UNK yes. d from 20 to 15
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK yup thats working!
UNK_UNK I think we need a larger shaft diameter and smaller thickness
UNK_UNK Yo
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK Someone picked an FS of 0.51
UNK_UNK Me neither. I think it was flywheel?
UNK_UNK I have the piston set to near lowest mass (m=0.69 and fos = 3.84) sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK I choose the part with lowest mass and FOS above 2
UNK_UNK you need to change your current broadcast
UNK_UNK its 1.52 with that
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK Yea I believe so.
UNK_UNK I also have that dimension
UNK_UNK No i changed th piston head thickness but not the diameter
UNK_UNK What levels of mass are you dealing with?
UNK_UNK how do I broadcast?
UNK_UNK i havent changed anything
UNK_UNK What's the updated mass for the crankshaft?
UNK_UNK Are you good with the results?
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK was your fos less than 1 now
UNK_UNK _|X|_
UNK_UNK its 80 rn
UNK_UNK ok looks like you have the biggest % of mass in our system
UNK_UNK thats what they were at when we had excellent
UNK_UNK our value is really good right now
UNK_UNK I am also not trying to change the design form here.
UNK_UNK what are your numbers
UNK_UNK unless it drastically changes the mass
UNK_UNK yeah that was because of mass i think and i decreased it by .01 so probably not me
UNK_UNK What are the the piston bore diameter are we making?
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK got em
UNK_UNK I was asked to keep my parameters constant
UNK_UNK i can do 40 easy
UNK_UNK mass 1.24 & FOS 2.01, but if bore diameter was reduced to 40 it could be m= 1.15 and FOS = 1.79
UNK_UNK ok got one
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK shows it as broadcasting for me
UNK_UNK What is our piston Bore?
UNK_UNK whats the best fos you've had?
UNK_UNK i asked
UNK_UNK im not surprised,he has a pretty big head
UNK_UNK group: who wants to go next?
UNK_UNK Ok. Our FOS isn't too bad right now so that's probably a good place to be at the moment
UNK_UNK now poor
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK got 0.1kg and Fos = 2.77
UNK_UNK mine is m=0.69 and fos = 3.84
UNK_UNK piston head thickness and piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK if i go all the way to min weight is cuts fos and only shaves .03kg
UNK_UNK Is 70 the best value for bore design or have you not messed with it yet?
UNK_UNK What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
UNK_UNK done!
UNK_UNK okay, i havent updated in awhile
UNK_UNK ill set piston bore diameter to max and we can iterate from there
UNK_UNK says very good
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK Right now I have D=85
UNK_UNK my fos is too high to change anything so i kept mine at lowest m
UNK_UNK I have my best broadcast for the available thing
UNK_UNK our quality just went way down, so if you changed anything try to change it back
UNK_UNK Awesome, thank you
UNK_UNK can you bring FOS down? it only needs to be 2
UNK_UNK 2.77 for a diameter of 40
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK what do you need
UNK_UNK ratio for piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK The diameter is now at 40.
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK Cause I've been running simulations using the minimum piston diameter
UNK_UNK Ok. it seems like this engine keeps getting heavier so i'm gonna make the piston smaller to change that
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK we are at excellent agian
UNK_UNK *Do you guys just want to keep this setting and change one at a time?
UNK_UNK what factors of the crank shaft?
UNK_UNK If I hold my variables same, the lower the diameter, the lower the Ms and fos
UNK_UNK yeah unless someone knows how to increase factor of safety without increasing mass significantly
UNK_UNK everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
UNK_UNK i control Ti and r1
UNK_UNK We are good, he said his FOS went up when I changed it down to 45
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK ok sweet
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK as i increase it I can increase FOS some
UNK_UNK Ok thank you.
UNK_UNK Did you broadcast anything recently?
UNK_UNK broadcasting 2.85 with a mass of 1.36
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK is that your ideal dim?
UNK_UNK I am checking a few things so values may be weird for a minute
UNK_UNK Hell to the yeah
UNK_UNK lets decrease mass
UNK_UNK what have you been in control of?
UNK_UNK i dont want to mess it up
UNK_UNK Do I have any variables that affect your result?
UNK_UNK our value is really good right now and the 1.71 and 4.55 are my current values
UNK_UNK aight did you broadcast anything?
UNK_UNK I havent updated anything
UNK_UNK Diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK no I don't need either
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK no problem
UNK_UNK not me, at lowest weight possible
UNK_UNK No, that does not affect it either
UNK_UNK I'm gonna try to keep the conrod-crank ratio down
UNK_UNK you need values from me?
UNK_UNK it still doesnt
UNK_UNK try putting it on the high end to see if that impacts our fos significantly
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK maybe lower if needed
UNK_UNK You'll need to broadcast that. The most recent broadcast value we have is 80.
UNK_UNK they said they ddnt
UNK_UNK Hi, looks like we should increase the factor of safety. What factor of safety do you have for the piston
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK Yeah me too, just told everyone to calm down a little3
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK do you need my thickness to increase?
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK piston-pin is not responding
UNK_UNK it just keeps flipping so someone is touching something
UNK_UNK 75-105
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK piston
UNK_UNK diameter is 25 mm
UNK_UNK 18.63 and fos = 2.06
UNK_UNK 1.27
UNK_UNK huh I would ask a TA then,
UNK_UNK yeah Im doing that after every sim, we're already in the very good range
UNK_UNK what are your values
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK crankshaft offset*
UNK_UNK yeah that's what I thought
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK what do you control!
UNK_UNK sounds good, flywheel now needs to check theirs i think
UNK_UNK is your objectives different?
UNK_UNK Our FOS just dropped a ton
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12
UNK_UNK End experiment, nice worK!
UNK_UNK u mean 80?
UNK_UNK I mean Fs only needs to be greater than 2
UNK_UNK I can try, that is the limit tho
UNK_UNK crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
UNK_UNK and yes I'm broadcasting that
UNK_UNK What are you broadcasting?\
UNK_UNK Okay, so your FS are in a slightly higher order
UNK_UNK i dont think so
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK 0.1 and 2.55
UNK_UNK 2.77 is my minimum mass and fos I'm afraid
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK what is your pin diameter?
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK Thanks. If 40mm doesn't work let's see if we can meet in the middle somewhere
UNK_UNK Ok, our FOS is good now, so I think we should keep it there. Now, we need to find a way to reduce mass.
UNK_UNK m = 0.12 with f at 3.44
UNK_UNK I agree. I am still at the same place I was at when we had excellent. I have not changed my variables. I was just saying that I cannot help in bringing down the mass any further
UNK_UNK something changed we were closer
UNK_UNK How much mass?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK my lowest mass is 0.12, im currently at 0.37
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK I'm seeing 1.75
UNK_UNK wait can you explain again
UNK_UNK Good point, 40 is the lower limit
UNK_UNK let me know if you need to go any lower
UNK_UNK If that is true you would be right by saying have everyone pick the lowest mass with FS less then 2
UNK_UNK my thickness and diameter is almost at the bott
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK ayyyyyy
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK I dont no
UNK_UNK What are your initial ideas for bearing offset?
UNK_UNK i'm not
UNK_UNK Ah okay, gotcha
UNK_UNK are you changing stuff?
UNK_UNK okay can di
UNK_UNK okay so I think i need a smaller Piston Bore diameter
UNK_UNK as long as you dont dramatically decrease your Fs because i think most oif it is coming from you
UNK_UNK Agreed. 3.05
UNK_UNK thats getting better, Im working w the piston to find the best D and will let you konw when we do
UNK_UNK wait so I asked piston to lower his mass. So now my fos is lowered to 70, 
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK connecting rod thickness (t1) and connecting rod length ratio (r1)
UNK_UNK 12 kg? damn
UNK_UNK The mass increased a lot
UNK_UNK check for broadcast
UNK_UNK Ok, any luck getting it back to excellent?
UNK_UNK the one guy did not respond to my message
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK No, I do not believe so
UNK_UNK just did
UNK_UNK My weight is around 0.1 so I can't change it much?
UNK_UNK did you change?
UNK_UNK one second
UNK_UNK for ds tf and stuff
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK anyway to reduce mass while keeping fos above 2?
UNK_UNK mass as low as possible
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK the other parts weigh 0.1,0.06,0.52 and 0.99
UNK_UNK m_s : 10.4;   fos_s : 7.37;
UNK_UNK Does it look to you like we're meeting the global requirements now?
UNK_UNK yeah but that increase weight by .5 gram is that worth it for you
UNK_UNK if im not stupid
UNK_UNK It seems like the crankshaft is what is limiting us right now, in terms of mass and fos
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK just barely above 2
UNK_UNK someone touched it
UNK_UNK i did it
UNK_UNK What kind of bore diameter are you thinking?
UNK_UNK what is the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Do you know who controls those factors?
UNK_UNK how much does that effect your numbers
UNK_UNK is that your mass or FOS value
UNK_UNK i havent changed or broadcasted anything since making my variables their minimum
UNK_UNK I'm not entirely sure. No matter what inputs I have, my mass and fos aren't changing and it;s a bit confusing
UNK_UNK let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK should I try to lean toward FS since my masses are about 1 to 4 and FS ranges are .5 to 3 ish?
UNK_UNK they were the minimum of both
UNK_UNK TA is saying time is up
UNK_UNK oops, wrong value, my bad
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK *increaseing
UNK_UNK Is there anything I can do to help you?
UNK_UNK I'm on second lowest diameter at the moment
UNK_UNK and crank pin diameter
UNK_UNK try flyweel thickness as 12.0 and shaft diameter as 60.0
UNK_UNK oh mine says 11
UNK_UNK Yeah I just saw that. and our weight is massive
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK Me too
UNK_UNK I hit up the piston but they never got back to me
UNK_UNK sounds good, ill do 45
UNK_UNK sorry, I just need D as well
UNK_UNK i didnt move
UNK_UNK mass:2.12 FOS: 7.02 right now
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK Hello, Do you need any parameters from me? 
UNK_UNK right, but what is the third blank you fill out to run simulations? Do you have one?
UNK_UNK i dont think it actually changes the FOS
UNK_UNK I have the piston bore diameter set to 47.5 currently
UNK_UNK What's your current FOS?
UNK_UNK 1.14
UNK_UNK doe increasing D give you better weight?
UNK_UNK It looks like our engine design is excellent then. And yes that works with my design requirements
UNK_UNK Please do
UNK_UNK larger piston bore increases both m and fos
UNK_UNK Piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK What is your range for diameter?
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK my mass increases significantly with a small change in bore diameter
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK I think it's all coming from crankshaft. He doesnt seem to know whats going on
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK yep...
UNK_UNK Right now its at 90
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK Make sure you dont drop too much mass though
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK My FS is around 2. Some parts may just have different ranges
UNK_UNK how you doing
UNK_UNK Yea flywheel is the problem
UNK_UNK What is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK 0.1/2.77
UNK_UNK so thats nice
UNK_UNK tf of 10 is the best for mass
UNK_UNK WE are GOOD
UNK_UNK It just changed back to good
UNK_UNK wait*
UNK_UNK I'm going to try and get my diameter valu down for the crank pin to save on mass, we're not doing too bad with fos
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK stop changing
UNK_UNK I'm seeing a system wide fos of 0.5
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK It might be the flywheel or crankshaft folks
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK 1.38
UNK_UNK what is your mass currently?
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK do you think increase fos of lighter componet while decreasing fos of my part will work?
UNK_UNK GOOD
UNK_UNK I cant decrease the weight without decreasing the facto of safety below 2
UNK_UNK currently at mass 47.81, FOS 2.32
UNK_UNK piston is in charge of the diameter
UNK_UNK i just reduced my mass
UNK_UNK we got it
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK it just went back to "poor"
UNK_UNK So we can keep it low
UNK_UNK We're good
UNK_UNK Well it's between 40 and 70 so maybe like 55 to start? I'll run some simulations
UNK_UNK Ok. I just updated my settings to be m=0.02 and FOS=0.22
UNK_UNK does your design depend on the crankshaft?
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK who are you
UNK_UNK What can you change that increases your FOS?
UNK_UNK can we make it better?
UNK_UNK oh okay my handout said piston pin diameter should be displayed but isnt
UNK_UNK whenever some of you change parameters my weight and FS changes
UNK_UNK m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK because the overall mass and FOS are changing drastically - they were good a little bit ago, now they're horrible lol
UNK_UNK try bore diamter of 40
UNK_UNK we are at very good
UNK_UNK Anything else I can help optimse?
UNK_UNK I'm at mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK thats the smallest weight and it gives part level fos of 4.55
UNK_UNK 0.52
UNK_UNK ms=0.52 fos=1215
UNK_UNK bad change, not me
UNK_UNK "Select a design to broadcast"
UNK_UNK any preference on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I can chang the diameter
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK No I have not
UNK_UNK I need to find the optimum value for that. Assume it to be 25 for now
UNK_UNK D ds and tf
UNK_UNK 3.03
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters?
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK nobody change anythibn
UNK_UNK do you know if you can reduce mass?
UNK_UNK I don't control that aspect it affects my value but I don't control it
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK basically c = 85  and dc =15
UNK_UNK how do i know it wasnt you??
UNK_UNK we reached good
UNK_UNK my fos is 0.24
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK What did you guys get
UNK_UNK my part maintains FOS=2.06
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK if we could decrease for another 2 kg we should get excellent
UNK_UNK what are your input params besides the bore diam?
UNK_UNK in the table with the simulations is what we get from our own parts
UNK_UNK Yeah, I have not changed anything yet but found out that someone has the same parameter as me.
UNK_UNK do you depend on t1 or r1?
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK mine says Very Good
UNK_UNK terrible
UNK_UNK ms: 1.71, fos: 4.55
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK did you get very good simulation?
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK Increasing the diameter will increase both factor of safety as well as the mass
UNK_UNK fake
UNK_UNK yeah same
UNK_UNK As D gets lower, my ms gets way to high
UNK_UNK What's your sub-system mass now?
UNK_UNK masses in the hundreths
UNK_UNK Yeah I agree. I'll see what they can do
UNK_UNK Has the crankshaft got back to you about their FOS?
UNK_UNK nice, mine is a lower D gives lower mass and fos doesnt rly change
UNK_UNK oof
UNK_UNK $2 missed
UNK_UNK Okay cool, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK any good values for the piston bore D?
UNK_UNK That is when I also use maximum piston bore diameter which is not under my control
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK lower increases my mass and FOS
UNK_UNK Have you changed bore diameter at all?
UNK_UNK whats your mass
UNK_UNK do you need to know any flywheel variables?
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK Flywheel Thickness and Flywheel Shaft Diameter
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK the fos went up from 4821 to 5625
UNK_UNK increase in either variable causes both the mass and FOS to go up
UNK_UNK sorry team just realized i wasn't broadcasting mine
UNK_UNK FOS just went down
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK one sec
UNK_UNK what are your values now?
UNK_UNK we were at excellent but now its very good
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK Ok, and your mass is pretty small, so it isn't a big deal. Mine is currently 27.44, so I'm trying to reduce it
UNK_UNK Just did. I think that made it heavier
UNK_UNK know whats our next challenge
UNK_UNK right now we need to focus on mass
UNK_UNK i see
UNK_UNK 60 mm
UNK_UNK I believe we all have lowest masses setup now. Make sure to check for broadcasts. We'll take it from there.
UNK_UNK Our FOS just got very low. Any idea which part it is?
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK Mass 5.2 FOS 3.91
UNK_UNK ya'' should chat about that
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK you need to broadcast your simulation results. after simulating, you hit broadcast results and then you select the simulation number you want to broadcast and it will add it to the global results
UNK_UNK 12 is the best I got
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK alright we're at very good, I say lets leave it at this
UNK_UNK 2
UNK_UNK the thickness(t_I) ranges from 5 to 15 mm, and ratio(r1) ranges from 5 to 5
UNK_UNK duh
UNK_UNK and what are your numbers when you do that
UNK_UNK try and use 60 for C
UNK_UNK Isn't a factor of safety of 2 considered outstanding, most of mine are in the hundreds.
UNK_UNK No, I'm at 3.23. Trying to drop that a bit and lower my mass. I'm at 2.11 for mass.
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK what variables affect your decisions
UNK_UNK and piston  diameter will affect my performance quality
UNK_UNK I did it do you see it?
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK The conrod said you should change it so they can see how it affects their numbers
UNK_UNK so we need to work together for c
UNK_UNK That is my highest fos value
UNK_UNK if you can lower mass while keeping fos>2, try to
UNK_UNK do those have names or are they just called that, I think you might control something I'm not seeing for some reason
UNK_UNK You need to coordinate with crankshaft to reduce his.her mass, crankshaft is the heaviest part
UNK_UNK c=60, dc=15
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK are you in control of the shafdt dimaeter if so what is it and its thickness
UNK_UNK How is your design coming along, do you need any data from me?
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK right now its 40 yes
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK Flywheel i think i found an optimal solution - crankshaft said the same
UNK_UNK now3.05
UNK_UNK I just updated it to that. I'll let the other people know
UNK_UNK I don't know how to find that info
UNK_UNK No I'm using the crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK I currently have the lightest mass and it is still too much.
UNK_UNK okay. my mass doesn't change that much so i can change to 20
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK ds = 50
UNK_UNK Same here, the total simulation was very good for two seconds and that someone completely messed it up
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK its too low to have the impact it is having
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK Oh I see, yea I'll work on that now
UNK_UNK Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK We're a little above the mass but otherwise good
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK Is that value working for you or would it work better if D was larger
UNK_UNK difference of about 0.1
UNK_UNK we still need to reduce mass by a lot
UNK_UNK X X O ; O O _ ; X O _
UNK_UNK Not too bad, not excited for the lab
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK 1.3 and mass is too high
UNK_UNK ds is 20
UNK_UNK keep it up and we'll trim from there
UNK_UNK 3.05
UNK_UNK I'll send a message too see if they'll respond
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK 58
UNK_UNK whats your fos? mine is 2.09, piston is 2.09 as well
UNK_UNK Ok that doesn't affect mine
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK Not sure yet.
UNK_UNK or global?
UNK_UNK Yep, values finalized
UNK_UNK I think the flywheel is changing
UNK_UNK bearing support offest
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK 2.04
UNK_UNK what diameter should i use. i can have a good factor of safety with a diameter of 97.5
UNK_UNK I think your part is ok to be heavier
UNK_UNK yes save those values and we can try to get excellent
UNK_UNK Don't worry, you're a pistonpin you can do anything
UNK_UNK nice!
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop more mass
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK .06 and 2.62
UNK_UNK What's your current FOS?
UNK_UNK not yet, might change to thickness 12 diameter 40 because my FOS is huge
UNK_UNK Are you still using 80 for your diameter?
UNK_UNK 2
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight of the piston
UNK_UNK idk...
UNK_UNK What requirements do you have on the Piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK piston pin has theirs at 1.23 and says that's their highest option
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK What mass ranges do you have the option of?
UNK_UNK Alright, b/c we have the given parameter LDr = 1.2 and I have control of D
UNK_UNK What's your system mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK Ms= 1.15, FOS 2.29.Next option is 2.29,
UNK_UNK I'm not sure how this works tbh haha
UNK_UNK Did you make any change after it was at very good?
UNK_UNK Update it I'm at excellent now
UNK_UNK oh the round number is the simulation number
UNK_UNK I'm jumping between (0.7,0.7) and (0.7,0.8) for my values - the first option gives a higher factor of safety at the cost of a higher mass
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK Minimizing bore diameter helps my stuff too
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK i dont htink piston did either
UNK_UNK BTW, shaved my mass down a tad. m = 0.52 now
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK 170 is working for me
UNK_UNK I just dont know why our FS is so low
UNK_UNK There?
UNK_UNK So I decreased weight, and kept same FOS
UNK_UNK whats dc
UNK_UNK Yes, my most recent design is what is broadcasted
UNK_UNK great - please leave it there
UNK_UNK i am interested in the crankshaft bearing offset by another designer
UNK_UNK btw our mass is still big, the piston pin only contribute roughly only 0.1 kg of mass
UNK_UNK Just did
UNK_UNK current broadcast includes the smallest values that i have access to
UNK_UNK No i don't think so
UNK_UNK like i kinda dgaf about 375 anymore
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK sorry 225 first
UNK_UNK So we do not have piston pin and crankshaft engineers?
UNK_UNK It would be nice if we had a group chat so we didn't have to blindly flail about, not knowing who has been told what yet
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK oh 60 is good
UNK_UNK Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK ok and i think mine is only related to piston pin guy
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Yeah i figured that out when mine was lowest lol
UNK_UNK group: can we all try broadcasting settings that are in the middle of our ranges?
UNK_UNK Awesome same here
UNK_UNK Hey, do you happen to have a value for the crank shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK mass
UNK_UNK no - must be someone else I guess?
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK what's your current bore diameter
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, just need to reduce the mass
UNK_UNK can you get it above 2?\
UNK_UNK Nice.
UNK_UNK I'm at the 4th lowest weight I can be at out of 25 options
UNK_UNK smallest
UNK_UNK When I use maximum values, the mass is 36.38 and f is 22.95.
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK _|O|O
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK itll say your current mass, find the one thats 3 kg lower and then find the fos
UNK_UNK i broadcasted my best
UNK_UNK no they remain the same
UNK_UNK Let me decrease my thickness a bit
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)(bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK Projected outputs
UNK_UNK excellent?
UNK_UNK crankshaft is talking, but he/she depends on flywheel
UNK_UNK so don't think I need to make the diameter bigger unless another subsystem does
UNK_UNK ok i get fos of 5 and ms of 7
UNK_UNK ahh, its changed for me
UNK_UNK i havent really started yet
UNK_UNK Okay no longer good on FOS
UNK_UNK ya we just lowered it all the way, how are your numbers
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Does the thickness of the piston head effect your part at all?
UNK_UNK I dont think we were supposed to finish that quick
UNK_UNK Recheck your broadcast. it just went to poor
UNK_UNK Diameter = 40mm
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
UNK_UNK Are you currently changing values?
UNK_UNK pistom-pin designer says increase the diameter
UNK_UNK ok I have mass: 3.05, FOS 2.02
UNK_UNK no clue
UNK_UNK what about thickness of flywheel?
UNK_UNK They are t_I and r_1.
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK Can you do that? Right now its at 50
UNK_UNK What is your mass?
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK Have you broadcasted your most recent design?
UNK_UNK ya, seems like we have agreement on that
UNK_UNK We need to have the heavy parts drop mass
UNK_UNK 4706
UNK_UNK what variables do you control?
UNK_UNK Hi, I'm working on the piston-pin design what parameters are you changing for your design?
UNK_UNK I've kept my numbers steady for a while
UNK_UNK It just updated
UNK_UNK someone is changing stuff
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK mass is 0.52, FOS is 2.01, and one of my values is minimized. not sure how much more I can optimize currently
UNK_UNK Crankshaft asked for bore diameter. Thats all
UNK_UNK exactly
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK With my current design, mass is 0.52 and Fs is 2.0
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK are all the values you get assuming you maximize the variables out of your control?
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK dont change it theyre changing it back
UNK_UNK ok i did
UNK_UNK the c and dc i currently have yields best fos which is 2.283 but it's not the lightest
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK sitting at 2.77
UNK_UNK Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
UNK_UNK all i do is fall asleep in that class tho
UNK_UNK MASS: 25.95, FOS 2.27
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK 2.31
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK For sure.
UNK_UNK so I lowered the diameter and it brought the fs back down
UNK_UNK cool, let us know if we should change the bore diameter
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is 5000??
UNK_UNK Aim for FOS to be above 2 while minimizing mass
UNK_UNK We need an FS of 1.5
UNK_UNK Has yours updated yet?
UNK_UNK What do your fos numbers look like?
UNK_UNK the piston wont respond to me
UNK_UNK Okay. We're probably at the best we can do. Will talk to other designerd.
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK i jjust changed one thing and it brought mass down little, try to change your numbers slightly maybe?
UNK_UNK ours just does donuts as of rn
UNK_UNK Any idea if the piston diameter should change?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Did you just change something?
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK flywheel is 0.52 currently
UNK_UNK tandy
UNK_UNK Keep your FOS above 2
UNK_UNK My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK ok i can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK For the 4 simulations shown above does yours have projected outputs being 1: ms: 21.88, 2: ms: 30.51, 3: ms: 49.03?
UNK_UNK I think you and I have the most influence over total mass. What is your current mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK What's the FOS of your current selection? I'm trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over FOS
UNK_UNK Do you need any information from me?
UNK_UNK okay let's tell everyone to stop changing stuff rn
UNK_UNK Which FS are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK im at 2.36 for fos
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting 2.77
UNK_UNK Are you ending the experiment
UNK_UNK but stil m=3.48
UNK_UNK i made my connector rod to crank length ratio 4
UNK_UNK What do you need from me?
UNK_UNK does a larger diameter increase your mass? or decrease it?
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK mine is 1.48
UNK_UNK who moved we are at poor now
UNK_UNK try 51  for t and 50 for ds
UNK_UNK i  believe at least one member's part is too heavy
UNK_UNK thats great, im at 0.1,2.62
UNK_UNK Ok, I will try that now
UNK_UNK DONT CHANGE
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Connecting rod says they are at FOS = 2.77
UNK_UNK what what happened? We had our FOS above 2..
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK what flywheel factors affect the bearing offset? as in changing the flywheel thickness/diameter?
UNK_UNK All my sims seem to have it at 40 rn
UNK_UNK any ideas to get bumped up
UNK_UNK do you have the flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK 2.03FOS is about the fos we can do and still be very good / excellent. we need to drop the mass
UNK_UNK what variable do you control?
UNK_UNK If you make it bigger, mass goes up and fos as well?
UNK_UNK awesome fos
UNK_UNK your variables affect the other measurements
UNK_UNK _|_|o
UNK_UNK can you try broadcasting it since we are over 12 kg
UNK_UNK So is there any tradeoff at all?
UNK_UNK ok i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK we are at very good right now
UNK_UNK Now Im at good. weights a bit high but FOS is right on
UNK_UNK to 15
UNK_UNK if you lower D I can raise the FOS with ds
UNK_UNK woof woof
UNK_UNK group: who's next?
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK true. what's your mass?
UNK_UNK pass it on
UNK_UNK But weight is 25
UNK_UNK maybe we need to be secret
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK oops sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK im at 60
UNK_UNK mass 27.44
UNK_UNK crankshaft weighs the most i think
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK why?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK higher D is better FOS, and worse (higher) mass
UNK_UNK what are your mass/fos
UNK_UNK Hey, I need to know what PISTON BORE DIAMETER you are planning to use for my calculations
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK mm
UNK_UNK Hey so what changes have you made so far to the piston design?
UNK_UNK what range of fos #s are you getting? mine are in the hundreds so it's not the limiting system
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting that?
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK have you figure out how D effects ur numbers
UNK_UNK hi, what are your working on?
UNK_UNK you can go
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK Cause we're still really high on weight
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK I can adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter, do those affect yours?
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK D isn't controlled by me
UNK_UNK 2.06 right
UNK_UNK great job
UNK_UNK 2.04, no bene
UNK_UNK we are at very good
UNK_UNK Smaller diameter is better for me
UNK_UNK I just changed my FOS to 3.78 but a higher mass. That's the closest I have to 2.09
UNK_UNK it would increase my fos some
UNK_UNK niceee haha
UNK_UNK bottom
UNK_UNK We were at excellent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK so lmk if it stays at 150
UNK_UNK for the last simulation it is 43
UNK_UNK its t_h = 4 and D = 75
UNK_UNK i  depennd on C
UNK_UNK oh right
UNK_UNK I'm using a crank pin diameter of 15 at the moment, in case you needed that value
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK thanks!! you too!
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK So far, the 90mm looked better than the 97.5mm
UNK_UNK He wont respond lol
UNK_UNK what's your fos
UNK_UNK The bearing support off set that is ideal for me is 40
UNK_UNK Thats great
UNK_UNK We've got a "Good" engine
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK Okay I'll let you know what I get
UNK_UNK getting close
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK My mass is 1.12, Fos is 4707
UNK_UNK do you need r2 or r3?
UNK_UNK also what are your ds and tf values
UNK_UNK I also have a second parameter that increases fos and mass if I increase that
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK what is your fos? can you reduce your mass at all while staying above fos=2.1
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase when you increase the offset by 10 mm?
UNK_UNK can get 2.62 fos with .01 extra mass
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK Ok, just making sure, thanks
UNK_UNK Oh I did not receive that update, I'll try my numbers at 40 
UNK_UNK you have one that works well for you?
UNK_UNK we are back to very good now too
UNK_UNK The length of the crankshaft
UNK_UNK So I think lower D is better
UNK_UNK yeah i optimized mine as much as ic an
UNK_UNK 47.5
UNK_UNK In D = 75?
UNK_UNK sup
UNK_UNK well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
UNK_UNK it is at 150
UNK_UNK can you reduce mass but keep FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK thickness = 8
UNK_UNK yes, 75 works for me and piston
UNK_UNK m= 3.46 fos=0.3
UNK_UNK i don't think either of those affect me
UNK_UNK yo, what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK I change it back to 80 since the overall results for 75 are not good
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK because my part weighs so little, ill just focus on the fos
UNK_UNK tf = 22 and ds = 49
UNK_UNK Crankshaft is at 1.49 for m
UNK_UNK What's your mass rn?
UNK_UNK really?
UNK_UNK I dont have control over it. I think its you and the piston. Seems to me like the low 80 range was working best though but Im not sure
UNK_UNK You good to leave
UNK_UNK and mass?
UNK_UNK By how much would be good for you?
UNK_UNK its as small as itll go
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS
UNK_UNK No, I only have one good value. No experimentation required
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK you next?
UNK_UNK the highest fos rn for me is 0.89
UNK_UNK now it's back ?? idk
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK what's your factor of safety currently
UNK_UNK Is it better for the piston bore diameter to be larger or smaller?
UNK_UNK crankshaft told me to maximize the diameter, so I used 70mm
UNK_UNK Made diameter 75
UNK_UNK okay, what's your weight?
UNK_UNK Flywheel isn't communicating thats the problem
UNK_UNK Yes, I just figured out how to use the software. Let me check it out
UNK_UNK cant decrease it anymore, its at 40
UNK_UNK we need to do better though lol
UNK_UNK Try broadcasting 80
UNK_UNK Working with you and piston as well
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK Do you know how C affects your FoS
UNK_UNK Oh shit never updated it hell yeah
UNK_UNK what is the mass of your system?
UNK_UNK im so confused what happened
UNK_UNK nah i dont think that would change the varialbes for me
UNK_UNK What does it look like for you?
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK ok ill see
UNK_UNK Someone picked an FS of 0.51
UNK_UNK 2.08
UNK_UNK hmmm okay
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK okay sweet
UNK_UNK O|X|X
UNK_UNK Our mass keeps going up
UNK_UNK my part doesnt effect mass very much
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK I think the piston pin fos could be increased without costing too much mass
UNK_UNK Piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK yeah nope
UNK_UNK Same happened to me a bit ago
UNK_UNK Do you understand how it al fits together. I feel like we all only see that small snapshot of our component
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK K, lowest I can make my weight with FOS>2 is 5.42 which is a big improvement
UNK_UNK i havent changed
UNK_UNK 2.31 to 25.99
UNK_UNK ok dont do that
UNK_UNK what is your current mass?
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK I have found a piston bore diameter of around 90 to be best for me
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK hmm ok I'll check around
UNK_UNK 4.55 which is my highest
UNK_UNK What info do you have?
UNK_UNK my masss is 6.28
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK Any luck?
UNK_UNK Hey, can you send me the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK i have 1.7 fos with 58 mass
UNK_UNK I think we are only missing the piston pin engineer actually. So we cannot optimize that part.
UNK_UNK Do you still have your diameter at maximum?
UNK_UNK my part minimized the mass while keeping FOS>2, will keep updating it
UNK_UNK hmm I control the pin that seems to be on the connecting rod. my variables are l1 (length of the pin), and the inner and outer diameter of the pin (di, d0)
UNK_UNK Where do you even see that? My global quality shows poor
UNK_UNK LOL NO
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK you mean the global variables? the FOS is 0.57 right now
UNK_UNK What happens when you decrease piston diameter?
UNK_UNK 3.2, but that's about to decrease since my mass is way too high
UNK_UNK make sure you update the global broadcast
UNK_UNK and t_H
UNK_UNK 1.67
UNK_UNK Hey!
UNK_UNK Basically, if we can each keep our part factor of safety above 2 while minimizing mass, we'll be golden.
UNK_UNK even with max c i still have fos = 300
UNK_UNK and our mass so high
UNK_UNK or it
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK I think tyhe 47.5 produced better results
UNK_UNK the only person changing values is the flywheel
UNK_UNK Hello, is your FOS above 1.5?
UNK_UNK Dont change your values from when we had the high score
UNK_UNK yeah shes definitely like one of the best lecturers in ME
UNK_UNK Its at very good
UNK_UNK Okay. I played around with it at the beginning and I don't think my FOS has a huge affect on the overall FOS. My mass is only 3.17, and my FOS is at 2. That's where I thought I would keep it for now.
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK yes do that
UNK_UNK Have you messaged the others about this yet?
UNK_UNK ok.  whats the plan stan?
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Just broadcasted it. I chose 55 for D
UNK_UNK I MEAN INCREASE
UNK_UNK I am thanks for letting me know!
UNK_UNK try using 50 mm
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK 1.31
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK i can also cut weight but it will reduce FOS
UNK_UNK nope! do you need info from me?
UNK_UNK Mass is at a min. FOS is still about 4700
UNK_UNK The min FS between us all is the one that is broadcasted right now
UNK_UNK ok sounds good
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
UNK_UNK i meant for your individual part
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK something about 45-50 seems good (low mass and factor of safety above 2)
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK so increase FOS for one component now?
UNK_UNK FS optimization would be best. Try to get the highest mass possible even if it has a low FS
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Piston diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK what are you currently using for D?
UNK_UNK for subsytsem
UNK_UNK i was 2.01 OFS for a sec with a high mass
UNK_UNK any way you can reduce mass?
UNK_UNK what i was told
UNK_UNK Have you broadcasted anything recently?
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK Give me a sec im gonna do a few simulations
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK I think were at safe right now
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK Right now 1.26 but before it was 2.09
UNK_UNK The piston pin length, and the inner and outer diameter of the of the piston pin 
UNK_UNK are you still using A D=40?
UNK_UNK 18.63
UNK_UNK We only need FOS of 2 to get excellent
UNK_UNK but i backed you up
UNK_UNK idk what changed but quality just dropped
UNK_UNK yes both do
UNK_UNK i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK right now at 88 shows very good
UNK_UNK what are the values you put
UNK_UNK can you share all your variables
UNK_UNK is there any way you can reduce mass + FOS and still remain above 2.0?
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK Do you have an estimate to what diameter you want for the piston bore?
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK ok how much can you decrease mass before below 2?
UNK_UNK hahahahaa
UNK_UNK I agree, I also can change the Piston head thickness.
UNK_UNK Whats your lowest mass?
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK Nope, only need one thing from the piston
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK 2.01 still
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK gives excellent
UNK_UNK what about now?
UNK_UNK Are you referring to  the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK does urs go straight
UNK_UNK the 2.95 design also has the lowest mass
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK That sounds ideal to me
UNK_UNK Yeah thats because our parts are heavy
UNK_UNK I didn;t change
UNK_UNK wait we're at very good
UNK_UNK I can broadcast htat
UNK_UNK yes, one minute on that
UNK_UNK it drops the FOS
UNK_UNK let me change around and see what i got
UNK_UNK group - what design variable do you not control that your design depends on
UNK_UNK okay I agree, so I need minimal for me I am thinking.... But how minimal do you think i could go without causing an issue?
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK that fos is good since your part is pretty small
UNK_UNK at least it's the largest part in the system lol\
UNK_UNK acceptable weight now
UNK_UNK mines at 3
UNK_UNK okay we have very good again
UNK_UNK got it, hmmm
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK I'm confident I'm at my optimal setting. No others even close.
UNK_UNK Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK And a thickness of 12?
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK d back to 10 now because fos is high
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK I don't think we need to match our diameter bc mine only goes from 40 to 70
UNK_UNK its the smallest I can go
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK My simulation would be excellent, the broadcast was very good and now poor?
UNK_UNK Hello piston, based on my information, it seems like it would be best to minimize flywheel thickness (tf) and maximize flywheel shaft diameter (ds). Does this work with your design requirements?
UNK_UNK Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK Mine neither
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK Yeah I am happy with this gg
UNK_UNK piston have control over diameter as well, I need the diameter for my variables
UNK_UNK I'm not sure what happened, but if you need me to change anything, let me know. From here all I can do is increase FOS and mass, but we don't need that
UNK_UNK try talk with other designer and see if they need anything
UNK_UNK 60mm
UNK_UNK so basically whatever my fos is is what our system fos is. we need to find a way to increase my max fos
UNK_UNK i am at my lowest
UNK_UNK did it affect the overall?
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK and thickness is 7.5
UNK_UNK DONT MOVE
UNK_UNK Nice!
UNK_UNK I think we are good
UNK_UNK i see that
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK What did you choose your diameter to be?
UNK_UNK ok still at 60
UNK_UNK What is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK That would be my guess too.
UNK_UNK I already got paid haha, although they said if you keep improving it we can get more even afterwars
UNK_UNK Let me know if I can adjust my variables to better suite your requirements
UNK_UNK does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
UNK_UNK I m trying to pick a middle value
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK kk
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK so keep playing with your parameters and ill let you know how it impacts me
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK Hey did you see message from flywheel?
UNK_UNK right now it's 11.09
UNK_UNK Which part do you think has the most mass? mine is small but i can chang FOS a lot
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK Our engine quality is now excellent at least on my screeen
UNK_UNK How does flywheel shaft diameter and thickness affect your mass?
UNK_UNK I think were good. We are at the highest point we can be. Good job!
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK do*
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK Do you have any dependencies with others measurements that could help your values?
UNK_UNK yeah but where you the one who ran the sim and got very good
UNK_UNK change what to what?\
UNK_UNK ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
UNK_UNK I currently have the lkowest mass acceptable for a fs > 2 design.
UNK_UNK mine is at 1.45 now
UNK_UNK I am goint to make the piston smaller so that a smaller connecting rod can be used
UNK_UNK do you have the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I haven't broadcasted yet ho
UNK_UNK Her, how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK What about you?
UNK_UNK whats your weight at?
UNK_UNK Should have gone through? C= 150, dc=50
UNK_UNK i dont think i have that as an input. Unless im missing something.
UNK_UNK I cant get a response tho
UNK_UNK ok maybe try lowering that because it might be a detriment to other peoples FOS
UNK_UNK values are at a minimum for me
UNK_UNK Also, maybe reach out to the other designers about what you have and what you need?
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK increasing c increases mass
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK arent lining up
UNK_UNK Can you decrease c to 60 and see what you get?
UNK_UNK I asked the other designers and the fos seems to be fine
UNK_UNK Do you have any idea about the D value?
UNK_UNK okay i ust put my fos to 63, did it affect it much?
UNK_UNK ok im gonna change the conrod a little to see if i can get it to work. If not Ill just change it back and we'll take Very Good. No one change anything else
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK can you please share your variables with just the letters
UNK_UNK undo what you did
UNK_UNK 20 questions
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK Hey, I just wanted to ask if you needed anything from me
UNK_UNK how about FOS?
UNK_UNK I still see 40
UNK_UNK what's yours?
UNK_UNK what's your mass>
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK what's your mass
UNK_UNK 11.09
UNK_UNK Okay so broadcast a low thickness value and a medium diameter value
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK im at 2.36
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK idk if it helps mass though. does it?
UNK_UNK alright it just seems like we may have trouble getting past 1.23 FOS
UNK_UNK Can you set the piston bore diameter to 85 and get a good fos?
UNK_UNK 1.8 to 4.72, I'm currently at 2.14 but can drop to 1.96 without loosing too much fos
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK increasing D gives me a worse weight
UNK_UNK try changing your other values?
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK piston guy controls it
UNK_UNK how does diameter affect your part?
UNK_UNK The highest performance is at 3.91 FOS and 5.2M
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK no worries
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK update back to very good
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK Any way to increase FOS?
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK Good
UNK_UNK yeah agreed
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK mine is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK and i adjust the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK If you need to increase up to 42 thats possible
UNK_UNK lol
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK we are at "Good" now
UNK_UNK does the bore diameter D effect ur numbers?
UNK_UNK 2.36
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK the one that is currently broadcasted is 6.92. Thats the max i can get
UNK_UNK Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
UNK_UNK yeah we are less than 3 but the fos is still .59, yikes
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK that makes sense
UNK_UNK Ok my mass is down to 0.83 and my FOS is 5.82
UNK_UNK FOS is good. Mass is 10kg too high
UNK_UNK What would you like?
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK FOS is back i increased thickness
UNK_UNK im not sure if everyone is on board.
UNK_UNK 2
UNK_UNK so i could have us lose some weight but that is if you can room for imporvement on your FOS
UNK_UNK okay we might need to increase your
UNK_UNK the broadcasted values of 2.31 and 1.4
UNK_UNK yeah i cant change anything. We done?
UNK_UNK Increasing that will allow my factor of safety to increase. Any reason we're keeping it low?
UNK_UNK however i can bring it all the way down to 40 and still have a fos of 2.7
UNK_UNK minimize it if you can while keeping fos as close to 2 as possible
UNK_UNK I need to change D to 85 though
UNK_UNK if we can do that it cuts my mass to 1.24
UNK_UNK its fine now
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod lenth and the crank lenth
UNK_UNK Can I have a current value of D
UNK_UNK can you get that FOS up?
UNK_UNK For just the flywheel?
UNK_UNK increasing your the bearing offset only reduces the FOS so im keeping it at 150
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK 45
UNK_UNK what mass are you using?
UNK_UNK oh okay, sounds good
UNK_UNK Yeah really
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK Someone needs to broadcast their best mass so itll go down
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting new values?
UNK_UNK yeah one sec
UNK_UNK Im using .8 and .55 for r2 and r3
UNK_UNK same sounds good
UNK_UNK 5.75 @ 75
UNK_UNK we can optimize c and tf looks like
UNK_UNK you said piston diameter is in your equation right?
UNK_UNK unless you change that at all?
UNK_UNK *of mass
UNK_UNK I was going to start out with 70. Can you provide the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK Right now I'm using D = 85
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK thickness = 10
UNK_UNK 3.62
UNK_UNK My outputs. Global is 34.35 and 0.81
UNK_UNK i updated
UNK_UNK same and im currently there
UNK_UNK what is your fos now?
UNK_UNK mine are piston diameter and head thickness
UNK_UNK we did hit both requirements at one point
UNK_UNK We have some wiggle room in our mass now, I can try adjusting my thicknesses and see if that helps 
UNK_UNK looks like mass dropped a lot
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK f_os = 9193.31
UNK_UNK 0.28
UNK_UNK Sorry 60
UNK_UNK dang that fos is low
UNK_UNK thanks!
UNK_UNK Hey
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK Ok cool
UNK_UNK piston is0.91
UNK_UNK hmm
UNK_UNK I think my part and yours are doing fine
UNK_UNK what diam are you using
UNK_UNK what really?
UNK_UNK i have control over neither, only c and dc
UNK_UNK sweet!
UNK_UNK As of right now, I'm comfortable around 85 for my diameter, but that may need to be lowered to lower the overall mass
UNK_UNK right now my mass is at .69 and my FS is 3.84
UNK_UNK so raising c increases mass and reduces fos
UNK_UNK I'm thinking larger D makes my part heavier
UNK_UNK we need it to be higher than 2
UNK_UNK wait what
UNK_UNK so connector rod is 600
UNK_UNK can you change it to 150?
UNK_UNK DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
UNK_UNK Ok I also broadcast my best, it gives good weight and fs
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK great, done then
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK how much does your fos increase though? because then we could save mass in other parts
UNK_UNK 2.83
UNK_UNK I'm at fair quality. FOS is a bit low, total weight is a good amount under what it needs to be though
UNK_UNK Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
UNK_UNK Ok thanks
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK with my current dimensions mass is 1.2 and FOS is 15886.04
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK I am at the time we got the best result now
UNK_UNK do it
UNK_UNK i can decrease diameter
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS
UNK_UNK i can decrase on the weight but the FOS wouldn't meet requirement
UNK_UNK how much mass is your part?
UNK_UNK so close
UNK_UNK we reached good
UNK_UNK yea
UNK_UNK How does changing D affect your FOS?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK I can set the piston bore diameter at either 40, 47.5, 55, 62.5, and 70
UNK_UNK What are your mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK We need to save weight
UNK_UNK yea
UNK_UNK mine is 0.14 which is highest for my lowest mass option
UNK_UNK It is
UNK_UNK haha yea fingers crossed it stays at very good
UNK_UNK ok with the results
UNK_UNK could yo slightly lower your diamter again?
UNK_UNK I decreased my weight parameter a bit
UNK_UNK we only need it to be above 2
UNK_UNK try that
UNK_UNK and t_h, which may be the length
UNK_UNK I can change diameter if needed
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK what mass do you have for the flywheel?
UNK_UNK Sorry, t is section thickness and r is ratio of connecting rod length to crank length.
UNK_UNK depends
UNK_UNK mine are piston diameter and head thickness
UNK_UNK What is your third field you fill out to run simulations?
UNK_UNK But it's back to poor now again
UNK_UNK check for broadcast
UNK_UNK though I might switch to 75
UNK_UNK Who is this?
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK okay, you and rod designer want smaller while crankshaft wants larger
UNK_UNK I reduced mine to the lowest value, and our FOS is good now
UNK_UNK go back to what we had for Fair is you made changes
UNK_UNK yay
UNK_UNK we got it, don't change things
UNK_UNK Design variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK 7X7 fun
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK very close now
UNK_UNK why isnt this exxcellent
UNK_UNK below 45 weight and above 2 fos for auto engine design
UNK_UNK did you  broadcast your value?
UNK_UNK yeah we were over 2 about a minute ago
UNK_UNK i didnt touvch anything
UNK_UNK yes.  i think so
UNK_UNK WHO THE HELL KEEPS MOVING IT TO POOR
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK group: who wants to go next?
UNK_UNK Im at diameter = 52.5 and thickness = 35
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK i haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK reply when done
UNK_UNK What is your range for diameter?
UNK_UNK 2.42
UNK_UNK lets just try getting our mass down
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK I'll check in with you on that in a sec
UNK_UNK they don't wanna give us 20 bucks
UNK_UNK piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
UNK_UNK r2=0.5 r3=0.5 with D=41
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK okay, what mass are you at!
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK did I?
UNK_UNK mass is .13 and fos is 3.1
UNK_UNK I got fos 2.36
UNK_UNK are your masses high
UNK_UNK Did you make sure that the broadcast that you are sending matches with the designers that you are sharing data with?
UNK_UNK Who changed?
UNK_UNK anyways ya ive given up on 375 but imma hang out in Hess's office starting next week
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK but the far right column is the projected values for them and I think the ideal broadcast is the one with the best projected values
UNK_UNK and we are just trying to optimize somehow?
UNK_UNK i didnt change
UNK_UNK I'm trying to keep dc as alow as possible to save on mass
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK variable that affects my mass and fos is just diameter, so I've been minimizing my "outputs" on that diameter
UNK_UNK all good
UNK_UNK i think so, I think i just figured out what i need to do. I was confused at first
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK we havent added it yet
UNK_UNK What is the lower limit of your weight range?
UNK_UNK *meant, I apologize
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK bearing offset
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK what is your current diameter size
UNK_UNK The greater the values for either of those, the greater the FOS and mass
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK Can you see if you increase your bore diamater to 41 or 42 if it improves anything?
UNK_UNK it does increase my FOS
UNK_UNK before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
UNK_UNK I see it
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK 75 gives me 2.6kg and 8.08Fos which I think is pretty good
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK I do the control ds but its the same
UNK_UNK were in good range rn
UNK_UNK Also, do you have an idea for the thickness value? Or an assumed value I should begin with?
UNK_UNK does it affect your design much? If I increase it to 60 it will only increase my mass by like0.3
UNK_UNK my turn
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK I've changed the diameter to 53 to try to help with your factor of safety
UNK_UNK What's a good working piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK New plan. All of us are going to max FOS, and then worry about mass
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK Hi, what have you decided for the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK nevermind I'm being stupid
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK Yes, with that my FOS is now 2.17
UNK_UNK DONT CHANGE
UNK_UNK diamater is 90
UNK_UNK that's big
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK yes, they are active
UNK_UNK or is it each case by case for each part ?
UNK_UNK Im at the lowest possible on my sim list
UNK_UNK I can get mine up to 3.44 max where D = 40
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK We are good on FOS, but we need to lower our mass!
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK and i have an offset of 150 so if that changed let me know
UNK_UNK i changed to excellent
UNK_UNK currenty 2.03, but that can be raised.
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK so that seems too big
UNK_UNK check what you have now, piston changed 
UNK_UNK its 2700
UNK_UNK thats bonkers
UNK_UNK I think that will be the crankshaft!
UNK_UNK When you broadcast, does that just update the overall model with the design you selected for your subsystem?
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized
UNK_UNK Just D
UNK_UNK ill try decreasing my mass slightly
UNK_UNK im not sure
UNK_UNK X X O ; _ O _ ; _ O _
UNK_UNK cZ i was gonna try 80
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK Yeah it is either him or the flywheel
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK lets try that
UNK_UNK how did the mass go up
UNK_UNK My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
UNK_UNK No at most ill change it by 10, how much would a diameter of 50 affect your mass and FOS
UNK_UNK Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
UNK_UNK before uploading any new broadcasts copy and paste a message into all your chats so we know its changing
UNK_UNK q1: is it smaller than a microwave?
UNK_UNK i have set it to those values
UNK_UNK 20.86
UNK_UNK how's your FOS looking
UNK_UNK what's the diameter you're using?
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK I could try
UNK_UNK Change it back to a run with a FoS greater than 2
UNK_UNK we just bumped up top fair
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK nope!
UNK_UNK I had fos 1.35 and m=0.93 in that run
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK or reduced offset i should say
UNK_UNK I see 2.73
UNK_UNK Mass is now 0.1
UNK_UNK great, thanks!
UNK_UNK I think both of us are good
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK Our mass just increased a lot
UNK_UNK I haven't touched anything for a while
UNK_UNK Try to optimize your FoS to mass ratio in the mean time. I think that's how we'll be able to get good numbers
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK What is the current value of the bore?
UNK_UNK since we are at the threshold for fs
UNK_UNK wont let me
UNK_UNK Do you have a good flywheel diameter and flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK is*
UNK_UNK I believe FOS of 2.31
UNK_UNK No, do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK yes, piston bore is 80
UNK_UNK i know
UNK_UNK I am working on setting the thickness of the I section of the connecting rod and the Conrod length to crank length ratio. What about you?
UNK_UNK Right. Got mine to mass = 1.01, and fos = 2.03
UNK_UNK basically I'm never selecting an FS below 2
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, if you are in charge of the piston bore diameter, I got these values by setting D = 45 
UNK_UNK I asked the TA and he said mine is different than other parts
UNK_UNK What is your current mass at?
UNK_UNK crankshaft guy has fos of 0.57 we should see what he needs.
UNK_UNK Hit update broadcast if you havent yet I just found out that is important
UNK_UNK then it was not me
UNK_UNK I didnt
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK mas is up pretty high
UNK_UNK Current settings seem to just hit the min values, seems like a good reference point. (all)
UNK_UNK i agree, another component needs to be slimmed down, currently broadcasting my lowest values for both thickness and diameter
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK If the piston engineer increases bore diameter we can increase our FOS
UNK_UNK Piston pin too
UNK_UNK okay we got excellent. we should be done here
UNK_UNK It's the same tradeoff for everyone
UNK_UNK whats it to u
UNK_UNK aight
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK Its at 2.83 rn for me
UNK_UNK Nope things changed to the worst now
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK Need to increase FOS
UNK_UNK was that you?
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK you?
UNK_UNK FOS = 2, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you. That is the highest FOS I have found
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK fos_s: 1653.92;
UNK_UNK 43 or lower for fos greater than 2
UNK_UNK i think this is a trap
UNK_UNK i broadcasted my best
UNK_UNK Our FOS was at like 2.5 and mass was at 44. Not sure what changed but it all just went down a ton.
UNK_UNK How about we don't change anything and let one person run simulations at a time
UNK_UNK Will experiment
UNK_UNK What is your D?
UNK_UNK let's change one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK I control the diameter of the piston head and the thickness of the piston head
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK hey, Im seeing the Thickness of flywheel to be 10 mm, is this what you got?
UNK_UNK also reducing c significantly reduces the FOS
UNK_UNK How does the bearing support offset affect your part?
UNK_UNK Alright.
UNK_UNK no 25 is the highest it goes...
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK Is higher or lower D better for you?
UNK_UNK at a bore diameter of 45 i don't think there's anything I can do. I'm going to play around with bore diameter to see if that helps
UNK_UNK yall stay at where you are
UNK_UNK Yea our dimensions line up then
UNK_UNK 7.4
UNK_UNK pistons mass is 0.52 with a fos of 2.01
UNK_UNK :(
UNK_UNK need: piston bore diamter
UNK_UNK The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK I haven't it increases mass and decreases FOS so unless somebody needs it to change it doesn't make sense on my end
UNK_UNK no one change anything
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK no lol
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Not sure. I didn't change anything. I let all the others know
UNK_UNK I've got 2 of my own variables
UNK_UNK thats the pistonpin i think. rn i have piston diameter of 90
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK your individual mass?
UNK_UNK We're close, guys
UNK_UNK What do you mean? 0.52 is my minimum mass
UNK_UNK get you factor of safety as close to 2
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK its as low as itll go
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK What are the weight and FOS ranges for your part? Mine are .12 to 3.85 kg, 2  to 60 for FOS. Sending to everyone
UNK_UNK Oh okay. Im trying to figure out what inputs I can get from people on the team
UNK_UNK whats your fos at for current settings
UNK_UNK it says excellent for me
UNK_UNK Mine are flywheel thickness (tf) and flywheel shaft diameter (ds)
UNK_UNK Thanks, I'm good on my end. Is there anything you need from my end?
UNK_UNK It's all good now. Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS >2 ?
UNK_UNK I am simply sitting here
UNK_UNK dc at 45
UNK_UNK Not sure where the mass increase came from
UNK_UNK what is the mass of your system?
UNK_UNK Is 40 the best value you have found for D
UNK_UNK also just realized that you and i are gonna have to figure out the quiz alone bc anisah left
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK everyone try to lower the fos  to 2 but above 2
UNK_UNK What factors are you interested in?
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK Making the thickness larger increases mass but reduces factory of safety while decreasing diameter increases both
UNK_UNK yes, let's do one component each! keep the mass within .5 kg of the lowest value, and try to maximize FOS
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK my mass is minimized rn
UNK_UNK I change it to 80 now
UNK_UNK Great - let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK did any mass values change?
UNK_UNK hey i think that made things better!
UNK_UNK Thanks for checking in but I am all set in terms of needed values. Is there anything on my end I should send over?
UNK_UNK or we were for a second
UNK_UNK for mass?
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK we have time
UNK_UNK make sure to reduce weight and keep fos at 2
UNK_UNK and see
UNK_UNK can you try increasing ds?
UNK_UNK do you think lower diameter will give you a higher fos?
UNK_UNK do you know what's going on?
UNK_UNK Yeah the piston bore
UNK_UNK so i think the biggest thing for you is thickness - try and find the a thickness with low mass but high FOS
UNK_UNK I am in charge of doing that through piston diameter and piston head thickness. What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK I didn't change anything, still at c=150 and dc=45
UNK_UNK ok yeah so really small. I was just wondering why mass was so high
UNK_UNK its piston pin designer
UNK_UNK i just clicked broadcast
UNK_UNK yeah it sucked
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK and Thickness of the flywheel
UNK_UNK I control connnecting rod thickness and length, but depend on the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK our factor of safety went down
UNK_UNK tf = 12
UNK_UNK what values are you at
UNK_UNK we're good now
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK I put mine to initial values and the FOS is good now
UNK_UNK 85 seems good for now, testing my own combinations
UNK_UNK min weight : 0.5kg, max weight : 1.61 kg
UNK_UNK We  had fair a minute ago, who has been making changes? I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK actually we should be getting excellent
UNK_UNK nope, haven't broadcasted in a bit. The most I can change the wieght is by like 3 anyways
UNK_UNK i'm asking around rn
UNK_UNK so close
UNK_UNK Oh ok mine just updated
UNK_UNK Hi! I just wanted to reach out and make sure you did not need anything from me
UNK_UNK heloooo
UNK_UNK Looks good. I am at 2.03 and 0.05 = m
UNK_UNK can you increase it to around 2 or 3
UNK_UNK I mean, its a flywheel so it likely shouldnt be experiencing many loads. So that's normal.
UNK_UNK okay one sec
UNK_UNK if I change it to 75, will it affect your design
UNK_UNK just changed diameter to 80 and got FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK I'm good, thanks
UNK_UNK You have a lot of parameters to change, so try and run as many simulations as possible to try and find the sweet spot of mass and FOS
UNK_UNK do you have any parameters that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK yeah. i dont think i can change diameter because it will affect everyone
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK whats the name of the diameter?
UNK_UNK thickness is 10
UNK_UNK this looks like some weird morse code
UNK_UNK sorry
UNK_UNK Did you change anything?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK one is Input piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio
UNK_UNK Alright, I know that increasing it hurts the piston-pin design, so I will slightly increase and we can see what happens
UNK_UNK nah its above 35
UNK_UNK LOWER YOUR FOS
UNK_UNK We need to meet at least one of these criteria
UNK_UNK I control piston diameter and piston head thickness
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK But my mass is like 0.9
UNK_UNK I think there is but I don't know how.
UNK_UNK Yep just got paid
UNK_UNK great!!
UNK_UNK Hi :)
UNK_UNK Do what you need to do to get FoS > 1.5 and then we can adjust masses from there
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK I broadcasted something but then i changed it now
UNK_UNK Ok now it dropped
UNK_UNK Sounds great to me
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm upto 2.62 now. But remember, its the minimum of all the FOS that matters the most.
UNK_UNK mine is showing as poor right now
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK let me know what the new diameter is
UNK_UNK I think we can keep going
UNK_UNK Hi,I dont think I need parameters from you. 
UNK_UNK 1.2
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK just wait it out
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK on my screen it says quality is excellent
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK I am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK are you making any changes  ?
UNK_UNK i will stick with 47
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK Great
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK try to find a combo that gets you just above 2 fos but the lowest mass
UNK_UNK i didnt change anything
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK I changed fos but not the diamter
UNK_UNK Yeah I've taken that as low as possible without completely ruining fos, we also need to raise that
UNK_UNK mine's still showing 80
UNK_UNK 1.62 kg
UNK_UNK They asked and I gave them 40mm. I reached out to ask if I needed to change anything to help them, and they have not responded
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK If I increase the Piston Diameter, how much will it affect your FOS
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK yea our values are horrible
UNK_UNK a little someone else is messing around with their fos
UNK_UNK yeah that makes sense
UNK_UNK try 41.25 for t_f and 45 for diameter
UNK_UNK 15886.04
UNK_UNK Do you need information about flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK you good if we start with a smaller bore diameter of 45? if that doesn't work we can increase it
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK HEllo
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK reduced to 150
UNK_UNK I have around 10
UNK_UNK it got worse so i would change it back
UNK_UNK My sheet says piston bore diameter but it's not a variable that I control.
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass currently without making fos poor
UNK_UNK Like now
UNK_UNK What bore diameter are you choosing?
UNK_UNK Yeah we just need mass to go down
UNK_UNK crankshaft is 2.11 but they say they cant decrease it anymore
UNK_UNK they said they didnt change it
UNK_UNK Are your values finalized? I see we are at excellent now.
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK Currently I think the mass is too much.
UNK_UNK at some point. need to get mass down
UNK_UNK good
UNK_UNK let me check real quick
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK i waaaaaant mooooney
UNK_UNK Wait are we using D = 85 or 75?
UNK_UNK mas- 1.23 fos- 12.2k
UNK_UNK report weight
UNK_UNK what are your values currently at?
UNK_UNK for mass
UNK_UNK It seems like if flyweel thickness and diameter are the same, but crankshaft bearing offset is reduced then mass stays the same but fos is reduced
UNK_UNK What is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK we are at fair
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK Global requirements top of page
UNK_UNK _I_I_
UNK_UNK all good
UNK_UNK Thats great, let's see how those parameters can affect the possibilities with other sub systems
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK What piston bore diameter are you using?
UNK_UNK ya, try 75
UNK_UNK Hold where you are
UNK_UNK I think you could decrease mass bc FOS only needs to be above 2
UNK_UNK can you reduce is closer to 2 while decreasing mass?
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK shoot
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK see if you can change the oiston bore diamter to lower
UNK_UNK Ah I see
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK Well I think each individual part needs a FOS greater than 2
UNK_UNK That's pretty minimal
UNK_UNK overall fos is decreawseing
UNK_UNK i didnt
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK my lowest fos is 1.46, max is 31.19
UNK_UNK completely
UNK_UNK I am at about 0.11
UNK_UNK okay sounds good
UNK_UNK im pretty sure a factor of safety less than 1 is a guaranteed fail
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK this is what i ahve rn
UNK_UNK also which FS are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK piston told me
UNK_UNK whats your fos now?
UNK_UNK I don't think it's piston
UNK_UNK I will change to 70
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK that was with r2 at .5, r3 at.7 and D at 40
UNK_UNK dont change anything hahah
UNK_UNK We do not have a crank engineer or con rod engineer.
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK no we should go for excellent
UNK_UNK group:ok we need to reduce weight a lot
UNK_UNK going with the minimum to reduce mass because my FOS is so high
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK piston pin has ds
UNK_UNK is bore diameter piston diameter
UNK_UNK It is updated. That's my current broadcast.
UNK_UNK ill ask
UNK_UNK okay now weight is down, but FOS is a tad too low
UNK_UNK for my part or the whole thing?
UNK_UNK we are at excellent again
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK What about you
UNK_UNK dont change anything
UNK_UNK What were the values?
UNK_UNK I can adjust thickness to have a required FOS at a specific D
UNK_UNK for both fos and mass?
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK Hey looks like our FOS went up. What changed?
UNK_UNK What are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK what can we do to increase your FOS?
UNK_UNK my FOS is best at 40, making it larger decreases my FOS
UNK_UNK Piston bore diamteter
UNK_UNK Idk if we have certain rounds or not
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK 2.77
UNK_UNK Currently 3.2
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK We had a very good one at 80 before
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Ok 60 is my lowest possible so I'll leave it at that
UNK_UNK Okay
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK Global quality looking bad though
UNK_UNK What is your current mass?
UNK_UNK Is your piston pin the same as the crankshaft-pin?
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK thats as low as I have gotten it
UNK_UNK I can control t1 and r1, let me know if you would like me to change it to see how it effects your numbers.
UNK_UNK What variables/equations do you deal with?
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK what is your current ds
UNK_UNK bore diameter
UNK_UNK I'm ending it
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK should we try 85 for dia?
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK I am not the one who ran it to get verygood
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK its actually at the minimum
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK gotcha, try 85 then
UNK_UNK yup. will do ;(
UNK_UNK Yeah I just altered the thickness to try to save mass
UNK_UNK #ERROR!
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK I think that doing that effects the other designs as well
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK Hopefully they saved their values for the very good design.
UNK_UNK i think so
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK tf of 10 and ds of 15 is the lowest mass I can get
UNK_UNK mine is 29
UNK_UNK D = 80 not 90
UNK_UNK good job team
UNK_UNK Whats your fos?
UNK_UNK I think a tf value of 10 is best
UNK_UNK now we are at very good
UNK_UNK Didn't change anything. We need to decrease mass
UNK_UNK tf increases mass...
UNK_UNK wait, can you reduce the mass
UNK_UNK For better or worse. want me to change mine and see how it affects yours real quick
UNK_UNK alright, guess not then
UNK_UNK sure!, I'm trying to play with c to get a higher FOS
UNK_UNK We need just a hair less mass
UNK_UNK Group: no more changes!
UNK_UNK i control pistonpin length to diameter ratio and piston pinn inner diameter to outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK so for me besides diameter, i can play around with two variables
UNK_UNK Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK nice work
UNK_UNK It should be our lowest FS, but it's 0.51 instead of 2
UNK_UNK Yes that is what I have input
UNK_UNK Yea. I am working with my numbers to try and fix that.
UNK_UNK flywheel guy has his stuff firgured out
UNK_UNK try not to change anything until you talk to someone
UNK_UNK what's your current piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK m=0.07 FOS=1.23
UNK_UNK If you need the offset to be higher let me know.
UNK_UNK Does a piston diameter of 85 work well for you?
UNK_UNK Sorry, I think my mass is 1.5
UNK_UNK Sorry for the abrupt message. I saw that we got excellent and didn't want to lose it
UNK_UNK i mistyped D = 80
UNK_UNK ok cause I have lowest fos so ill fail first meaning overall fos depends on me
UNK_UNK increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK 1.3 kg so not really
UNK_UNK I'll be on it
UNK_UNK ok will try some other variations
UNK_UNK GROUP: ok I see piston-pin, that works too
UNK_UNK that massive dip did not come from piston
UNK_UNK alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
UNK_UNK yeahh after last exam its been rough haha so thats probably a good idea
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK my value has been the same as well thanks for the update
UNK_UNK We've got a "Good" engine
UNK_UNK Let me know if you change the bearing offset
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK sweet, ill update my FOS
UNK_UNK ok youre the minimum
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK impressive
UNK_UNK Check for broadcast now
UNK_UNK Ok great
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK what is your diameter at currently?
UNK_UNK good working with ya
UNK_UNK What do you currently have for your bore diameter?
UNK_UNK I'm fine with that
UNK_UNK can you share your variable letters (what you control and what you need)
UNK_UNK If we increase the diameter we go over the weight limit
UNK_UNK who's fos changed
UNK_UNK 3.64
UNK_UNK We need to increase fos
UNK_UNK c and dc
UNK_UNK hey, just wondering, what are your inputs? 
UNK_UNK Rod designer still here
UNK_UNK oh for sure
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK We did
UNK_UNK the $20 we just won
UNK_UNK howeffect on mass
UNK_UNK ok so it probably changes mass a lot and we can try improve fos some with other parts
UNK_UNK bueno
UNK_UNK our crankshaft person isnt communicating with me, can you try and get them to talk to me :( I need to discuss values with them
UNK_UNK one sec
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better to use greater value because 40mm is the minimum value
UNK_UNK whats the corresponding fos?
UNK_UNK group - same with piston-pin
UNK_UNK I can increase that and lower the weight but that is if you could cover on FOS
UNK_UNK Is there anything you can do to reduce mass without changing fos much?
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK 2.01
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK do we have a pistonpin ? because no one is answering me
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK Is there a way to lower that? Mass is way too high and FOS too low
UNK_UNK Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
UNK_UNK Where is your FOS at?
UNK_UNK I just got my FOS up to 9
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK yep, we need to lower the overall mass
UNK_UNK to simulate
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK lets leave it like this
UNK_UNK has the bore diameter updated?
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK _IXI_
UNK_UNK Perfect
UNK_UNK ok sounds good
UNK_UNK do you rely on a c or a dc?
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK U mean 0.672?
UNK_UNK Maybe. not sure if it was you or me or someone else who messed it up
UNK_UNK 2.85
UNK_UNK I have an fos of 1.45 now, I'll try increasing the diameter
UNK_UNK If i increase diameter we go over weight. Still on lowest setting
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK No, I believe my variables are independent of shaft diameter
UNK_UNK Whichever works best for you
UNK_UNK just changed it to 25 d and t is 10
UNK_UNK if anyone touches our design, im gonna beat $10 out of them
UNK_UNK Let me know what you decide
UNK_UNK yeah i have the same questionb
UNK_UNK The only person that hasn't responded regarding the change is rod designer
UNK_UNK it seems so, yet we are still over the mass limit?
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK My part has a lot of weight so anything to reduce weight would help
UNK_UNK check for a broadcast maybe?
UNK_UNK Literally, there is not
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK what numbers are u running
UNK_UNK because mine still read as excellent when my diameter was at 80
UNK_UNK space
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK Ok, try reducing the diameter to 45 and see what happens
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK frick my mass is 57
UNK_UNK no have not plugged in any new values
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK we are at excellent
UNK_UNK I know, but the weight is higher for my other options above 2
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK i still have my two best broadcasted
UNK_UNK minimize the mass of crankshaft and maximize fos
UNK_UNK also i forgot fos is just the minimum value not an average
UNK_UNK *your
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK no, that gives me an Fos of 0.51. My mass is at most 0.12 so there's not much to be gained for reducing it but Fos drops quickly
UNK_UNK so why is our tital so low?
UNK_UNK we spent lab tuesday trying to get it to go forward
UNK_UNK im talking about your indidivudal part
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK Mine has an FOS of 2.42
UNK_UNK idk
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK 5625.56
UNK_UNK hmm Crankshaft is saying to drop mass by .28
UNK_UNK it's corrected now
UNK_UNK It's up
UNK_UNK I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK Don't change it!
UNK_UNK Ok cool. Do you need any values from me?
UNK_UNK Crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK I didn't change
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK ok run again with values when you were getting good
UNK_UNK OK STOP
UNK_UNK I'll try lowering my mass some
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK Preston
UNK_UNK For D = 75 and D = 85, what are the minimum masses you can have for a FOS of 2?
UNK_UNK look at the chart on the last page of your booklet, we are shooting for the highest FOS and lowest mass
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK Ok. Crankshaft bearing offset: 150.0, Crankshaft-pin diameter: 50.0.
UNK_UNK r2 and r3
UNK_UNK increase it to 50
UNK_UNK not me
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK Does a large or small flywheel mass benefit you? do you know?
UNK_UNK i have the fos at 2.85 and m as 6.26
UNK_UNK I'm now at 2.77, all my numbers are at their minimum 
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK 24.3 at m = .75
UNK_UNK You have to update your broadcast and look at the total FOS and mass
UNK_UNK 2.47
UNK_UNK im assuming these are horizontal
UNK_UNK what is your Fos and mass?
UNK_UNK like one part has huge FS so they just minimized mass bc the part has FS over 100 no matter what option they choose
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK that's at my minimum dimensions, I can't
UNK_UNK I have thickness as 12 and diameter as 60
UNK_UNK What is ds?
UNK_UNK I'll ask them
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK lmaaaooooo
UNK_UNK yeet
UNK_UNK try bearing offset = 180, crankshaft pin is 35 mm
UNK_UNK my goal is to minimize the crankshaft weight and maximize fos
UNK_UNK require: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK do you need my rod cross section to increase?
UNK_UNK What are your values for diameter and thickness right now
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK so do you have variable called r2 and r3?
UNK_UNK my masses are very small, and FS are 0.4-3.44
UNK_UNK what variable can you change  for "change variables of other sub-systems?"
UNK_UNK they just not responding to messages?
UNK_UNK don't change
UNK_UNK okay now we're better lol - idk what happened
UNK_UNK Nevermind, global changed to 55.36 and 2.03
UNK_UNK Is there any way you can reduce D?
UNK_UNK so, currently where are we with Fos?
UNK_UNK who is in charge of piston pin
UNK_UNK my connecting rod length = 1/(crank length)
UNK_UNK I'm guessing the crankshaft. the piston is .55 and the piston pin is 0.06
UNK_UNK but mine is flywheel, wont get any lower
UNK_UNK Optimize Fos first then mass?
UNK_UNK 45=1.7, 48=1.15
UNK_UNK What is your fos?
UNK_UNK Maybe ask around
UNK_UNK I updated to the values that gave me m = 0.52 and fs = 2.0 and have not since
UNK_UNK Let me know what flywheel thicknesses and flywheel shaft diamters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
UNK_UNK k
UNK_UNK The mass is our biggest issue
UNK_UNK Thanks!
UNK_UNK decreasing diameter will decrease my factor of safety
UNK_UNK rip too late
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK r2 and r3 of the piston pin
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK Maybe? My pin length is called l1 (el 1) and I also control the inner and outer diameter of the pin (d0 and di)
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK still 45
UNK_UNK the closest FOS I have above 2 is 3.78. I'll try broadcasting it
UNK_UNK Hello, what is the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK seems like it
UNK_UNK I can bump up FOS by like 2 for every 0.2g of mass I add. We just need to get the rest of the mass down
UNK_UNK you're going to keep it at 80?
UNK_UNK ds-60
UNK_UNK Where is your FOS at?
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK now we are at poor again...
UNK_UNK What value of the piston diameter should I use?
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK Smallest number possible is best
UNK_UNK flywheel unchanged @ 0.52 kg and FOS 1215
UNK_UNK I just try 75
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK Ok cause I have the option to increase weight by .15 while also increasing fos by .65
UNK_UNK i have a fos of 2.47
UNK_UNK so ds doesn't make a difference for my fos
UNK_UNK No, I have two of my own variables
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK what are your current values for mass and fos?
UNK_UNK At max FOS
UNK_UNK Dont change!!
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK 0.86
UNK_UNK my mass values range from 1.13 to 3.12
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK yes, do you need that changed?
UNK_UNK someone changed thier mass
UNK_UNK 2.26 and 2.5
UNK_UNK ok ill leave then
UNK_UNK i dropped 1 kg with 3 fos
UNK_UNK 0.53 is the mass of my piston currently
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK don't change the broadcast, but if you simulate a minim weight situation, what's the savings?
UNK_UNK 1.64
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK try raising it back up a bit and see what happens
UNK_UNK Does the crank-pin diameter affect your part?
UNK_UNK at bore diameter of 40
UNK_UNK I can try
UNK_UNK tell me if it's better for you if I use greater value
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK I am thinking 82.5 which is the second smallest
UNK_UNK 2.03 for fos
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK 4 for head thickness and 75 for piston diameter
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to while considering what piston did
UNK_UNK I have mass at 0.14 and Fos at 2.6 currently for my component, what are you looking at?
UNK_UNK Only change something if it will lower mass and keep fs greater than 2
UNK_UNK Only the piston diameter D affects my part
UNK_UNK try to decrease mass while keeping FOS over 2
UNK_UNK *tho
UNK_UNK ya I need the piston to change the bore diameter so I can see how if effects my numbers
UNK_UNK My dimension?
UNK_UNK or is there anything else you control
UNK_UNK diameter D has been at 40 whole time
UNK_UNK pretty close now actually
UNK_UNK hmm that's weird
UNK_UNK ik lol
UNK_UNK whats your fos
UNK_UNK you?
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK FOS is just whoever has the lowest value
UNK_UNK crankshaft hit the wrong button that is why i think it went back to poor
UNK_UNK No one is updating broadcast
UNK_UNK i guess still just try and get it as high as possible lol idk
UNK_UNK yes and I am also playing with my numbers because I just realized now what to do. I am still getting poor quality though
UNK_UNK yes, that's when it was excellent
UNK_UNK Does youyr part depend on my values?
UNK_UNK What are you working on?
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK What value do you intend to use for your crank-shaft offset?
UNK_UNK Hey, let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK sorry
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK or else the fos is very low
UNK_UNK im going to try to change it to get FOS higher and yeah I broadcasted
UNK_UNK makes sense, I'm checking with the others to see who is using the most mass
UNK_UNK 85 right now
UNK_UNK i can go lower but it'ss reduce fos
UNK_UNK Heaviest Ms: 3.64 Highest FS: 6.92
UNK_UNK Our factor of safety is greater than 2, which is excellent 
UNK_UNK No, you?
UNK_UNK ok Ill try that
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK currently 0.06
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK yeah I
UNK_UNK my design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter)))
UNK_UNK how does dc affect mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK Same. 40 is the way to go
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK Nvm I can see them
UNK_UNK how much does the mass of your part very (like the min vs max)?
UNK_UNK hey what are your values?
UNK_UNK getting close
UNK_UNK 17.5 would be great, lowers mass a ton
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK ggs
UNK_UNK how
UNK_UNK no my mass is 3.05 and my FOS is 2.02
UNK_UNK lowest mass is at D=40, changing it to that
UNK_UNK lets try that
UNK_UNK I'm not sure why they aren't updating though when I change my input values
UNK_UNK what is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK "This crankshaft is so broke I can hear it asking me for money"
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK 1.93 right now
UNK_UNK im trying to reduce the mass of the system without sacrificing too much of factor of safety
UNK_UNK mine also
UNK_UNK No, my FOS values are all greater than 300.
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK Don't know if this matters to you, but the connecting rod I section is 2 mm and the ratio of length between the connecting rod and crank length is 3
UNK_UNK i have one more setting before im at my lowest
UNK_UNK Interesting, the mass is what is hurting us but the FOS is beautifull
UNK_UNK broadcast that
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK lets play tic tac toe (give me a sec)
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK It has been staying that when I change things though soi maybe I'm doing something wrong
UNK_UNK lets do 62.5
UNK_UNK flyehweel thickness and flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK crankshaft is right next to me too lol
UNK_UNK I thought that the fos on top is our total global fos
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK Yes, I want to minimize mass but also don't want the piston head to fail
UNK_UNK Re-running with new numbers, give me one second
UNK_UNK I control tH and D of the piston
UNK_UNK Let's update eveyone with new m and FOS whenever we make changes
UNK_UNK Lets not change it now
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, try reducing the mass
UNK_UNK we finished now?
UNK_UNK diameter just updated back to 80
UNK_UNK someone changed thier mass
UNK_UNK I increased the bore diameter and that seemed to help the FOS
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK mine: ms 1.07, fos 35.82
UNK_UNK tH doesn't effect me, can you try decreasing D 
UNK_UNK thats the only reason i knew how to do hw prob3
UNK_UNK I told everyone that, but I think connector tod and piston pin guys left
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.12 which is the lowest value, and my FOS is (legit) 4706.97
UNK_UNK Yea, nvm we're good i think
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK well hold up, someone just pushed us back to Poor
UNK_UNK same lmao
UNK_UNK I asked the guy, he said it was normal
UNK_UNK Yeah flywheel isn't communicating
UNK_UNK actually mine is just as good with the diameter at 80, the fos is just a little lower at 2.3
UNK_UNK good point
UNK_UNK your specific results will be in the table under the charts
UNK_UNK also you can only see a few of the design variables, so whatever broadcast we had before was working well and this new one isn't as good
UNK_UNK Wasn't me
UNK_UNK fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK I have the lowest mass configuration (0.55), and the highest FOS (5625) setup currently. Unsure why the overall stats are poor at the moment. 
UNK_UNK 85 right now, I was trying to optimize mass
UNK_UNK However, I cannot do that because it's critical to the weight of piston
UNK_UNK Hello, what variables do you have control over?
UNK_UNK someone changed it again
UNK_UNK yup
UNK_UNK Just did
UNK_UNK holy cow someone is making major changes
UNK_UNK What is the bearing offset? it just says 60 and I don't know if you have changed it
UNK_UNK no only D
UNK_UNK im trying 90 mm
UNK_UNK the final isnt cumulative tho
UNK_UNK is it each part or globally
UNK_UNK Changing D from 40 to 70 lowers the FOS drastically like ~ 3.0 but lowers the mass just a bit like ~ 0.1kg
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK use thickness 10 and diameter 25 for now
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK My weight varies between 0.0 and 0.12 so im the wrong person to reduce weight
UNK_UNK Don't change it!
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK I see that c should be 60 is that what you have?
UNK_UNK but im stillsuspicious
UNK_UNK Awesome, thanks!
UNK_UNK that wasn't me/ I am trying to shave off that little bit
UNK_UNK Hey, is there any chance you could choose the setting that has the highest FOS and broadcast it?
UNK_UNK I think the global FOS is just the minimum value out of the 5 of us
UNK_UNK what current mass and fos do you have?
UNK_UNK to 150
UNK_UNK so let do the best design at 45
UNK_UNK greatjob
UNK_UNK good work
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.27 already
UNK_UNK I had an excellent quality, but with someone's new broadcast, it's not poor
UNK_UNK I remember the parameter I had
UNK_UNK We're at very good, I say we leave it at this
UNK_UNK that is the best I can get
UNK_UNK 1.12
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK my mass values range from 1.13 to 3.12
UNK_UNK My individual mass is 1.27
UNK_UNK is your design at the lowest possible weight?
UNK_UNK Minimize mass of connecting rod and maximize factor of safety against yielding due to buckling.
UNK_UNK for D = 85, min mass is 3.4
UNK_UNK what fos #s are you getting?
UNK_UNK The crankshaft designed is changing values
UNK_UNK ds tf and D
UNK_UNK yes, i design the c and dc
UNK_UNK okay okay
UNK_UNK most of mass is in piston and flywheel
UNK_UNK So what is your c value?
UNK_UNK fair, that mass is pretty low and the flywheel can increase FOS, I'll decrease mass
UNK_UNK i dont have 85, i have 82.5
UNK_UNK I am the flywheel, and would like to know about the "Crankshaft bearing offset" when you make a decision on it. 
UNK_UNK sheesh that's high, have you found a good sweet spot between mass and FOS?
UNK_UNK do you control D ds or tf?
UNK_UNK makes it way worse
UNK_UNK I will try that
UNK_UNK the smaller those two values are, the lighter the part is, but it gets weaker
UNK_UNK bro are you alive
UNK_UNK and a tH of 10.5
UNK_UNK yeah 0.09 isnt hot
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK but we have a good design
UNK_UNK I am working with 70 right now, but it will need adjusted.
UNK_UNK For the diameter, I think we should use 40
UNK_UNK ok cool
UNK_UNK I think you should try to lower your diameter to 45 or so and see what happens.
UNK_UNK cool thats good
UNK_UNK and then my system depends on 3 other variables
UNK_UNK yea lets not change any more variables
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK how about for fos
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK i tried 95
UNK_UNK those are the same for me. Can you see any other variables? I can only see those 4
UNK_UNK increases
UNK_UNK idk how but our mass earlier was 33.29 or something
UNK_UNK Do you have an idea of what value you're going to begin with for your bore diameter?
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK now im using diameter = 55 thickness 15
UNK_UNK higher tf is better for me
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out, it seems really large
UNK_UNK Hello my friend
UNK_UNK mass 1.66 fos 1.64
UNK_UNK i guess it's good
UNK_UNK Okay, I think I have control of L and r.
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK who is this?!
UNK_UNK might need to change something else
UNK_UNK what is your flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK Is your FS really low?
UNK_UNK Did your values just change?
UNK_UNK i havnt changed anything, my variables seem to be the best so far
UNK_UNK can you get the mass lower?
UNK_UNK sounds good but do you have any more room to reduce mass? I'm about the smallest I can make my parts
UNK_UNK Now it is 80
UNK_UNK In my simulation I increased Tf to 51. It brought the fos down ever so slightly, but brought down the mass by 2 kg for some reason
UNK_UNK design variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia, 
UNK_UNK Keep your FOS above 2
UNK_UNK did your mass just change a ton
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK it will say what you are controlling and what your measures are depending on
UNK_UNK still poor condition
UNK_UNK they updated it
UNK_UNK just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK 0.45 kg to 4.43
UNK_UNK 3.21
UNK_UNK I got my mass down to 0.10 i think that is as low as i can go and the factor of safety is still 2.77
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK right :(
UNK_UNK FOS/
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Ok sounds good
UNK_UNK I control the r values
UNK_UNK masses go from around 1 to 4
UNK_UNK Whoever just changed something about FOS change it back . It made it worse
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK oops sorry it's at 80
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK what is your mass when you maximize your flywheel diameter and thickness
UNK_UNK Ok, I don't think so either, but sent just in case
UNK_UNK did you change the mass?
UNK_UNK yea sure
UNK_UNK mass = 1.27 and f_os = 15886.04
UNK_UNK yeah they changed it back they doubled the diameter of the flywheel
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
UNK_UNK yes. with a mass of 0.1
UNK_UNK decrease urs now
UNK_UNK FS?
UNK_UNK but 1.33 isnt bad
UNK_UNK my highest mass option is .03 so it might be best for me to just use that and get our highest fos
UNK_UNK retweet
UNK_UNK 0.1-3.24
UNK_UNK 200 for offset works better for me
UNK_UNK q3: does it hav emoving parts
UNK_UNK what is your fos and mass?
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK I have piston-pin length and piston pin diameter, so let me know if youd like me to change any of those values
UNK_UNK that's not good. why did you tell me to increase the diameter?
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK we have excellent
UNK_UNK Same
UNK_UNK if you get it lower than 2.0, you can try adding some mass, it's ok.
UNK_UNK my FS is the minimum at 2.10 so anything we can do to reduce mass and stay above that FS is the last step
UNK_UNK whats your fos?
UNK_UNK What would you like the D to be?
UNK_UNK These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different D: 75: 5.45, 85: 6.72, 95: 8.08, 105: 9.56. These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different diameters
UNK_UNK lmao ya i noticed
UNK_UNK 6.45 now
UNK_UNK so I have two variables
UNK_UNK im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
UNK_UNK Mine only changes when yours change lol
UNK_UNK Hey if I increase D, will that help or hurt your design
UNK_UNK goal weight is actually 35
UNK_UNK make it higher
UNK_UNK hbu?
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK The piston can be any value between 3 and 15kg
UNK_UNK if you increase the diameter
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK now its 4.92
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK and see what happens
UNK_UNK ok back to very good i say leabe it
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting it?
UNK_UNK What is your mass?
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK The TA guy said its the lowest value between us
UNK_UNK at that, I can get m = 0.12 and FOS = 3.03 which are good values
UNK_UNK 80mm
UNK_UNK Yes, mass minimization is quite useless on my end, as my values are 0.02 - 0.12
UNK_UNK thickness is 10 and diameter is 22
UNK_UNK based on the little chart they gave us our design should be at excellent
UNK_UNK looks like we need to reduce mass and maintain FOS
UNK_UNK lets try 90
UNK_UNK about 12
UNK_UNK Hey, I need value of crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Can you do D =85?
UNK_UNK my mass is kinda less
UNK_UNK I think we should aim to increase fos in everyones system
UNK_UNK no boy we need both
UNK_UNK I don't think so, maybe try to find an fos closer to 2 and reduce the mass?
UNK_UNK Piston Bore I am currently working with is 55mm
UNK_UNK then i can toggle with my other parameter to make the best total mass and FOS
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK do you have a diameter that you feel comfortable working with?
UNK_UNK I think we are good if we get excellent maybe?
UNK_UNK mine only goes up to 30 max
UNK_UNK Are there any parameters from the flywheel that affect your factor of safety or mass of your sub system?
UNK_UNK do you control ds?
UNK_UNK We only need above 2, so try as must as you can to lower the mass
UNK_UNK No i do not!
UNK_UNK The current weight of my part is 0.1, so changing it won't affect it a whole lot.
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK 2.06
UNK_UNK m = 0.07 and fos = 1.59
UNK_UNK but you might have to reduce mass
UNK_UNK It's been good working with Yall
UNK_UNK A bit. I can lower bore diameter
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK group - what does your design depend on, and how does it change m and fos?
UNK_UNK lets get this bread
UNK_UNK whats the d and t values you
UNK_UNK my fos is 2
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK at excellent so dont change anything
UNK_UNK how about increasing fos?
UNK_UNK no ive checked
UNK_UNK Someone just changed something
UNK_UNK havent figured out the lowest yet but it should be around 1.15
UNK_UNK how much does the mass increase?
UNK_UNK we are tryin to cut down on mass right now
UNK_UNK piston pin had been able to hit FOS of 1 at one point, was usually below 1
UNK_UNK i know, if this were Hell's Kitchen I'd get gordon ramsay to yell at him lol
UNK_UNK I like it. I just broadcasted the parameter that has the highest FOS for my lowest possible weight
UNK_UNK I think so
UNK_UNK it doesnt impact it much, and my part is low mass so if i have to change it, that wont be a big deal
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK You could reduce the FOS value since they are looking for the component with the smallest FOS value
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK piston- pin designer
UNK_UNK ok. I have heard nothing from Crank Design
UNK_UNK currently 55 mm unless you think a better value could be used
UNK_UNK can u adjust ur thing to accomidate that?
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK flywheel guy was that you
UNK_UNK I have my values set at t(I) = 5.667 and r(1) = 4 with a FOS of 2.0 and an m(s) of 3.17 using piston bore diameter of 80.
UNK_UNK what is c?
UNK_UNK oh ok yeah neither can mine haha
UNK_UNK my current fos is .67 and I think it should be above one
UNK_UNK On it
UNK_UNK yeah, told him to reduce it to save some weight
UNK_UNK because if I go with 50, FOS would be too low
UNK_UNK check out my latest broadcast, that looks like the best I can do
UNK_UNK can you go to the minimum bore diameter real quick
UNK_UNK we're at excellent
UNK_UNK I'm on 0.69 now with a FOS of 3.84
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK Which gives lowest weight
UNK_UNK I don't understand
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK like i just wanna get this robot working and try to get the extra points for the competition
UNK_UNK if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK I have c and dc what do you control?
UNK_UNK im at 75
UNK_UNK Do you have control over D?
UNK_UNK fos = 2.36
UNK_UNK though i guess it's more efficient mass than the shaft
UNK_UNK close game
UNK_UNK then we can ask someone to decrease mass
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK try increasing your fos without increasing mass too much
UNK_UNK but were at v good
UNK_UNK Rolid, really solid
UNK_UNK ok let me see how that effects my design
UNK_UNK mass is 36.43kg
UNK_UNK tf-27
UNK_UNK Nevermind we getting there!
UNK_UNK what is the offset you have decided to use for the crannkshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK the simulation results for me show the subsystem fos
UNK_UNK whaddup
UNK_UNK Yeah they said they're not going to change it now
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK tf is 10
UNK_UNK its the flywheel guy
UNK_UNK for my parts
UNK_UNK what is the category?
UNK_UNK that's better than poor
UNK_UNK GROUP: crankshaft done, fos is great, mass needs just a little bit to bring into Very Good. piston goes next
UNK_UNK alright, let me find my  ideal values based on the 40
UNK_UNK we at very good rn im happy with that
UNK_UNK It seems like larger D increases my FOS
UNK_UNK ayyy the status is good somehow
UNK_UNK I am trying to change the piston thickness to reduce mass too
UNK_UNK ready?
UNK_UNK great thanks
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK yeah it can't be
UNK_UNK Do you need any parameters from me ?
UNK_UNK What value would be ideal for the flywheel?
UNK_UNK we can
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK rn is very
UNK_UNK we just sitting here relying on flywheel lol
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK Thanks :) I'll work with that for now, let me know if you end up making any final changes
UNK_UNK I think I optimized mine as well my mass is at 0.10 and fos is 2.77
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK Put your values to your lowest mass and highest FOS right now please!  I want to get an overall view of where we are
UNK_UNK dc?
UNK_UNK Thanks. What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK wow english
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK yes, 40
UNK_UNK Have you updated the global broadcast in a while?
UNK_UNK We're going in the wrong direction for both
UNK_UNK I need to know your crankshaft bearing offset value so tell me if you find anything good
UNK_UNK do you have an input i should try?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK i kinda wanna know who the other people are
UNK_UNK we should try a safe configuration and trim weight from there
UNK_UNK i don't believe piston diameter affects the flywheel at all
UNK_UNK Check the top of the second page of the handout
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest mass possible
UNK_UNK ok I change D right now its still 75
UNK_UNK should we try running with everyone at min range and see how it affects the overall
UNK_UNK no we need mass below 35
UNK_UNK My mass range is around 0.02 to .12
UNK_UNK $20 richer
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK We have bore diameter down to 55 now, it lets us get a bit lighter
UNK_UNK sorry 50 mm
UNK_UNK So your mass is the largest contributor by far, can we reduce that at all?
UNK_UNK im guessing flywheel
UNK_UNK but im strugling with mass
UNK_UNK but the weight incresases too
UNK_UNK idk i didnt change
UNK_UNK and D = 85
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK for your ouputs only?
UNK_UNK Someone is below 2
UNK_UNK We at fair. Good enough?
UNK_UNK thickness=2, ratio=3
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK Can you increase mass slightly?
UNK_UNK now the whole part is 3.86
UNK_UNK 37.49 kg and 2.06
UNK_UNK yeah its fine i jsut want $17
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK Alright. Do you have a value for the flywheel diameter?
UNK_UNK Wow that's pretty high. Bearing support offset and crank-pin diameter
UNK_UNK agreed, we can still try to look for improvements
UNK_UNK just lowered it another 2 lbs
UNK_UNK my current c i 150 and dc of 30
UNK_UNK what are you FS/Ms at rn?
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK yo
UNK_UNK minimized the mass because the flywheel is unlikely to fail
UNK_UNK Do you need a conrod length to crank length ratio?
UNK_UNK Flywheel guy is also in on it
UNK_UNK We've got a Good FoS now, just need to get mass down
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK i hope they read all this
UNK_UNK with a ratio of 4
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK what is your fs
UNK_UNK ok!
UNK_UNK What are your two variables at
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK ratio for piston pin length to piston diameter
UNK_UNK Ok. I can now get FOS of over 3 for .12 kg so it works well for me but if you need to change it I can try other settings
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK and increase FOS a decent amount
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK Great - thanks
UNK_UNK *back up 2
UNK_UNK 40~70
UNK_UNK 1.23
UNK_UNK piston is about to update me with D. I need it to be low too. How about you
UNK_UNK I don't think you need anything from me, do you?
UNK_UNK yeah thats ok the fos for othee's will be less
UNK_UNK great question, but it is all legitimate
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK maybe, I'll try to go back
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 2
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK maybe try and adjust again to find a balance
UNK_UNK are you still using 40 for the diameter?
UNK_UNK I have good for a design with thickness 10 and diameter 25
UNK_UNK For the one I just ran I got 2.62
UNK_UNK mine is as low as possible too. We cant all have minimum mass
UNK_UNK is this just a tolerance between the crankshaft bearing and flywheel?
UNK_UNK I've had it at the first one, but it says you may need my thickness to change
UNK_UNK Yeah one sec
UNK_UNK i have the crankshaft bearing offset and diameter
UNK_UNK we need to decrease it a bit
UNK_UNK cool we are good
UNK_UNK Hi
UNK_UNK What just changed?
UNK_UNK looks like I picked a whole bouquet of oopsy daisies
UNK_UNK Oh wait we hit excellent
UNK_UNK c=60, dc=15
UNK_UNK Our FOS went up
UNK_UNK my lowest FOS is over 4000, crankshaft is the only person I would have to talk to\
UNK_UNK what happended to our FOS?
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK our overall numbers keep fluctuating like mad
UNK_UNK i wouldnt up your weight
UNK_UNK my individual FOS is in the range of 2000. not sure how to compare that to 2FOS on a system wide level
UNK_UNK So my factor of safety is too high so I should focus on the mass
UNK_UNK im at 2.72kg and 2.28 fos
UNK_UNK did you make a change?
UNK_UNK I think we are done
UNK_UNK doth D and thickness increase the factor of safety and mass
UNK_UNK Thanks! good job!
UNK_UNK what, the crankshaft bearing offset?
UNK_UNK what are your current thickness and diameter?
UNK_UNK probably
UNK_UNK FOS is 2.85
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK I'll try it
UNK_UNK hiyo
UNK_UNK probably
UNK_UNK great job
UNK_UNK *?
UNK_UNK yes. I can get up to a FOS of 3 at 45 but only 1.23 at 47.5
UNK_UNK ok we're close
UNK_UNK any way i can help in reducing hat weight
UNK_UNK Agreed
UNK_UNK Ok we're good I think
UNK_UNK For D = 75 my minimum FOS is 2.85
UNK_UNK I think I have the easiest part lol.  No one's asking my parameters so I guess no one depends on them
UNK_UNK I think someone's trying to get excellent
UNK_UNK lowering ds helps with mass
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK we are pretty close
UNK_UNK I think the 82.5 is the best. let me know when you are okay for me to change it back.
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK whats your name fam?
UNK_UNK yo uright
UNK_UNK Because everyone else is min mass
UNK_UNK My FS went down I think.
UNK_UNK thanks, can you try increasing it to around 97.5 or something, Im trying to see how it effects my numbers
UNK_UNK pretty sure its someone else
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Is there a way to see the other values? The main one updates but I can't see others.
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK actually
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK That's odd, I don't have either of those variables
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK but yes, we need to keep track of where we are
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK i believe 90
UNK_UNK yeah the one thing we need to cut is weight
UNK_UNK yea what we have right now is perfect
UNK_UNK bc thats the lowest and system level fos
UNK_UNK Cause the FOS only goes up by like .5
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find a happy medium to help maximize the fos while minimizing its mass
UNK_UNK Gott an idea for the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK 82.5, that is the second lowest for me
UNK_UNK mine is still at excellent so I don't know
UNK_UNK group- does anyone depend on tf, ds
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK increases it
UNK_UNK idk whos changing stuff
UNK_UNK Group- only piston engineer edits
UNK_UNK I think a lower D is better. something like a 75 was giving us a good weight
UNK_UNK mine has stayed the same and so has crankshaft
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK Currently is 21.49 for me, FoS is 1.74
UNK_UNK get*
UNK_UNK have you heard anything from flywheel or crankshaft?
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK so really not much
UNK_UNK _|_|_
UNK_UNK It does not affect my simulation.
UNK_UNK I don't actually
UNK_UNK Lowering the diameter increases my FoS by about 4 and increases mass by about 1kg
UNK_UNK Yeah, my fos is minimized as well
UNK_UNK I decreases mass bu 0.04 and decreased FOS by 2 due to piston changes
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK What weight are you at?
UNK_UNK i was at t=10 and d=15 or 20
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK i agree haha
UNK_UNK Smaller is good, I like 45 
UNK_UNK most of the mass is in the crank. I think you and the crank have some dependency on one another
UNK_UNK generally our FOS is fine, we need to decrease mass
UNK_UNK Ok, someone changed something and made it much worse
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK Don't change anything!
UNK_UNK I used 70mm. Try to update yours
UNK_UNK I set t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4, and the quality turns out to be excellent
UNK_UNK the flywheel thickness and shaft diameter
UNK_UNK Okay we are at
UNK_UNK Okay I have piston piston diameter (D) and and piston pin length (l1) and inner and outer piston pin diameters (di, do)
UNK_UNK I assume the 30 was for the thickness right?
UNK_UNK I adjusted my numbers, mass is now 0.16 fos is 4.66
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos?
UNK_UNK Makes sense, the connecting rod probably has more impact on FOS than mass
UNK_UNK Don't forget to broadcast your most promising results
UNK_UNK Sure
UNK_UNK wanna shoot for excellent? :P
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK changing piston currently has 0 effect on fos whatsoever
UNK_UNK seems to be maximized at 2.62 ill keep trying other values
UNK_UNK is there any way you can make our fos increase
UNK_UNK make sure you update the broadcast as often as you can
UNK_UNK just to see is it the one with the lowest ms and highest fos in the far right column?
UNK_UNK What are your values
UNK_UNK XI_IO
UNK_UNK 0.13
UNK_UNK wow that is large
UNK_UNK At 75 diameter for me, the best I have is 2.85FOS and 6.26mass
UNK_UNK I don't think that's right
UNK_UNK Looks like the crankshaft is very heavy. Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
UNK_UNK hey, im seeing the Crankshaft bearing support offset to be 60.0mm, is this what you got 
UNK_UNK (Copy/pasting to everyone): We could try having everyone put their system to maximum FOS, and then slowly decreasing factors to recuce mass
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK Hey, what are the updates you would have on the piston bore diameter if any
UNK_UNK who went down in weight?
UNK_UNK ive got you at 75
UNK_UNK no it is not
UNK_UNK I can increase my mass toi 0.75 and my Fos to 24.38
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK new phone who dis?
UNK_UNK someone just broadcasted somethhing different and raised our mass to 3.25
UNK_UNK Anything changing when you change your numbers now?
UNK_UNK we should always report current fos
UNK_UNK i shit you not lol.
UNK_UNK same here
UNK_UNK or does it at all
UNK_UNK *ok if I put a * in front of a message it has gone to everyone
UNK_UNK It only matters about our lowest one I believe
UNK_UNK c=150
UNK_UNK okay so the piston and I also have that variable and we have it at 47.5 currently
UNK_UNK man what happened
UNK_UNK I'll prioritize on increasing FS
UNK_UNK so yes smaller piston diameter improves my fos
UNK_UNK *conrod
UNK_UNK It just updated to 3.2, but yea. Is there any parameter you need from me?
UNK_UNK yeah thats weird
UNK_UNK where they maximum minimum of both variables?
UNK_UNK That's where it was when we got the result as good
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK It was up and then it went down for some reason
UNK_UNK Do you need either of those?
UNK_UNK What are you choosing for your initial piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK yeah I saw that, I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK Are these affecting your results?
UNK_UNK So I think for 40 mm is good for now
UNK_UNK If you can lower FOS to closer to 2 we might be in business, I think we need to get below the mass limit
UNK_UNK we got it!
UNK_UNK can you please share your design variables so that we know what each needs
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK It was good for a second, what happened
UNK_UNK mainly because mass
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK Yeah, what's your system mass atm?
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK Since the lowest of my designs is like 140, I'm going to prioritize mass reduction
UNK_UNK ith piston d = 75, bearing 187.5, flywheel 12 and shaft 40, we have a FS below 2, but our mass is good. we were fair
UNK_UNK sorry I was distracted by other teammates\
UNK_UNK does anyone have a variable that could decrease the mass further while still holding a high FOS
UNK_UNK I still see that our system's fos is .68? odd
UNK_UNK What is your current FOS?
UNK_UNK Currently the Piston Bore Diameter is 40
UNK_UNK piston-pin has the lowest I believe, 1.67
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK It looks a little better now
UNK_UNK D = 90
UNK_UNK is your FOS 1.79?
UNK_UNK if we could take off 2 kgs wed be golden
UNK_UNK flywheel FOS are all very high
UNK_UNK go back to 88mm diameter i want to see what happens
UNK_UNK So try decimals, maintain FOS>2 and minimize mass.
UNK_UNK Can we lower that? It might drop mass.
UNK_UNK What's the mass that you are using?
UNK_UNK are you still using D = 40?
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
UNK_UNK let me know if you do
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK FS is good just decrease mass
UNK_UNK what are your design variables and the other variable that is important to you?
UNK_UNK i need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK okay, so let's try to get a high FS, as flywheel has huge masses, and they well work on mass reduction
UNK_UNK I see
UNK_UNK try to increase your FS
UNK_UNK Okay, how about you try to increase your FS, prioritize that
UNK_UNK that's what the piston guy is saying
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Lets not change it
UNK_UNK omggg
UNK_UNK our FOS is so low
UNK_UNK okay sweet
UNK_UNK what's your fos?
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK 27.44
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK like our robot is handicapped
UNK_UNK Do you need dc?
UNK_UNK are the other people responding
UNK_UNK is 150.0 the best value?
UNK_UNK stop changing
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK What variables/equations do you deal with?
UNK_UNK go with 90 for now
UNK_UNK What's is the factor of safety for the piston-pin?
UNK_UNK at 62.5 the mass goes up from 1.89 to 2.94
UNK_UNK ya the fos is so bad
UNK_UNK i'm determining dc and c
UNK_UNK the new one is 45 as of now
UNK_UNK so let's lower our weight first
UNK_UNK Yeah thats what I got
UNK_UNK Sorry I just mine back to 25
UNK_UNK Same haha
UNK_UNK should i switch back then?
UNK_UNK should we end?
UNK_UNK ya, and im at poor quality, are you as well?
UNK_UNK am ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK The crank-pin diameter and bearing support offset are my variables
UNK_UNK Diameter is 40 mm
UNK_UNK anyone know why it went back to poor?
UNK_UNK we should try and edit our options to optimize theirs then
UNK_UNK truuu
UNK_UNK Im going to reduce piston D to 75to see what happens
UNK_UNK Lost a great deal on FOS.
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK anything above a diamter of 47 gives me very low FOS
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting your latest values? and your FOS is above 2 right?
UNK_UNK Did you change something?
UNK_UNK 2.5
UNK_UNK our global FS just the lowest part FS you think
UNK_UNK D =75
UNK_UNK fos went from 3.18 to 2.95 and mass from 0.13 to 0.11
UNK_UNK nice fair!
UNK_UNK doing that now
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK at the top it says round 2
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK I have set my dimensions to get the lowest possible mass and a FOS of 2.01. Do let me know if you need anything from me
UNK_UNK decrease mass
UNK_UNK whats your current fos
UNK_UNK what are your ranges?
UNK_UNK I did not
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK 8.67
UNK_UNK now its 1.67
UNK_UNK that's cool
UNK_UNK our mass just went up 20kg...
UNK_UNK but we need to increase factor of saftey
UNK_UNK 12 for tf and 60 for ds
UNK_UNK *he or she
UNK_UNK whats your mass at?
UNK_UNK only .7 away now
UNK_UNK I say we stop changing
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
UNK_UNK Can we try something as a group- look at the projected outputs column, not the variables you control. Can everyone try to select the inputs that get the LOWEST mass output?
UNK_UNK global is at 2.47, individual is 15886.04
UNK_UNK Mass yes
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK ds and tf yes
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK i dont know the piston diameter
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK i have diameter at 47.5with m = 0.07 and fos = 1.23
UNK_UNK we just need to lower our mass
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK Actually its better now
UNK_UNK what is your mass and fos when you maximize both your design variables
UNK_UNK i think i will reach my  ideal values in a second
UNK_UNK D is critical to increase the weight for my simulation
UNK_UNK ok conrod's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK cats game
UNK_UNK Our FOS dipped again
UNK_UNK awesome
UNK_UNK and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK I can minimize my diameter
UNK_UNK gotta be inclusive gosh
UNK_UNK Hello, what is the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK right now i have a thickness of 12 and diameter of 60
UNK_UNK Yeah same here
UNK_UNK did you change?
UNK_UNK our FOS still needs to go up
UNK_UNK So I'm trying to pick values of D and tH that will minimize m and maximize FOS, but I know D also interacts with Force
UNK_UNK Time is up i believe
UNK_UNK now it dropped
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK our mass seems to be going up, are you using the original values?
UNK_UNK i am using 60 rn
UNK_UNK minimum is 15 and i am at 20
UNK_UNK I will update you soon
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS > 2?
UNK_UNK ya go ahead and change it back, can you lower D any more?
UNK_UNK min with highest fos
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK what value did you decide on? nothing updated on my screen
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK Don't change anything
UNK_UNK What is your FOS and mass at currently?
UNK_UNK he won't respond to me
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK crankshaft a lil suspicious too
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK ok if its the same as what we had at excellent then it should be fine but it isnt
UNK_UNK can you try 80?
UNK_UNK just remember what you have now
UNK_UNK oh nice
UNK_UNK maximize FOS
UNK_UNK I chose a t_f = 12.0 and d_s = 60.0
UNK_UNK is a larger or smaller bore diameter good for you?
UNK_UNK cause i havent been changing my stuff and its fluctuating
UNK_UNK with the different simulation numbers
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK A higher diameter increases the Fos but also increases the mass. with D=40 im at a mass of 0.1 and fos 2.77
UNK_UNK Yeah. Im on the second lightest option
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK The flywheel shaft diameter was just changed to 17.5
UNK_UNK yeah try that
UNK_UNK hey
UNK_UNK what happened to our FOS oh geez
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK that's the highest
UNK_UNK ive got a FOS of 3.91, lets see if we can get it further above 2
UNK_UNK and go max
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK do you have the 1.65 fos?
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK Do you know whats up
UNK_UNK no I got my best value
UNK_UNK 51 and 1.1 my values keep getting messed up
UNK_UNK can you get it to 60?
UNK_UNK Let me know if you change the bearing offset
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK Yup..
UNK_UNK how much does the connecting rod currently weigh?
UNK_UNK 4.55
UNK_UNK Did you broadcast anything recently?
UNK_UNK (To all): "Very Good" is fine with me
UNK_UNK I'm looking for the lowest mass with highest fos right now
UNK_UNK Do you want a lagre mass?
UNK_UNK does your design depend on the flywheel at all?
UNK_UNK yes pistonpin said same thing
UNK_UNK meant decrease thickness and lower the weight
UNK_UNK Is the mass significantly increased?
UNK_UNK ok decrease mass as much as possible, I cant decrease much more
UNK_UNK sadly no i am at the lowest limit for the piston diamter, connecting rod thickness, and connecting rod length ratio
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my value
UNK_UNK 12 and 60
UNK_UNK We are compromising mass
UNK_UNK no I just asked piston pin guy
UNK_UNK 3286 right now
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK 70
UNK_UNK can you share your equations?
UNK_UNK Mine is at 2.05
UNK_UNK i do not
UNK_UNK Yeah that's what I've found too
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK 75: 5.45, 85: 6.72, 95: 8.08, 105: 9.56. These are the masses for a FOS of 2 for different diameters
UNK_UNK I just saved mass changing tf to 30
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK tell him to sneeze
UNK_UNK are we all selected?
UNK_UNK my design is basically fixed, i found a good design that have decent fos but not too heavy
UNK_UNK Try and decrease C so that we increase the factor of safety
UNK_UNK What are your design variables currently?
UNK_UNK cool. not touching anything
UNK_UNK alriight
UNK_UNK can you try using 50 mm? and try to maximize the fos?
UNK_UNK what about you?
UNK_UNK ok so do you know why our mass is so high
UNK_UNK piston pin is having troublemaxing ofs
UNK_UNK let me know what you think crank bearing offset (c) will be
UNK_UNK FOS?
UNK_UNK and ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter
UNK_UNK It showed very good and I haven't changed anything since then.
UNK_UNK I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK I know its weird
UNK_UNK dec mass
UNK_UNK hows it going?
UNK_UNK it's at very good for me
UNK_UNK What are your design variables?
UNK_UNK For lower mass I could make it 40, it sounds like my part is the heaviest and doesn't affect FOS as much
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK did any mass values change?
UNK_UNK okay, the bearing support offset should be minimized for my part and an increasing crank pin diameter increases my FOS
UNK_UNK the minimum mass I have while the FOS is above 2 is 5.45. I have made 14 simulations to justify the result.
UNK_UNK what's your mass and fos when diameter of 70mm is used?
UNK_UNK idk what im doing at the moment
UNK_UNK Do you need info from me
UNK_UNK got it
UNK_UNK and*
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK Do u depend on the bore diameter?
UNK_UNK large D helps me,my mass is at .05, and my fos_s is 2.03, not sure i can get much better
UNK_UNK there ya go
UNK_UNK what is your mass/fos
UNK_UNK if one of the other values changes, does it give you more options? Like if D increased or decreased?
UNK_UNK mass is 1.18 and thats with both as low as they can get
UNK_UNK We need to increase FOS somehow
UNK_UNK I'm not sure any of your variables affect the piston pin?
UNK_UNK since we have five members, and the excellent mass is 2, then let's first pick a mass value around 0.4 together
UNK_UNK Just changed some things so we are going in the right direction!
UNK_UNK what is your mass currently?
UNK_UNK mine depends on crankshaft
UNK_UNK But I have the minimum fos so I'll fail first so shouldnt that be the most important
UNK_UNK i think he does the bore design
UNK_UNK minimized
UNK_UNK Bore diameter increased
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK also decreases my fos
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK 6.61
UNK_UNK The global variables are giving our current FOS is 0.57 so I think we need to maximize that
UNK_UNK My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
UNK_UNK I haven't heard anything from the crankshaft guy
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK 150 is lowest right?
UNK_UNK I don't know
UNK_UNK what is your fos rn?
UNK_UNK try that
UNK_UNK Crankshaft@1.08 kg
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK Yep
UNK_UNK Anyway you can reduce mass slightly
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK Yea, it's better to minimize c
UNK_UNK Higher offset lowers my fos a lot just fyi
UNK_UNK my configuration has one of the lowest masses available atm
UNK_UNK were at very good rn
UNK_UNK Does it kill the FOS if you decrease the offset below 150?
UNK_UNK Flywheel prob
UNK_UNK okay sounds good
UNK_UNK q4: did we talk about it in our classes this semester?
UNK_UNK ok make sure your fos is never below 2
UNK_UNK Done
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK With t 10 d 25 and c=70 the output is ms=0.55 and fos=4821.91
UNK_UNK Good working with you too!
UNK_UNK Its excellent rn so dont change it without writing down what you have now
UNK_UNK Are you still running with diameter of 40
UNK_UNK f_os = 9193.31
UNK_UNK yeah, leave yours in a safe config
UNK_UNK we're good now
UNK_UNK Oh ok. Because we went back to poor
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK my personal FOS is 4.55 and my personal parameter selection minimizes mass
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK damn
UNK_UNK Keep 70 mm I'm trying to get out of the poor region
UNK_UNK hows it going
UNK_UNK No, I do not need anything
UNK_UNK 7.02
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK All I need is the diameter
UNK_UNK what value are you using because my design is dependant on that value
UNK_UNK our weight is too high
UNK_UNK adjust which part?
UNK_UNK let's not change it
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK Hows it looking now
UNK_UNK the one we currently have is the default
UNK_UNK can you try the one thats closes to 2?
UNK_UNK My current Settings are: m=0.01 and FOS=0.14
UNK_UNK I didn't, and neither did crankshaft. I think flywheel did
UNK_UNK great fos right now
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK Ok I think you are solid then
UNK_UNK enough money for me
UNK_UNK FS like .5 to 4
UNK_UNK sweet we just need to get mass down
UNK_UNK sorry i wrote backwards, increasing piston bore diameter increases my mass and factor of safety is something i dont control
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK The best thing we can do right now is decrease the mass but if I try to do that on my end i only end up reducing it by 0.03
UNK_UNK our mass seems to be going up, are you using the original values?
UNK_UNK With 0.12 mass.
UNK_UNK group-save current values as backup 12
UNK_UNK Keep it steady we got excellent
UNK_UNK No
UNK_UNK crankshaft offset
UNK_UNK What is the relationship between those two and FOS? For D, increasing it increases area and therefore the max gas force, but also will increase mass
UNK_UNK best I get
UNK_UNK Not for a little bit. did something change for you?
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight redutions
UNK_UNK It wasn't me or the piston. Ive recorded my values in case something happens
UNK_UNK nevermind, back at excellent now.
UNK_UNK ok so your mass should be fine. not a big contributing factor
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK I just updated my broadcast. I found good values that work, but I can iterate mine if need be. Just let me know.
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK 40-70
UNK_UNK I think it should be up
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK could you lower the mass by 2 kg without skrewing the fos
UNK_UNK PIck the lowest mass over an FS of 2
UNK_UNK 40 mm works fine for me. Fs of 4.71 and mass of 0.76. I will continue to iterate.
UNK_UNK Hi, what is the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK or like a mix since both my variable are pretty influential
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK just got an FOS of 2.03 and mass of 1.01
UNK_UNK is that a typo?
UNK_UNK Our mass is too high, can we try and select variables to reduce the overall mass and broadcast those? (sending this to the others as well)
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK m = 0.07 and fos = 1.23
UNK_UNK no problem
UNK_UNK larger has a better FOS but the currently I used 45 and it's just high enough
UNK_UNK what is the piston bore
UNK_UNK why isnt this excellent?
UNK_UNK Lets improve lowest FOS now. What is yours?
UNK_UNK ...
UNK_UNK ah, change it back to 80 then?
UNK_UNK whats your FOS if you drop mass by 3kg
UNK_UNK gotta love it
UNK_UNK group: ok remember the current values you have as back up
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK neato
UNK_UNK Yeah for a bit.
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK We just hit very good
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK yeah check again. thats me. funny relations with crankshaft
UNK_UNK Definitely!
UNK_UNK i even reclicked the one ive been using to make sure it didnt change somehow
UNK_UNK Yeah I put my thickness and diameter to make ms=0.52
UNK_UNK hmm okay
UNK_UNK I am designing the piston. i control the piston diameter and head thickness.
UNK_UNK i have a really small mass, so im going to experiment with slightly higher masses and see if any of you get better simulation options
UNK_UNK i gotchu
UNK_UNK I have not touched mine
UNK_UNK we got excellent
UNK_UNK Let me know if you need me to decrease mass, I can decrease by 0.5 but my FOS goes down by 2
UNK_UNK 2.11. I can't really descrease is. my dimensions are at their max/min
UNK_UNK left side when walking in
UNK_UNK flywheel thickness and flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK m = 0.16, fos = 4.66
UNK_UNK increasing D increases my fos
UNK_UNK and ya no its not which is nice
UNK_UNK yep just did
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK I want to minimize my thickness and maximize my diameter to get the best mass and fos
UNK_UNK i havent changed anything
UNK_UNK I don't know how that affects me, but my simulation shows excellent.  I think someone isn't broadcasting the right values
UNK_UNK and your mass?
UNK_UNK What are your settings now?
UNK_UNK Is 75 still the number youre going with
UNK_UNK definitely
UNK_UNK those values give the best FOS value ans 2nd lowest mass
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK wow ok
UNK_UNK Let me know if changing my D value could help improve the FOS or mass
UNK_UNK Currently I have the lowest piston diameter selected, but in general yes lower diameter means lower mass and FOS
UNK_UNK Got and idea for the flywheel thickness?
UNK_UNK alright after talking with the others, the goal seems to be minimize mass while keeping FOS at just above 2
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK aight aight haha
UNK_UNK sure
UNK_UNK Looks like they're working with 75 right now, but just forgot to broadcast.
UNK_UNK Whats your current diameter?
UNK_UNK okay im at max fos
UNK_UNK Hi Kamran
UNK_UNK Cool, and that brings the piston-pin FOS to just under 2
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK nothing much i could change at 45
UNK_UNK Right now FOS = 2.01
UNK_UNK Its now at 82.5
UNK_UNK I had r2=.75, and r3=.68 and that gave an okay FOS, but I just lowered it to r2=.7 and r3=.55 which lowered the FOS too much
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK Yeah, what parameters are you designing for?
UNK_UNK What is your range for D?
UNK_UNK bore diameter is 40mm
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK ds tf and D
UNK_UNK no i dont have control of it
UNK_UNK What is your current bearing offset?
UNK_UNK no i do not
UNK_UNK Tell me the tradeoffs
UNK_UNK do you control piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK Ok the ideal design for me is D at 40. My mass goes down to 1.28 and FOS at 17.82. Try that
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Hahaha wow
UNK_UNK okay we need this FOS to go up
UNK_UNK What mass are you at?
UNK_UNK But i dont control that
UNK_UNK What's going on, bud?
UNK_UNK I agree
UNK_UNK group - does anyones part depend on the connecting rod? (t1 or r1) (thickness or length)
UNK_UNK it's corrected
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK This is strange
UNK_UNK what's your FOS
UNK_UNK Lets not change it now
UNK_UNK rn my mass is 6.5 and fos is 2.09
UNK_UNK current dims (D=40, t_h=3.25), i think this is the best i can achieve without making the engine massive 
UNK_UNK What's your mass?
UNK_UNK Talking with crankshaft since we need to coordinate on mass
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK let's just determine the weight first
UNK_UNK okay so my FOS is over 2000 for any design parameters and the mass is less than 2 so I can't figure out how my design affects everyone
UNK_UNK I think the chart on the board is correct while the one in the packet is wrong
UNK_UNK are you changing
UNK_UNK what diameter have you chosen?
UNK_UNK X|X|O
UNK_UNK Your old values gave a higher mass with same Fos, but not sure how it affects other stuff
UNK_UNK does yours show exccelent?
UNK_UNK yeah, lowest i've gotten with an FOS>2
UNK_UNK ok what about mass?
UNK_UNK i guess it's the system messing with us lol
UNK_UNK sorry their FOS
UNK_UNK I meant shaft diameter
UNK_UNK we are using 75 mm rn
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK wasnt me
UNK_UNK Hold on maybe I can lower the thickness
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel next, please try to get mass down without going under fos of 2
UNK_UNK Ok
UNK_UNK yeah idk what
UNK_UNK THis is tru. communicate with crankshaft. He's our weakest link FoS wise at the moment
UNK_UNK Whats your mass and Fos?
UNK_UNK yaa i went tuesday simply to get my exam back
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK I think you have the lowest FOS among all of us
UNK_UNK What parameter do you control?
UNK_UNK The one I picked was 0.55 kg, with the lowest at 0.52 kg, but the FS is 5,625
UNK_UNK I don't think it is
UNK_UNK Could you reselect your previous lower mass simulation if you havent already?
UNK_UNK No. You have the lowest FOS at 1.92 currently
UNK_UNK then we will see how the fos changes
UNK_UNK are you still updating mass? we were in excellent
UNK_UNK oh nvm
UNK_UNK from piston pin designer: pistonpinDesign variables: ratio of piston-pin length to piston diameter pistonpinand ratio of piston pin inner diameter to outer diameter pistonpinI need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK I have FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK done
UNK_UNK m 1.14 fos 1.32
UNK_UNK (To all): What ever change was just made, we should put it back
UNK_UNK alright I will try and reduce the mass
UNK_UNK yes, currently it is at 2.27
UNK_UNK we already had it once
UNK_UNK 150 is working pretty well for me right now
UNK_UNK What can I change to help improve your design?
UNK_UNK we've gotta figure out how all the other factors connect
UNK_UNK no mine is 2.0
UNK_UNK 130
UNK_UNK who changed
UNK_UNK They didn't give me that one. I just have crankshaft bearing offset, crankshaft-pin diameter to change
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2
UNK_UNK D=75, m = 1.36, fos = 2.85
UNK_UNK Hey, just want to make sure that the bearing offset is still 70 mm
UNK_UNK what values work best for you
UNK_UNK Ok I think someone is confused
UNK_UNK Ok were good on mass for now.
UNK_UNK hello, what variable do you have control over? and what variable do you need to know that controlled by others?
UNK_UNK and another is Input piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK no one depends on mine either
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK okay you ask piston guy
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK 2.77
UNK_UNK Mine is at 2.36
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK dont change anything hahah nice
UNK_UNK Yeah, that's not on me.
UNK_UNK What's your fos?
UNK_UNK Can you find a way to increase the FOS for your component?
UNK_UNK what does thatdo?
UNK_UNK I think my d_c makes someone elses subsystem a lot heavier
UNK_UNK alright
UNK_UNK we are 1.94 over mass rn
UNK_UNK that is a lot, between you and the piston, you guys have the majority of the weight
UNK_UNK otherwise my FOS is below 1
UNK_UNK m = 0.05 and fos =2.03
UNK_UNK i determine c and dc
UNK_UNK wait your ds is 15 now?
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK are you changing anything ?
UNK_UNK What is your current analysis?
UNK_UNK (to everyone)I increased the mass of piston and the mass went down and fos went up
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK minimum mass and about 2.03 FOS
UNK_UNK lmao both of them?
UNK_UNK so it looks like our mass is killing us now
UNK_UNK what is your fos?
UNK_UNK 15 to 25
UNK_UNK as someone changes their values, all other fvalues are forced to change
UNK_UNK yes!
UNK_UNK I have it set to max currently, so we may need to both be changing that
UNK_UNK I didn't change anything
UNK_UNK ^^^^^
UNK_UNK for my subsystem?
UNK_UNK yeah im trying to keep it on the high end
UNK_UNK Do you depend on any of my variables?
UNK_UNK Yea, but also the weight
UNK_UNK i can increase by 1 pound and fos also goes up by 1 which is a lot, can anyone lose a lot of mass with a small decrease in fos?
UNK_UNK I haven't changed my dimensions for awhile now, hope that helps
UNK_UNK what variables do you depend on?
UNK_UNK we need to decrease the mass
UNK_UNK Same here. Mass has a huge effect, because we need it under 2 kg to get "excellent".
UNK_UNK tbh i think it might be flywheel
UNK_UNK Okay, do you know who is making the FOS so low?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK thanks! :)
UNK_UNK My system FS is 2.05 atm
UNK_UNK can you cut the mass by any chance?
UNK_UNK we had "good" at one point didnt we?
UNK_UNK yeah thats the totla
UNK_UNK We are going back up...
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK sweet thanks - let me know when you do
UNK_UNK lol definitely, i'm keeping my values the same for now and trying to communicate with everyone
UNK_UNK whyd we get bumped down
UNK_UNK by about .7 or 1
UNK_UNK I can decrease my mass by .19kg but that brings my FoS down 1.49
UNK_UNK Group: no more changes!
UNK_UNK piston-pin length to piston diameter ratio and piston-pin inner diameter to pin outer diameter ratio
UNK_UNK lmk when you do
UNK_UNK ok keep those for now
UNK_UNK Group: I will decrease mine now
UNK_UNK Aiming for a FS slightly above 2 will let us minimize mass and have a shot at the "very good" or "excellent" marks, is there anything you need from me?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK I need: piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast variables
UNK_UNK slightly
UNK_UNK Is either tf or ds a variable of other subsystems for you?
UNK_UNK 22.4 and 1.5
UNK_UNK mass = 11.09
UNK_UNK alright awesome
UNK_UNK Make sure to broad cast variables
UNK_UNK what are you FS/Ms at rn?
UNK_UNK Is it safe to say we are only tweaking ds and D at this point? I have partial control over ds. What do you have?
UNK_UNK they don't wanna give us 20 bucks
UNK_UNK i will compile
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK No one change anything
UNK_UNK grp-im done
UNK_UNK im going to try to see what decreasing my mass slighlty does
UNK_UNK indeed
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK Nope
UNK_UNK how much does the fly wheel weigh?
UNK_UNK communication is key my brotha
UNK_UNK can you decrease the thickness and increase diametera?
UNK_UNK okay nice
UNK_UNK I still see the total mass of 2.84
UNK_UNK not much, my Fs will decrease dramatically for a drop in 0.03 mass
UNK_UNK sorry, dc\
UNK_UNK 150 is the lower bound...
UNK_UNK yeah that is what i am thinking as well
UNK_UNK maybe my part doesn't matter
UNK_UNK Will make it larger only if you need
UNK_UNK are the dimensions still the same
UNK_UNK so for you design a lower c is better?  does dc affect yours at all?
UNK_UNK whats the lowest/highest mass and fos for you
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK Alright sounds good. Does the bore diameter effect you at all?
UNK_UNK *what values is everyone in control of
UNK_UNK okay, I will see what i can do with 53
UNK_UNK no just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK wait we're at very good
UNK_UNK we should aim for a smaller total mass, it's a little close to 40
UNK_UNK $$$$$
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK could you make it larger?
UNK_UNK I can, my lowest mass with the 45 bore diameter is 0.11, fos for that is 2.95
UNK_UNK 1.94
UNK_UNK actually sorry i cant go below 150
UNK_UNK that wasnt me
UNK_UNK O|X|X
UNK_UNK i'm trying to minimize weight while keeping fos around 2
UNK_UNK 1.23 is the maximum possible fs for the piston pin at the current piston diameter
UNK_UNK updated mass to .46, fos to 10.7
UNK_UNK mass = 4, FoS = 2.4
UNK_UNK ok just making sure it updates
UNK_UNK I did, earlier
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK AMAZING FOS
UNK_UNK ok same. what is your current diameter size
UNK_UNK My mass is as low as possible. We cant all have the minimum mass
UNK_UNK go back to what we were at
UNK_UNK 150mm
UNK_UNK no way
UNK_UNK Mine still says fair (m=2.96, FOS=1.73).  I can increase mass by 0.28, but increase FOS by 2.63.  Someone would need to decrease the mass by at least .28 tho
UNK_UNK also input piston bore diameter in mm
UNK_UNK ok mine are c and dc will look into those
UNK_UNK My parameters are thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter. If you feel this directly applies to your design let me know!
UNK_UNK What's r? I think they gave us different variable names
UNK_UNK great, thanks!
UNK_UNK use 15 for now as I try to find better values on my end
UNK_UNK c
UNK_UNK and FOS?
UNK_UNK are you working with others? Flywheel only depends on crankshaft and it will only affect crankshaft so Idk what to do with others
UNK_UNK nevermind just updated broadcast
UNK_UNK Ok try for a midpack FOS-mass choice
UNK_UNK why did it go down?
UNK_UNK What's your FoS?
UNK_UNK when D is max
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department. Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK and can it be lowered
UNK_UNK and*
UNK_UNK I have my best values broadcast with .12kg and FOS=3.44
UNK_UNK what ur fos
UNK_UNK these are the same values for the "very good" design
UNK_UNK what is your diameter?
UNK_UNK Since the lowest of my designs is like 140, I'm going to prioritize mass reduction
UNK_UNK What's the FOS of your current selection? I'm trying to figure out what part has the most influnce over FOS
UNK_UNK Okay sounds good
UNK_UNK global is at 2.3 right now
UNK_UNK total
UNK_UNK Yeah that's what im trying to find out
UNK_UNK we arent at excellent we would have to drop the weight around 2kg
UNK_UNK 80
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK Flywheel mass: from 0.52 to 1.0, FOS from 701 to 5625. 
UNK_UNK I'm on the lightest option, but if I go up at all we'll go over 3
UNK_UNK both, becaus FOS is pretty low too
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK is your fos 0.09 now?
UNK_UNK m and fos for you?
UNK_UNK Flywheel shaft diameter
UNK_UNK Im currently broadcasting c 60 dc 10 which is m .99 and fos .67
UNK_UNK some one got good quality what where your variables in that
UNK_UNK Crankshaft bearing offset? I don't control that variable!
UNK_UNK I think you're right
UNK_UNK the weight increased for some reason
UNK_UNK Around 2 would be ideal
UNK_UNK we are at very good again as of 12;53
UNK_UNK do your projected outputs change when an update happens?
UNK_UNK Keep me updated on your piston bore diameter. It's something I'll need in my simulations
UNK_UNK have you lowered mass as much as you can?
UNK_UNK yes, we need to system wide reduce weight
UNK_UNK I think hes at fos 1.64 and mass of 2,26 but that was a while ago
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK flywheel, are you good?
UNK_UNK What did u choose for D?
UNK_UNK any way to make your part smaller? i think your part weighs the most.
UNK_UNK are we content with very good?
UNK_UNK based on the handout we should be at "excellent" idk why it doesn't say that
UNK_UNK how? are you broadcasting it?
UNK_UNK yeah that sounds like a good plan
UNK_UNK Lets decrease mass
UNK_UNK at 47.5 or 55?
UNK_UNK don't change for sometine
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK I control bearing support offset (c) and crank-pin diameter (d_c))
UNK_UNK I think that is an average of each designer's parts which is why I think someone's dimensions aren
UNK_UNK DONT TOUCH ANYTHING NOW
UNK_UNK Lets not change anything and get that $20
UNK_UNK crankshaft's variables also depends on piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK was that you?
UNK_UNK Do you have any that depend on the piston pin?
UNK_UNK is there any way you can change your numbers to increase fos while keeping mass similar
UNK_UNK What other parameters do you have? Other than C
UNK_UNK Also lol looking back at my simulations, minimizing D actually increases my mass
UNK_UNK Only way to get higher fos at 1.32 is to raise weight to 1.14
UNK_UNK so are we just done then? lol
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK i changed the mass from 50 to 30
UNK_UNK Yeah I'm talking to the crankshaft
UNK_UNK thats good
UNK_UNK You have bore diameter too?
UNK_UNK I have lowest mass output selected currently
UNK_UNK It's the smae tradeoff for everyone
UNK_UNK just saw that
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK 150
UNK_UNK was given wrong packet to start
UNK_UNK Can you change ds to 55 and braodcast
UNK_UNK As long as your fos is above 2, try to find the lowest possible mass
UNK_UNK just did
UNK_UNK and our average is really low
UNK_UNK c is bearing support offset
UNK_UNK Okay, thank you
UNK_UNK Im going to try upping my mass slighly with a better FOS
UNK_UNK Im working on the connecting rod. Honestly just trying to figure out how to start
UNK_UNK i think you can see it in II) right?
UNK_UNK whats your fos at
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK 50mm*
UNK_UNK 1.26 but before it was 2.09
UNK_UNK c and dc
UNK_UNK Those do not effect me. I may have a slight say in crank length.
UNK_UNK do ti
UNK_UNK yes i changed my numbers
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK FOS no
UNK_UNK does increasing D give you better or worse weight
UNK_UNK dont do that
UNK_UNK not my D the piston's D
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK based on the current values, it should say excellent
UNK_UNK it's poor again lol
UNK_UNK i'm focusing on minimizing thickness primarily
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK or avg
UNK_UNK 75 mm
UNK_UNK It still says .51 and he said that was for the team and that I couldn't see my own. I don't know if that makes sense though??
UNK_UNK do you by any chance know if it was because of your parameters?
UNK_UNK c = 85 and dc = 15
UNK_UNK 1.27
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK it is the smallest it can be
UNK_UNK yes I am
UNK_UNK are you changing your numbers a lot?
UNK_UNK we are looking at the values in pink on the upper right side. We want a FOS just above 2 and weight below 35
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK Oh yeah
UNK_UNK tell him to reply or ur changing ur value
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK If the piston diameter is 75, I can get a good mix of mass and fs
UNK_UNK thanks
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK yeah drop that to like 1.5 if you can
UNK_UNK Do you have an option of an FOS of at least 1?
UNK_UNK ok for me larger piston bore increases m and fos too
UNK_UNK go back to what you had bc we were at good
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK has anyone gotten a simulation besides poor as the results?
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK Yeah, FOS hasn't been an issue for me, it's just mass is way too high
UNK_UNK back to poor
UNK_UNK can you try decreasing your mass?
UNK_UNK dont change!
UNK_UNK We have 0.15 mass to play with. What options do you have for that which could increase FOS?
UNK_UNK we're at good lets leave it
UNK_UNK how are your masses and FS looking?
UNK_UNK actually keep 45 for crankshaft
UNK_UNK i saw a very good for a second but its gone now
UNK_UNK Make sure your part's FOS isnt the same as the sub system's. If it is, increase it slightly
UNK_UNK i updated my design
UNK_UNK and then I depend on ds, t_f, and D
UNK_UNK it was excelent, someone messed it up
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK I have two I can jump behind but it depends on what everyone else can get m and fos to
UNK_UNK lower bore diameter? on it. I'll go down to 55 and see what we can get
UNK_UNK also piston guy is using D=40
UNK_UNK hmmm im not sure
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK ok i got fos 2.02 and mass of 5.82
UNK_UNK down ok with it but if you want to try some more then I will hang around
UNK_UNK My sim shows m=29.24, f=2.83
UNK_UNK I know.
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK its conrod
UNK_UNK Who's in control of bore diameter?
UNK_UNK also, can you give me tf (flywheel thickness)?
UNK_UNK Not moving even a bit :')
UNK_UNK good?
UNK_UNK just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK GROUP: flywheel done for now, please Connecting Rod next with same goal of lower mass w/o fos under 2
UNK_UNK don't know if we can stop or if we have to go the full 45 minutes
UNK_UNK Who is the .96 fos?
UNK_UNK everything is good now but why is it still fair
UNK_UNK what is your FOS now?
UNK_UNK Am broadcasting 150 and 50
UNK_UNK XIXIO
UNK_UNK wait
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK I haven't changed the broadcast for awhile, it must be someone else
UNK_UNK so if you got room for that I can decrease mine abit
UNK_UNK try getting to to increase to a point where piston pin fos remains above 2
UNK_UNK Are you in charge of the variable C? Is it more beneficial to maximize or minimize it?
UNK_UNK Let me know what piston bore diameters are working for you. I will need to update my dimensions.
UNK_UNK 9193
UNK_UNK What is your primary goal in this simulation?
UNK_UNK okay I don't need either of those in my analysis
UNK_UNK It might be a good idea to send the message to all members at once to emulate a group chat.I have communicated the same with the others.
UNK_UNK yeah don't do that lol
UNK_UNK See if you can lower your mass just a little bit
UNK_UNK D = 85, M = 6.72
UNK_UNK (To all): ok with results
UNK_UNK Oh wait nevermind. I don't think we have a piston pin engineer though.
UNK_UNK I'm at Mass 0.69 and FOS 3.84. We need to find some more weight to up your FOS
UNK_UNK Sure.
UNK_UNK Yeah I think that's the best we can get
UNK_UNK whats yours
UNK_UNK My FOS is currently maxed out at 1.23 but I'm trying to raise it more since my mass is so small
UNK_UNK any suggestions?
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK For the flywheel shaft diameter i have 10
UNK_UNK just did!
UNK_UNK now its 1.18
UNK_UNK yes, the minimum is 700 haha
UNK_UNK Are you able to increase our factor of safety at all? I can cut a bit of weight but would have to sacrifce FOS
UNK_UNK so i dont want to change
UNK_UNK 0.87
UNK_UNK Ima try a FS of 3.14 with a mass of 7.71
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK okay so everyone did that, but we are still not doing too well
UNK_UNK same
UNK_UNK 25 mm
UNK_UNK Did
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK Got it thanks
UNK_UNK good stick with that
UNK_UNK what's your fos right now with 70mm diameter?
UNK_UNK I think i have my ideal broadcast
UNK_UNK Because they asked me for that
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK Ok, so bearing offset 150?
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel shaft diameter "ds" affect any variables in your control?
UNK_UNK Mine's 2.03. Don't think I can get that lower
UNK_UNK I think flywheel has the lowest fos
UNK_UNK 40 mm
UNK_UNK Sounds good.  I'll try to decrease shaft mass
UNK_UNK only one i use is c
UNK_UNK 80 as the current design
UNK_UNK GOOD
UNK_UNK It's getting better, keep it up
UNK_UNK just above 2
UNK_UNK Im sitting at m = 0.18 and fos = 3.41. Not trying to change my values
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK my weight is minimized completely fos = 1212
UNK_UNK should i ask their names
UNK_UNK will do
UNK_UNK Oh wait we just need to minimize the mass
UNK_UNK i got it from crankshaft
UNK_UNK but imma find em
UNK_UNK i did
UNK_UNK I dunno
UNK_UNK mass 1.24
UNK_UNK dc is the weight variable for me
UNK_UNK the crankshafts mass is really high
UNK_UNK Fos decrease like 2-3
UNK_UNK Was 12 and 40 still your used numbers?
UNK_UNK I haven't changed in 5 mins
UNK_UNK my time is up
UNK_UNK yea we're at excellent
UNK_UNK whats your FS
UNK_UNK I think we should be good, just don't change anything too much because we are heading in the wrong direction
UNK_UNK group: how much does your part currently weigh
UNK_UNK I have not changed mine
UNK_UNK I think it could be a little lower since a factor of safety above 2 is considered excellent
UNK_UNK Ive changed it and I can sway the overall by roughly 0.1 by adding 0.03 mass
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Waiting on connecting rod to change values now, no one else is at the moment
UNK_UNK same here
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK same 60 is the lowest for the support offset and flywheel guy also agrees so I guess thats good for now
UNK_UNK for my component
UNK_UNK 75 is the lowest diameter I could do and it has alot of impact on the weight so i kept that at minimum and increased thickness to meet safety requirement
UNK_UNK ok im gonna try to get us to exellent dont change
UNK_UNK Try for a FOS of 2 with minimum mass
UNK_UNK No i think its fine i was just curious
UNK_UNK my fos is still 700 so we can trim something on my end
UNK_UNK I am not sure, haven't heard from fly wheel or crankshaft
UNK_UNK Are you in charge of choosing the piston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK _|_|O
UNK_UNK whut is your name
UNK_UNK I have FOS of 4.12 and mass of 1.44
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK Need anything from me?
UNK_UNK well the grade scale shows that a total mass below 2 should be possible
UNK_UNK Quality very good Nice!
UNK_UNK X X O ; _ O _ ; X O _
UNK_UNK alright thanks!
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK just did it
UNK_UNK I am in charge of diameter and piston head thickness. Increasing diameter will increase the area, so more force, but also increase mass. Increasing head thickness will increase mass but also FOS
UNK_UNK woof woof
UNK_UNK check for broadcast?
UNK_UNK mass went up quite a bit on my end
UNK_UNK Flywheel shaft diameter and thickness, piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK since if I lower my part's weight the fos will decrease largely
UNK_UNK D = 75
UNK_UNK who are you working with?
UNK_UNK ok i am not gonna change without letting yopu know
UNK_UNK Yes please!
UNK_UNK I control the thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of its length to crankshaft length. All I know is that increasing either of those increases both the mass and factor of safety
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK We're done
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK okay, I'm going to try and change c
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK I think the flywheel keeps changing values. I cant get a response tho
UNK_UNK We meet the FS requirement, but we lack in the mass department.  Let's reduce mass.
UNK_UNK I need to find two fitting ratios, r2 and r3. As these are increased, the both the mass and FOS decrease
UNK_UNK Yes, that's the goal
UNK_UNK What is the lower range of your weight range
UNK_UNK Okay, I'll play around with it
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting
UNK_UNK I tried decreasing my mass
UNK_UNK now we are at very good
UNK_UNK Great Work
UNK_UNK Yeah looking better
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK my ms is 1.0
UNK_UNK Definitely keep it smaller rather than larger
UNK_UNK could we go with D=40
UNK_UNK same i have a minimized mass currently and stall a 3 fos
UNK_UNK make sure to broadcast
UNK_UNK oh alright
UNK_UNK No, it should still be at 40mm
UNK_UNK Alrighty - how are your mass and FOS numbers looking
UNK_UNK Change it back to 105 because the mass will decrease
UNK_UNK right
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK I'd like to keep it at 47 since that help connecting rod
UNK_UNK oh and the ratio of conrod length to crank length increased by 0.25
UNK_UNK I control Flywheel thickness and Flywheel shaft diameter. I need Crankshaft Bearing Offset
UNK_UNK oh shoot didnt realize when u hit check for broadcast it updates
UNK_UNK rad
UNK_UNK I'm at 2.77
UNK_UNK group-flywheel now
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK I'm starting with 40
UNK_UNK Right now we need to reduce mass and keep FOS. do u want to also see if anyone can do that so its not a free for all
UNK_UNK nor crankshaft
UNK_UNK 10 bucks aint bad
UNK_UNK Hi what is the mass that you are currently using?
UNK_UNK tractor king
UNK_UNK I control thickness of the connecting rod and ratio of connection rod length to crankshaft length
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK yeah ive kinda just given up
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK Could yo uoptimize your fos? I think your weight is mainly negligible
UNK_UNK what ranges of mass do you have for your part?
UNK_UNK exellent dont touch
UNK_UNK 1.92
UNK_UNK Mine is 3.96
UNK_UNK What's your FOS?
UNK_UNK 0.05 kg
UNK_UNK piston mass is currently 0.83
UNK_UNK I let the mknow
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK mass is 1.7 and fos is 3.5
UNK_UNK yea we need to figure out whos value changed
UNK_UNK You?
UNK_UNK 5.82
UNK_UNK Lets try and get back to where Fair was, that seemed like the right track 
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK Not yet
UNK_UNK yeah I haven't changed anything
UNK_UNK your part
UNK_UNK Someone just screwed it up. Now we're in very good
UNK_UNK we are very close to gettin gabove FOS =2 , but see if you have any combinations that have a fos right above 2 but the lowest possibole mass
UNK_UNK So is there any tradeoff at all?
UNK_UNK 3.42
UNK_UNK same here. it would reduce my masses a bit
UNK_UNK Do you know why the mass is so high?
UNK_UNK Piston Diameter = 90, Height = 6.85 >>>> Mass = 7.44, Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK Would the diameter of the piston-pin effect your design at all?
UNK_UNK your part seems pretty light how large can you make the FOS
UNK_UNK and FOS is very low
UNK_UNK using 85 and 15
UNK_UNK maybe everyone fos= 2 is too low...
UNK_UNK and we've reached the global requirements
UNK_UNK I don't think it is an average is it?
UNK_UNK whats your fos
UNK_UNK We were at exceelent and now poor, did you change anything?
UNK_UNK My max is only 0.24 but I can increase it to 0.22 while only adding 0.01 mass
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK rn my mass is 6.5 and fos is 2.09
UNK_UNK woah were at poor now
UNK_UNK im good
UNK_UNK what are the other variables you need?
UNK_UNK ok let me know if you want to change something
UNK_UNK the other values on our team are like between 2.5 and 5000
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK If you can make the bore Diameter 40 then I can get an Fos of 3.44
UNK_UNK 5625
UNK_UNK Bore diameter according to the piston is 40 mm
UNK_UNK I can hold mine above 2 and reduce but me having a high FOS might brign the overall up for not much more mass
UNK_UNK :)
UNK_UNK its up to 1.7 now so getting there
UNK_UNK which I just tried but someone else must have made a change at the same time
UNK_UNK more like first hour
UNK_UNK re using now?
UNK_UNK yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good ?
UNK_UNK we need FOS up a bit more now overall
UNK_UNK oh okay
UNK_UNK tell them that!
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you!
UNK_UNK what's your fos
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK **sidenote: this experiment is probably just recording what we do after we solve the problem
UNK_UNK it says very good
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK I think your dimension has to line up with the flywheel
UNK_UNK ;)
UNK_UNK looks like we're good
UNK_UNK Can you broadcast a design with c as 130?
UNK_UNK that's a requirement
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK wait someone changed something and it went way down
UNK_UNK our weight is the high bit
UNK_UNK ok same
UNK_UNK if you change the diameter to 65
UNK_UNK Actually, that doesn't make any sense, since the minimum value I can put in for the crankshaft bearing offset is 150mm, and your maximum flywheel thickness is 51
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK Does the flywheel thickness or flywheel shaft diameter affect any of your components?
UNK_UNK I did and piston should be low now. rod is only a mass of .14
UNK_UNK did it.  need to drop mass more
UNK_UNK it is yeah
UNK_UNK "Good"
UNK_UNK what is your offset right now
UNK_UNK 44, 1.29
UNK_UNK ok no one anything
UNK_UNK what c value do you currently have?
UNK_UNK I am going to try 160. The larger the offset the larger the mass and smaller fos
UNK_UNK im also at 2 rn
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK the current optimal c and dc i got that yields best results is c = 150 and dc = 50
UNK_UNK What is your max FOS? I think it would be worth it to try and get above 1
UNK_UNK 3.91FOs 5.2m
UNK_UNK still fos of over 1000
UNK_UNK I get better fos but worse mass when i maximize c, so it problably needs to be in the middle
UNK_UNK D = 90 for now
UNK_UNK Oh I've got a different system FOS, mine is about 2
UNK_UNK Broadcast your most up to date values so we know where we're at, if you haven't done so already.
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK okay sounds goof
UNK_UNK yeah im pretty confident mine is not gonna work
UNK_UNK Ive gotten mine to the lowest weight while still having a FS of 2
UNK_UNK I asked but my part is unique when it comes to the fos
UNK_UNK Make sure youre broadcasting the right dimensions. I think someone is not
UNK_UNK oh okok
UNK_UNK 90
UNK_UNK Yeah I won't
UNK_UNK yeah im at what i think is the best spot too
UNK_UNK Im just trying to figure out how everything fits. We have to need to set certain parameters based on others
UNK_UNK I was testing the lower diameter for less mass. Changed it back now
UNK_UNK wut
UNK_UNK actually we just gained mass and lost FOS so if you changed something go back
UNK_UNK The crankshaft bearing offset is something I need to know
UNK_UNK Pick an FS threshold and then minimize mass at that threshold
UNK_UNK can you go lower in weight while still being high fos?
UNK_UNK ask
UNK_UNK k
UNK_UNK That's odd. I see 40, but I will change it to 42
UNK_UNK someone changed it again
UNK_UNK got it, thanks
UNK_UNK (to everyone) Due to the small mass of my part I increased to max weight (0.05) and mas FOS (0.51)
UNK_UNK what..?
UNK_UNK piston says flywheel is lowest fos
UNK_UNK What variables do you have listed under Key Design Variables? I have (D), (c), (tf), and (ds)
UNK_UNK ill try
UNK_UNK how much does the crankshaft currently weigh?
UNK_UNK No mines the same
UNK_UNK Good job!
UNK_UNK mass/FOS?
UNK_UNK I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
UNK_UNK Do you have direct control over piston diameter (D)?
UNK_UNK c = 150 and dc = 45
UNK_UNK yeah for sure him
UNK_UNK We are hitting our requirements
UNK_UNK what is your ms?
UNK_UNK 1.67
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK piston thickness. 2-7 mm
UNK_UNK the bearing support offset?
UNK_UNK 1.71 (mass range: 1.13 to 3.12) and 4.55 (fos range: 4.55 to 0.44)
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK mass = 1.19
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK Yes, that's the minimum diameter I can use
UNK_UNK thickness, ratio of length of rod to length of crank and piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK what's the mass/fos of your subsystem? Mine currently is 0.99/9.09
UNK_UNK piston-pin is not responding
UNK_UNK Piston diameter
UNK_UNK Hey, what fos, do you think would be good enough, 1.5-2.25 ish?
UNK_UNK I guess everyone of us shall pick one to broad cast and see the global result and do iterations if needed
UNK_UNK Do you need any info from me?
UNK_UNK thats a good idea
UNK_UNK my mass is 3.57
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK weight let me update my design
UNK_UNK I only care about the crankshaft persons decisions
UNK_UNK im at c is 90
UNK_UNK No I didn't
UNK_UNK Piston-pin seems solid
UNK_UNK My FOS is 1.11
UNK_UNK ok mine is the largest. Im gonna decrease
UNK_UNK a mass of 58 for one component automatically puts us in the poor mark
UNK_UNK I have broadcasted the best value
UNK_UNK currently with the rod designer
UNK_UNK what values are you suggesting?
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK Current config is good remember these settings on your paper. Lets call this plan A
UNK_UNK what's your fos ?
UNK_UNK we got it, don't change things
UNK_UNK length of pin/ diameter of piston (higher is better)
UNK_UNK Ok, trying to figure out who's part weighs the most rn
UNK_UNK hahaha
UNK_UNK And the mass?
UNK_UNK If we could lower the offset, that would optimize my fos
UNK_UNK our value was really good did you make a change a second ago?
UNK_UNK Does increasing c increase the mass or decrease
UNK_UNK That's the minimum
UNK_UNK interstingly pisto-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK because it just skyrocketed
UNK_UNK Are you broadcasting?
UNK_UNK Sounds good I won't touch it
UNK_UNK I havent changed the broadcasted value so are you still seeing me change it?
UNK_UNK mine has been constant from last change
UNK_UNK ok my m is .53 and fos is 1929
UNK_UNK yeahh i think thats what happened to most people
UNK_UNK I reduced the diameter to 40mm to reduce the mass of the system
UNK_UNK we need to get this puppy down
UNK_UNK great job
UNK_UNK Ok.
UNK_UNK can we submit now?
UNK_UNK hmmm. okay  do u wnat to try that?
UNK_UNK no keep it low
UNK_UNK what is your current value for flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK Sorry, what is your current length
UNK_UNK I can't decrease mass anymore without going below a FOS of 2
UNK_UNK yeah we were at excellent and then someone changed it and now its poor
UNK_UNK What is your FOS?
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK Yeah, the flywheel won't break, so i was just minimizing mass
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK I do not
UNK_UNK do you have ds?
UNK_UNK the systemwide weight is kinda high
UNK_UNK i havnt changed anything
UNK_UNK our mass is too high rn
UNK_UNK im tryin g90 mm
UNK_UNK Who is broadcasting 0.69 right now?
UNK_UNK i havent broadccasted anything new
UNK_UNK Hey, we are dropping pretty low so try running parameters that you felt comfortable using earlier!
UNK_UNK okay, stay at that point
UNK_UNK Each part should be at 2
UNK_UNK In the current broadcast, the value is 15
UNK_UNK yeah it does now
UNK_UNK I can try and trim a little more tho]
UNK_UNK m at 1.63, fos at 53.27
UNK_UNK no i have both variables at a minimum because we got a verygood rating
UNK_UNK Piston pin designer said it is in very good range
UNK_UNK my mass is 1.71
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK Increase your mass slightly
UNK_UNK i can get my mass between 0.5 and 0.6, and still have a pretty high FOS
UNK_UNK maybe? what is yours
UNK_UNK i set my values to their minimum because i think we had excellent earlier
UNK_UNK whats your mass?
UNK_UNK is it ok to change the diameter value, there is a better alternative
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK range for piston is 0.45 to 4.43kg, 1.46 to 31.19 for FOS
UNK_UNK just kidding, back to poor. 
UNK_UNK what do you mean by ms
UNK_UNK have you considered using 75?
UNK_UNK true...
UNK_UNK sweet just a little bit more
UNK_UNK that looks good
UNK_UNK while keeping the fos fixed
UNK_UNK 100
UNK_UNK yuh
UNK_UNK under performance requirements
UNK_UNK we are in excellent right now
UNK_UNK we just need ot cut a bit of weight where possible
UNK_UNK great
UNK_UNK next smallest i can go to is 75 and thats the minimum
UNK_UNK are you broadcasting the values giving that weight?
UNK_UNK 82.5 i was thinking, the piston pin designer wants the bore size to be minimal
UNK_UNK did you change something?
UNK_UNK The piston bore diameter could be larger and my weight would still be ok. I'm at 0.1
UNK_UNK it's very good right now
UNK_UNK do you know why?
UNK_UNK im at 1.23 FOS as well and cant get above that unless we change piston diamter to 40
UNK_UNK yeah no where you the one who ran the simulation and got very good
UNK_UNK yeah sounds good
UNK_UNK We need to decrease mass a lot
UNK_UNK i got barely any points on the third problem
UNK_UNK We need to save weight.
UNK_UNK updated my mass to 1.19
UNK_UNK Can you make your weight any lower with an FOS above 2?
UNK_UNK I have not been having a lot of luck, try something like 110mm
UNK_UNK Do we want to end with very good?
UNK_UNK increase* sorry
UNK_UNK 2.95 is my minimum, I can't go lower unless we decrease the piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Do you have a factor of safety above 2.06?
UNK_UNK yeah
UNK_UNK that makes sense.  i just maxed my fos right now
UNK_UNK for c = 85 dc = 15 ds = 25 tf= 30 D = 70 fos = 2.37
UNK_UNK on the projector
UNK_UNK Fos could increase with increase in mass but if it's already so high I don't think it matters, right?
UNK_UNK Keeping it 45!
UNK_UNK ok i increased dc and it got better?
UNK_UNK yeah increasing D changes mass by an enormous amount, like change of five adds 5 to ms
UNK_UNK cuz mine depends on that
UNK_UNK If I drop my weight way down though my fos is super trash
UNK_UNK But FOS is low
UNK_UNK so 225 could work
UNK_UNK Okay. great
UNK_UNK Fair! okay hold on, plenty of time to plan out the next move
UNK_UNK Nicole who dis?
UNK_UNK is your fos still 2.01 ?
UNK_UNK flywheel changed a value and i lost 5 lbs!
UNK_UNK raising it now
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK We are GOOD
UNK_UNK t = 8
UNK_UNK can you vut the mass by any chance?
UNK_UNK Group: alert everyone before you change anything!
UNK_UNK I do not control that.  All I can do is the ratio of L:r, and it's not called L1
UNK_UNK no my design variables are Thickness of the I-section and the Conrod length to crank length ratio
UNK_UNK I can ask but I'm worried not everyone's was updated
UNK_UNK it doesnt have to be that high
UNK_UNK require: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK we desperately need to reduce weight
UNK_UNK It's down to 3.22 with the current bore diameter
UNK_UNK trying to max fos and min weight
UNK_UNK piston is 0.83
UNK_UNK were they significantly different twenty minutes ago?
UNK_UNK Try to lower it to 2
UNK_UNK )group: we are at good! hold on!
UNK_UNK I think flywheel changed something and isnt speaking
UNK_UNK Only the loest matters, so there's no need for anything above 2
UNK_UNK Im using the minimum possible values and cant change much more
UNK_UNK If I increase flywheel the thickness, and diameter, the mass increases, but the FOS decreases.
UNK_UNK 2.36
UNK_UNK I think our current mass is larger than what we started
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go back
UNK_UNK ?
UNK_UNK gotcha, my FOS stays realtivcly high with low mass so I shouldn't have too mcuh effect on overall weight
UNK_UNK need: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK It looks to me like a smaller bearing offset gives both lower mass and higher factor of safety, so I'm thinking about keeping it smaller
UNK_UNK my mass is 5.2 and fos is 3.91
UNK_UNK I think we should go with 40
UNK_UNK its huge its 15886
UNK_UNK What did u choose for D?
UNK_UNK I have a high FOS for everywhere in my combination of ranges
UNK_UNK go for the lower Ms that has an FS above 2
UNK_UNK 1.29
UNK_UNK refresh it
UNK_UNK We had a better FOS and less mass before so if you changed anything go bac
UNK_UNK very bad change
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK Crap. I wish it would update automaticly
UNK_UNK yo the far right column, should we just pick the one with the lowest ms and highest fos
UNK_UNK nice
UNK_UNK maybe use a  smaller c
UNK_UNK i was kidding about 3d
UNK_UNK mine: ms 1.07, fos 35.82
UNK_UNK we have our fos up, try reducing the amss
UNK_UNK do you have any lower weight options above 2.06
UNK_UNK perfect
UNK_UNK connecting rod said their values weren't significantly different twenty minutes ago
UNK_UNK those are my values
UNK_UNK is it possible for that to go lower
UNK_UNK interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
UNK_UNK did u get the light sensor working
UNK_UNK yes sir (or maam)
UNK_UNK Great
UNK_UNK are you chaning values and updating your broadcast?
UNK_UNK Oops, my thickness is 10 mm
UNK_UNK yup just got that, asked piston to lower his mass. Just to see
UNK_UNK what is yours?
UNK_UNK Wanna call it?
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK is diameter 90
UNK_UNK Cool
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK i have mass for the shaft at 18.63, fs=2.06
UNK_UNK Don't touch anything. We're in EXCELLENT
UNK_UNK what values are you using for the input poston bore diameter?
UNK_UNK cut
UNK_UNK group: nobody depends on what i change. so ill edit last.
UNK_UNK I'm broadcasting my lowest I got
UNK_UNK is this scooter
UNK_UNK it costs money
UNK_UNK I am updating my pin now to get a FOS of about 2.1 and reduce the mass
UNK_UNK what parameters do you have?
UNK_UNK first day on the job or something?
UNK_UNK what are your weight and fos values
UNK_UNK My mass is like 1mm thick away from being its minimal value
UNK_UNK are you using my dc dimension?
UNK_UNK maybe we should just call it good
UNK_UNK if i make the piston diameter smaller, my FOS goes up
UNK_UNK 1.35, I wonder who has 0.61
UNK_UNK Sick, our engine is now excellent
UNK_UNK ok never mind then
UNK_UNK Whats up
UNK_UNK try to find a good combination at D=40
UNK_UNK piston change: cur m = 1.0kg , cur fos = 4.56
UNK_UNK yes agreed
UNK_UNK What about you?
UNK_UNK yee it has been good working with you as well
UNK_UNK I am trying but it lowers my fos as well. I'll see if I can do anything furhter
UNK_UNK Nope must be the other two that need that
UNK_UNK I set the crankshaft to the lowest mass (m = .16, fs = 3.34). Sending this to everyone
UNK_UNK Fair!
UNK_UNK yep raised it
UNK_UNK We do
UNK_UNK ok yeye
UNK_UNK ok thx
UNK_UNK Is your offset still the same?
UNK_UNK uf
UNK_UNK smaller gives me a much better fos
UNK_UNK can you decrease the weight a bit maybe
UNK_UNK I didnt change anything
UNK_UNK yeah change it back
UNK_UNK i have m = 0.07 and fos at 1.23
UNK_UNK oh true
UNK_UNK diameter is 25
UNK_UNK we need less mass folks
UNK_UNK ms was 2.79
UNK_UNK Do you have a value for the crankshaft bearing offset (c)
UNK_UNK 0.52
UNK_UNK piston can increase FOS if i move D = 75. we are going to both adjust it now
UNK_UNK back at 80
UNK_UNK I changed mine back
UNK_UNK can you broadcaset 150?
UNK_UNK try going up by 1, try making it 41,42,43..
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK if we all go for similar fos at around 3 we should be able to get global fos as 3 right?
UNK_UNK whats your FOS if you drop mass by 3kg
UNK_UNK crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK what mare mass values around an fos of 2
UNK_UNK KK
UNK_UNK y'all we need to get the FS to 2
UNK_UNK yeah u should probs freeze
UNK_UNK i have 1.27
UNK_UNK and we need all the help we can get with fs
UNK_UNK We're still seeing 80 as the globally broadcast value. Weird.
UNK_UNK kk ill test
UNK_UNK awesome, i think this will help. Should I go to my lowest setting or no? Im on my second to lowest setting right now
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK Factor of safety is minimum. So one of us has a FoS of 1. Is it you?
UNK_UNK dc is crank-pin diameter
UNK_UNK Yeah I noticed the same thing
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK mass 8.84 fos 4.39
UNK_UNK so hows life
UNK_UNK Thanks
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK nice work!
UNK_UNK got it, thanks
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK ok don't change anything
UNK_UNK try not to change anything until you talk to someone
UNK_UNK mass shot up, we back to very good did you change
UNK_UNK I will be using 40mm going forward
UNK_UNK on my screen it says your limit is between 150 and 300?
UNK_UNK The weight will go over if I increase diameter
UNK_UNK Can you lower your diameter a touch? My options depend only on that.
UNK_UNK Go fast theyre giving out the money
UNK_UNK I chose 40mm which is minimum value but crankshaft said it's good for him or her if I use maximum value
UNK_UNK no 20 for him
UNK_UNK I'm pretty sure I will leave the thickness at 10 mm
UNK_UNK kool
UNK_UNK what bore diameter are you thinking?
UNK_UNK sorry yes, 90 mm for bore D, I control the r values
UNK_UNK do you know if each part has a specific fos requirement ?
UNK_UNK these are the same values I had for the "very good" design
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK What variables do you control?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK Did you make that change?
UNK_UNK only the crankshaft offset
UNK_UNK from flywheel: flywheeldesign variables: Flywheel thickness,Flywheel shaft dia,flywheelneed: crankshaft bearing offset
UNK_UNK do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK Ok.
UNK_UNK broadcasting
UNK_UNK i have 2.0 so I have the lowest fos
UNK_UNK please please try and get those sorted out ASAP and let me know if you need anything.  look at all your already run simulations and pick out the lowest mass and FOS then set your values to those
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK Thats fine.
UNK_UNK what's your fos ?
UNK_UNK for some reason i cant go that low
UNK_UNK New crankshaft pin diameter: 45. Broadcast is updated
UNK_UNK so someone is low
UNK_UNK group: one change at a time! let crankshaft change and then he/she can let us know!
UNK_UNK No, because I haven't needed to. I'm mainly trying to coordinate everyone else now.
UNK_UNK ill try cut a bit of weight with ds
UNK_UNK whats your mass at the moment
UNK_UNK Currently have a simulation at c=150, dc=50 ds=40 tf=51 D=105 with projected output ms=23.24 and fos=3.96
UNK_UNK we are at very good
UNK_UNK Make sure everyone is using the dimensions for the most updated broadcast. I think someone's dimensions aren't lining up.
UNK_UNK nice. So we need to fine someone who can reduce ewight
UNK_UNK someones has to be that .5 though right
UNK_UNK honestly the best bet for me would be a fos of above two and make the smallest weight possible
UNK_UNK now it says 2.03
UNK_UNK I'm about to drop the fos and mass because rod designer said it might help them
UNK_UNK We get $17 if no one touches anything! Save your values lol.
UNK_UNK OK
UNK_UNK ive been at the first broadcast for a while now
UNK_UNK Hi! If you have an initial parameter set ready, please go ahead and broadcast the same. I feel we should start with the lowest mass configuration and increase mass later on as required for FOS. Thanks
UNK_UNK yeah i have no idea how it got changed lol
UNK_UNK Do you need anything from me?
UNK_UNK I am staying at m 0.07 and fs 1.23
UNK_UNK Can you send me your mass?
UNK_UNK Yeah, that was nice
UNK_UNK c and d_c
UNK_UNK I'm communicating now
UNK_UNK from when it was at excellent
UNK_UNK okay so lower D is better?
UNK_UNK we should figure out who's FOS is 0.44
UNK_UNK TRUE
UNK_UNK i feel like we care about the lowest Fos of all subsystems
UNK_UNK i can increase fos by 1.2 piston (Me)if someone can decrease their mass by .9
UNK_UNK any updates?
UNK_UNK Can we try to increase FOS beyond 2.01?
UNK_UNK my highest FS is 1.23
UNK_UNK I think L1 does affect me though
UNK_UNK everyone change it back to where it was a minute ago
UNK_UNK I have control over piston head thickness and bore diameter
UNK_UNK Will making the bore diameter smaller improve your FOS?
UNK_UNK still mass = 9.86 and fos = 7.98
UNK_UNK alright, I can get 2.77 with that value for D, Do you plan on changing D?
UNK_UNK group: I can make piston head thickness 10.5, and diameter 90
UNK_UNK we need mass to be less than 3
UNK_UNK Do I have any variables that affect your result?
UNK_UNK Let's not change whatever we have
UNK_UNK nope my fos is 5625
UNK_UNK my variables are t_I = 7.5 and r1 = 4.
UNK_UNK im not changing anything...
UNK_UNK .05 for mass
UNK_UNK idk
UNK_UNK If that reduces your fos
UNK_UNK I'm trying to find out what everyone's FS is. crankshafter has theirs at 3.62
UNK_UNK GOOD***
UNK_UNK Mine's still 2.95
UNK_UNK GROUP: let me alter some things real quick
UNK_UNK Do you have piston bore diameter?(D)
UNK_UNK )group: we are at good! hold on!
UNK_UNK Alright. I'm on lowest bore diameter now. Mass = .91, FOS = 7.37
UNK_UNK does a higher or lower bore diameter benefit you?
UNK_UNK Ok. I now have FOS options over 1
UNK_UNK try to decrease you mass while keeping a FOS above 2
UNK_UNK we are so close
UNK_UNK sorry hit the wrong button fixed it
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK nope mine has been at 1.27
UNK_UNK my objective is to maximize it
UNK_UNK nope dont thing so
UNK_UNK message back when you did it
UNK_UNK Our FOS just went down to 0.96. Is yours still good?
UNK_UNK hello
UNK_UNK I imagine these would contribute to more mass
UNK_UNK just 0.12
UNK_UNK Ok. With my current design, mass is 0.53 and Fs is 2.1
UNK_UNK Yeah
UNK_UNK Im gonna do 150 instead
UNK_UNK I have control of thickness of I-section, conrod length and the crank length
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK Fs = 2.04
UNK_UNK I don't think so
UNK_UNK ok so 2.96 is actually Good, we need to improve FOS to get it to Good
UNK_UNK can you try making it a bit bigger?
UNK_UNK my graphs don't show up so i'm somewhat limited
UNK_UNK 0.55
UNK_UNK we are in excellent rn
UNK_UNK how
UNK_UNK Sounds Good. I am currently at Fs = 2.85
UNK_UNK That would increase mass. Do you mean go down?
UNK_UNK I don't think so, all I need is piston bore diameter
UNK_UNK Its probably weighted. If we can raise the lowest fos to its max and the highest fos to its min mass it might work
UNK_UNK 3.11
UNK_UNK Yes but that will also reduce fos and I am the lowest at 1.45 rn
UNK_UNK hi
UNK_UNK ahhh okay
UNK_UNK aight bet
UNK_UNK So I think my subsytem is heaviest so I need to drop weight as much as possible, while other lighter subsystems make up for increased FOS
UNK_UNK how about you?
UNK_UNK i have been
UNK_UNK Good job
UNK_UNK mass = 1.63 and fos = 8 for that value
UNK_UNK lol sorry for the repeat
UNK_UNK sorry 60
UNK_UNK group-piston pin now
UNK_UNK I haven't touched any
UNK_UNK we just need to cut a bit of mass where possible
UNK_UNK I have broadcasted the best value
UNK_UNK Gotcha
UNK_UNK hot dog
UNK_UNK Will keep you updated
UNK_UNK but no one changed anything i believe
UNK_UNK mine still says fair
UNK_UNK How is your FOS related to my pin parameters?
UNK_UNK do you think increase fos of lighter componet while decreasing fos of my part will work?
UNK_UNK nope you're good
UNK_UNK fos is 1.92 and mass is 1.46
UNK_UNK correct
UNK_UNK Increase
UNK_UNK What is your FOS and mass at currently?
UNK_UNK cool.  not touching anything
UNK_UNK increase your FOS!!
UNK_UNK no i don't need that
UNK_UNK 150 mm
UNK_UNK Can you try decreasing diameter back to 45?
UNK_UNK mass? sorry, i am between 0.5 and 0.6
UNK_UNK thickness = 8
UNK_UNK They said they'd broadcast it, but yeah, still 80. IDK what's going on.
UNK_UNK okay
UNK_UNK and what ive been telling the others hahah
UNK_UNK we gotta talk
UNK_UNK i'm having the best value now
UNK_UNK Ideally we can help them out and find the optimal form for all our systems
UNK_UNK our mass is the only thing to change now
UNK_UNK will let you know in few minutes
UNK_UNK D, d_s, and t_f, but I don't know how to use those
UNK_UNK we are soooo close
UNK_UNK M = 0.05 FOS = 2.03
UNK_UNK ok i need bore diameter too but I don't control any of your stuff
UNK_UNK Yeah, I'm leaving mine as is for now. Trying to figure out why our total mass is so high.
UNK_UNK What external variables affect your design?
UNK_UNK 82.5 actually
UNK_UNK i wont move mine again
UNK_UNK mass is 3 and fos is 1.44
UNK_UNK If you reduce FOS to around 2, can we reduce weight?
UNK_UNK maybe just the mass, the broadcast has a very large mass
UNK_UNK my fos is over 4000
UNK_UNK Are you changing youre values?
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK but we also need to make all the parts to fit each other I think
UNK_UNK do you need it to be higher or  lower?
UNK_UNK I can choose diameter between 75 and 105
UNK_UNK wait now we're very good
UNK_UNK Ok, that's odd
UNK_UNK Yeah it keeps showing up as poor for me as well. Let me play with the piston some more. I was looking at the auto engine and didn't see how small our mass had to be
UNK_UNK Is your FOS twelve hundred??!
UNK_UNK Whoever last made change go back, it was very good
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK The smaller offset works well for smaller flywheel dimensions but the FS is higher overall with larger dimensions
UNK_UNK ok guys looks good
UNK_UNK alright, guess no then
UNK_UNK The piston pin is pretty important though so id say maximize mass for fos if you can
UNK_UNK *I have c and dc (c increases mass decreases FOS) (dc increases mass and FOS)
UNK_UNK we are in excellent!
UNK_UNK Same for me my fos drops waaaay down and shaves only 0.12 from m
UNK_UNK It increases the mass a lot
UNK_UNK I do not know how that measurement will affect my parts. I dont need them, fos = 0.71 now
UNK_UNK what parameters do you have?
UNK_UNK we have exceleent
UNK_UNK what are your design variables?
UNK_UNK let me check
UNK_UNK anything you can do to lower the weight with changing the FOS too much?
UNK_UNK who got very good and broadcast those values
UNK_UNK me either
UNK_UNK Also, be sure to tell me if the bore diameter changes.
UNK_UNK we need smaller mass
UNK_UNK 3.91
UNK_UNK 3
UNK_UNK Lowest FOS is the system FOS btw
UNK_UNK yea we need to figure out whos value changed
UNK_UNK one minute ago fos is amazing yet now lol it's so bad
UNK_UNK I'm just doing what he tells me tbh
UNK_UNK nah, I assume you're talking about the piston bore diameter right?
UNK_UNK sounds good
UNK_UNK group: so FOS is good now lets concentrate on slight weight reductions
UNK_UNK can you change yours? Piston and flywheel just changed theres
UNK_UNK Do it. Make mass as small as possible while still sitting above 2.
UNK_UNK we need to cut down on mass
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK yeah it does but all of the fos have been over 2 except one of them
UNK_UNK gg
UNK_UNK fos?
UNK_UNK lol great
UNK_UNK Our fos just dropped again
UNK_UNK It just looks like the FOS went down a lot
UNK_UNK i just rebroadcasted
UNK_UNK tf value of 10
UNK_UNK okay wait
UNK_UNK think low fos is from piston pin
UNK_UNK Diameter = 40 mm
UNK_UNK elaborate.  Are there any tradeoffs?
UNK_UNK or over 1.5 at the minimum
UNK_UNK Based on their mass of 1.66, they take up half the weight of the system. So anything that we can do in order to reduce that is important.
UNK_UNK my maxium fos is 1.35
UNK_UNK and which do you need
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK yeahh i realized that when she got up
UNK_UNK The conrod hasn't changed anything
UNK_UNK whoever changed it change back
UNK_UNK 2.77
UNK_UNK oh noooo go back
UNK_UNK what mass are you working with?
UNK_UNK i can get higher fos with relatively low m so maybe we can leverage this
UNK_UNK are you the conrod designer
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the connecting rod
UNK_UNK the program won't let me go any lower
UNK_UNK Mine is at 4.55
UNK_UNK Yeah, I was looking at the factor of safety and realized that with the head so small, the FOS wasn't gonna go up
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK what is the thickness you have on that right now with a d=15?
UNK_UNK Yes
UNK_UNK for m=3.48
UNK_UNK Alright, I will try to figure that out
UNK_UNK A FOS of higher than 1000?
UNK_UNK sweet
UNK_UNK mass = 9.86
UNK_UNK I have broadcasted the best value
UNK_UNK Thats great, any way you can reduce weight more then?
UNK_UNK okay cool everyone responded
UNK_UNK we just need mass down so try to find a similar value in terms of FOS but lower mass
UNK_UNK Thank you
UNK_UNK We need to cut the weight to get it reasonable
UNK_UNK Whats your FOS
UNK_UNK 40
UNK_UNK and the Flywheel shaft diameter to be 15
UNK_UNK Great - makes sense.  that's my job lol
UNK_UNK 75
UNK_UNK or maybe two or three are tied
UNK_UNK ok our current broadcast is 'excellent', so are we done here?
UNK_UNK Yea. Our dimensions line up, so there may be miscommunication among other members
UNK_UNK Hello
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK group - go to mid range, follow crankshaft lead
UNK_UNK we can tone it down some still
UNK_UNK we are currently at very good. are anyones values different from what they were when we were at excellent?
UNK_UNK FOS 2.06
UNK_UNK someone is messing this up, are values are getting very bad
UNK_UNK I am going to increase the piston diameter, could you tell me if that increases or decreases your FOS?
UNK_UNK pretty sure no one
UNK_UNK No, not that I know of
UNK_UNK Same goes for you.  Is your FOS above 1.5?
UNK_UNK cool
UNK_UNK okay!
UNK_UNK did you change something after excellent
UNK_UNK so lower piston diamter lowers your fos?
UNK_UNK bearing is 150, pin is 50 mm
UNK_UNK Actually our mass is already way over, I'll probably keep it the same
UNK_UNK make sure crank shaft guy knows that and try to figure out how an increase or decrease in that effect the FOS and the mass
UNK_UNK whats your fos ?
UNK_UNK I am at my lowest mass possible
UNK_UNK yo we got excellent
UNK_UNK from crankshaft: crankshaftmy design variables: c (bearing support offset), dc (crank-pin diameter))) crankshaftrequire: piston bore diameter (D), flywheel shaft diameter (ds), flywheel thickness (tf))
UNK_UNK so i got an fos of 3.39 and mass of 0.11
UNK_UNK Thank you. Will you please update me if it changes by more than 5?
UNK_UNK Alright, thank you!
UNK_UNK yeah, what is it?
UNK_UNK We need to reduce mass if possible
UNK_UNK mines at 2.27
UNK_UNK fos>2 and m<35
UNK_UNK t = 10
UNK_UNK my FOS is 2.01
UNK_UNK Still 40mm. Will increasing bore help your design?
UNK_UNK So for my part, the FOS are always very high, so I would be lowing the mass, if your part has low fos please don't hesitate to increase mass
UNK_UNK stop changing
UNK_UNK record your current value
UNK_UNK you change let me lose 5 lbs! Thanks fellow engineer!!!
UNK_UNK sweeeeeet
UNK_UNK Crankshaft just brought up perhaps the person with the lowest FOS will fail first, so they're FOS is the most important. What do you think?
UNK_UNK Lets all maximize our fos and try to cut mass instead
UNK_UNK It went down again
UNK_UNK 40 would work as well if that helps
UNK_UNK Does a higher or lower diameter work better for the crankshaft
UNK_UNK dont move
UNK_UNK hmm, anything I can do to help reduce your mass?
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK its 1.92
UNK_UNK nah
UNK_UNK I have the 2nd lowest possible mass selected for my part
UNK_UNK me too
UNK_UNK can anyone reduce weight without changing fos?
UNK_UNK gg team
UNK_UNK minimize the weight of crankshaft and increase fos
UNK_UNK how did the mass go up
UNK_UNK what mass are we all thinking cuz we need to be under 35
UNK_UNK the piston is the part that affects all the others as no one elses affects me so im staying at my set values
UNK_UNK >:(((((((((((
UNK_UNK No idea
UNK_UNK Do you know whose FOS is the lowest at the moment?
UNK_UNK What does your system FS value say? mine are all like over 4000 even when i minimize mass
UNK_UNK yes
UNK_UNK what are you working on?
UNK_UNK whats your current FOS ?
UNK_UNK lowest I could do is 75 for the weight
UNK_UNK The piston has a diameter of 75
UNK_UNK I was talking with another guy and I think we just need to optimize each parts maybe advantages.
UNK_UNK What is your FS
UNK_UNK Are you still at 160 for support offset?
UNK_UNK no i do not. i am compiling everyones
UNK_UNK im using a 40
UNK_UNK I changed my FOS to around 30 by adding 0.07 kg
UNK_UNK we were at 3.5 mass and 1.5 fos but now it is worse
UNK_UNK mass?
UNK_UNK no
UNK_UNK i dont know where to reduce the weight tho
UNK_UNK lmk what you think
UNK_UNK My current fos is 5625.56
UNK_UNK group: go to you lower most range with max fos and reasonable weight
UNK_UNK mine is 1215
UNK_UNK My current fos in my table is 1.11
UNK_UNK What testbed variables do you have?
UNK_UNK Ye i think so, mine for just my part is 3.84
UNK_UNK Sounds good. Looks like our issue is in the crankshaft then
UNK_UNK thats the most central point in my simulation
UNK_UNK We have a good FOS so don't drastically change anyhting
UNK_UNK with piston d = 75, bearing 150, flywheel 12 and shaft 60, we have a FS .12 above 2, but our mass is just a little high
UNK_UNK Piston diameter of 75
UNK_UNK if u want to adjust urs, u can announce to all chats
UNK_UNK wait which two is it? the two directly behind us? or the one sitting like further right?
UNK_UNK Is it better for the thickness of the flywheel to be larger or smaller? What about the flywheel shaft diameter?
UNK_UNK makes sense
UNK_UNK looks like we're good
UNK_UNK 2.43 which is a bit high
UNK_UNK That is my current max FOS. It can change some based on what piston diameter I have
UNK_UNK what option are you currently on
UNK_UNK good job!
UNK_UNK Who changed it
UNK_UNK hah punnnnnnny
UNK_UNK the dream team
UNK_UNK 0.57
UNK_UNK Right now I have it broadcasted at 55
UNK_UNK the values I have broadcasted should generate max FOS
UNK_UNK He changed it and it went to very good
UNK_UNK whenever I lower my factor of safety it seems to be having a large effect on the overall value for just a small change in mass
UNK_UNK excellent is above 2 but with mass lower than 2
UNK_UNK (bearing support offset and crank pin diameter)
UNK_UNK Are you having troubles with FOS?
UNK_UNK No. My values have been the same since about 9:45.
UNK_UNK i have 3.27 kg and 1.23 fos
UNK_UNK _ _ _ ; _ O _ ; _ _ _
UNK_UNK flywheel boi is tryna improve
UNK_UNK did you get FOS as 1.81?
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK working on it
UNK_UNK m_s : 14.55;   fos_s : 9.04;
UNK_UNK 47.5
UNK_UNK ok somehow we now have way too much mass
UNK_UNK noooooooooooo
UNK_UNK no idea
UNK_UNK just leave it im fine with very good
UNK_UNK see what the other group members say
UNK_UNK is it ok to change the diameter value, there is a better alternative
UNK_UNK try reducing C?
UNK_UNK the broadcast still shows 40
UNK_UNK I mean something changed and made it go back down to very good, but I didn't change anything, did you?
UNK_UNK I'm trying to minimize the mass of the connecting rod
UNK_UNK i have to choose the heaviest part now
UNK_UNK i wonder if they read these as part of the study...
UNK_UNK with D=53, i got m=0.13kg and Fos = 3.18
UNK_UNK lets gooo
UNK_UNK Sounds good
UNK_UNK My sim shows m=29.24, f=2.83
UNK_UNK oh I see
UNK_UNK okay, I'll try using that now
UNK_UNK currently 1.64
UNK_UNK yeah im not sure either. trying to find out
UNK_UNK 0.11
UNK_UNK what is your mass?
UNK_UNK reply when done
UNK_UNK let me check
UNK_UNK I Havent updated in awhile so my numbers are ms: 3.64 Fs:6.92
UNK_UNK I think my part is probably the lightest so if we need to bump up the FS, I can make my part heavier
UNK_UNK what is your FOS?
UNK_UNK increases FOS and mass
UNK_UNK 9.09
UNK_UNK Yes. FOS looking good
UNK_UNK yeah we are now at very good
UNK_UNK If you changed anything since we got FAIR, please change it back! Then we can regroup and figure out next steps. (sending this to everyone)
UNK_UNK Gotcha. This is harder than if we had a group chat \
UNK_UNK diameter and flywheel thickness
UNK_UNK nope
UNK_UNK What is the mass of your components?
UNK_UNK time is up it says on my system
UNK_UNK i think the other designers are gridlocked as far as influencing the factor of safetuy
UNK_UNK ok
UNK_UNK hello?
UNK_UNK Havent heard back from piston though
UNK_UNK increasing diameter decreases fos?
UNK_UNK My bad, currently at best option. Lowest mass, higher Fos
UNK_UNK nobofy left the room did they?
UNK_UNK is 60 the minimum you can go with the crankshaft
UNK_UNK Mass is 2.5, fos is 0.57
UNK_UNK i can't go lower than this
UNK_UNK yeah i cant change anything. We done?
UNK_UNK ???
UNK_UNK lets just try getting our mass down
UNK_UNK i have mine with the fos closest to 2 and lowest mass i can get
UNK_UNK lolololol
UNK_UNK what mass are you getting?
UNK_UNK 0.24
UNK_UNK group: i changed my part!
UNK_UNK mine is 1200
UNK_UNK my foss is 12708.83 which makes no sense to me
UNK_UNK agreed
UNK_UNK just went up to .51 overall
UNK_UNK ok change it to 84 and see what happens
UNK_UNK yes i do
UNK_UNK How is the factor of safety
UNK_UNK nobody touch anything haha
UNK_UNK What are your values now?
UNK_UNK yep
UNK_UNK What is your FOS right now?
UNK_UNK you got it
UNK_UNK Would it be possible for you to increase your fos?
UNK_UNK Wait, did you just change a value?
UNK_UNK It doesn't as far as I know, but the length of the crankshaft does. What is your current value for r?
