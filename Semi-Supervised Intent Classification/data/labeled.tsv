Sugg_Info can increase diameter is we need higher fos
Request_Help make sure it's broadcasting propperyly, I've had to click it a couple times to get it to show for all
Prov_Info min of 40
Prov_Info Just updated
Acc_Info Alright I can definitely work with that
Prov_Info Hello pistonpin. The crankshaft doesn't dep3end directly on your system, but please tell me if anything that I do affects you.
Prov_Info I'm currently at 40 mm diameter, which is giving me better results than the 45 mm
Prov_Info i haven't changed anything. My fos is 3.96 and mass is 30.51 (crankshaft is heavy for any situation)
Prov_Info If I reduce my mass by .03, it reduces FOS by .25 to 1.76
Prov_Info Mine should be broadcasting
Enq_Info what's your component range of weights?
Monitoring_Obj Based on my simulations, it seems like a smaller value of (c) will result in an overall higher FOS, do you agree?
Explore_Param We are toeing the 3 kg limit though, I'm probably just going to keep ds = 15
Acc_Info ok, seems like not a huge difference
Acc_Info gotcha
Prov_Info just updated my broadcast to the minimum values for both
Enq_Info based on c = 60?
Sugg_Info In that case it would be more valuable to keep the lower ds value to conserve mass
Sugg_Info cool, can you get your mass any lower?
Enq_Info what are your current values? Parameters you chose
Prov_Info for tf = 10 & ds = 15; m = 0.52 and FOS = 1215.12
Explore_Param I can probably drop some mass out of my part, but can also take that out of other parts
Enq_Info what are your current values?
Underst_Dep mine is optimized with m = 0.12 and fos = 3.44 when you have D = 40
Enq_Info How much does your mass range by
Acc_Info okay
Prov_Info Range of weights was 1.49 to 4.81. My broadcast uses 1.49 with FOS = 4.55
Monitoring_Obj Think I optimized my part with m = .52 and FOS = 2.01
Prov_Info tf = 10, ds = 25
Prov_Info individually 2.47
Acc_Info Sure thing
Prov_Info Increasing ds will increase mass and FOS
Underst_Dep Yeah but 45 should be fine if you dont want to go lower
Enq_Info Can you send me your current values?
Acc_Info okay we're still above a factor of safety of 2 thought so don't worry about it
Acc_Info now it says fair
Enq_Info So the lower D is the better it is for me
Sugg_Info Rn were under mass so if you need to you could increase it a bit
Acc_Info ok. do what you can
Acc_Info we do, I just noticed
Acc_Info Yeah
Enq_Info Hey I am the conrod I was curious as to what you thought a good piston diameter would be?
Underst_Dep Can you max out the ds value to see what happens?
Enq_Info What are your current values?
Prov_Info we're back to very good
Enq_Info alright, what fos #s are you getting. my lowest fos situation is still 323
Prov_Info mine still says excellent, but i have not changed anythign 
Prov_Info I have m = 0.12 and fos = 3.44 for D = 40
Monitoring_Obj Not sure. But 0.03 is not a lot of mass
Prov_Info my system is probably not the limiting part
Enq_Info Whats the effect of D on your results?
Acc_Info ok for sure
Monitoring_Obj im at a FOS of just over 2, so I think I'm good unless we need to cut more mass
Explore_Param yeah, the overall mass went up, so I'm about to raise my mass and drop the fos one of the other designers asked me to 
Prov_Info yeah, I haven't changed anything 
Sugg_Info any FOS higher than 2 gets us nothing more, we need to drop mass
Prov_Info I now have minimum fos but i further decreased my mass
Prov_Info I asked if they changed their broadcasted values from excellent.
Prov_Info I am using the best results that I have, where c is minimum and d_c is maximum. Inve tried other things but that is my best by far, and is the only solution I have uploaded
Acc_Info Awesome job!
Prov_Info I don't know what has changed. Ill rebroadcast what I had when we were good.
Prov_Info I'm currentlt at FOS of 2.07, so I', not the low
Acc_Info Thank you for the information
Prov_Info Keeping it at 40 works best for me, what about the others?
Sugg_Info Try and minimize your mass but keep fos above 2
Enq_Info what's your mass and FOS
Acc_Info Sounds good! I just tried my middle values and will broadcast that.
Acc_Info Cool
Prov_Info nevermind, back at excellent now.
Prov_Info the mass went up a lot
Enq_Info whats your fos
Explore_Param Yes, but I'm iterating to determine dependence on other parameters rn
Prov_Info If you could reduce your "tf" variable that would be great :)
Acc_Info sounds good. I think yours was the only one changing
Prov_Info Ok. My FOS values range from 1 to 8
Prov_Info ah i menat 1.47
Prov_Info I have now , I canchange it back
Prov_Info interestingly piston-pin is the only fos under 2, but the whole fos is still quite low
Prov_Info just updated my broadcast. Mass of mine is 1.49
Prov_Info 45 seems decent
Prov_Info conrod length to crank length ration (r) = 3
Enq_Info Have you been changing your broadcasted values since we were at excellent?
Prov_Info It doesnt affect my mass because I'm the pin designer
Request_Help rn I only see our global FOS as 0.57 and mass as 2.16?
Acc_Info Yeah I agree
Enq_Info Was there a particular reason why you asked about maxing out ds?
Enq_Info does it help you if I reduce that value at all?
Prov_Info No I don't think so
Explore_Param let me play around with some numbers
Prov_Info I haven't changed my broadcast
Monitoring_Obj Increasing "c" increases the mass and decreases the FOS
Prov_Info I just lowered it to 25.23. That is low for the crankshaft
Prov_Info Not much
Enq_Info do you change the piston diameter at all
Prov_Info Our current design is excellent! I am not sure how we did that, but I am happy!
Monitoring_Obj If you increase your D what does that do to mass?
Sugg_Info Can you cut any more mass out and get closer to FOS  = 2
Prov_Info Hi piston! My crankshaft depends on your bore diameter. I don't yet know how, but it will probably help that you know.
Prov_Info I lowered my mass by about 5 lbs
Acc_Info Perfect
Sugg_Info leave yours as is for now, piston is biggest factor rn
Enq_Info Have you changed the system at all? Our quality has dropped.
Underst_Dep Isn't the system FOS only dependent on the lowest value out of all the subsystems?
Prov_Info 40 works for me
Prov_Info also, if you click check for broadcast at the top it says we're at excellent
Prov_Info m = .52, FOS = 2.02
Enq_Info Hi, I need the piston diameter D
Prov_Info I've just broadcasted the most recent simulation but this will definitely not be the final one.
Prov_Info I posted a new broadcast that better meets my requirements
Enq_Info Hey! How does the value of my crank pin diameter affect your design?
Acc_Info I am also happy :)
Prov_Info i changed my mass to a lower value and updated it and it says the mass went up
Prov_Info which are bearing support offest and crank-pin diameter respectivly
Monitoring_Obj is there anyway you could lower the weight and fos to just above 2
Underst_Dep What's keeping the piston bore from being minimized to 75, if I may ask? I think we were hitting an "excellent" rating when it was at 75 earlier.
Underst_Dep How does the piston bore diameter affect the overall design parameters?
Underst_Dep How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize FOS?
Prov_Info My flywheel also depends on your crankshaft bearing offset (c)
Prov_Info Dope
Prov_Info I decreased ds to 15 mm to conserve some mass, as my FOS values are all greater than 300
Underst_Dep is there a bore diameter you are set on? or are you still experimenting?
Enq_Info Hey what mass are you getting?
Acc_Info i think we have excellent quality right now
Monitoring_Obj How appreciable is the change in mass if you prioritize FOS?
Prov_Info i don't know the lowest fos on my screen is 0.57
Underst_Dep what seems to be the ideal piston bore diameter on your end? Could you explain how it affects mass and FOS?
Prov_Info that is what I uploaded to me more consistent. My values did not change though
Acc_Info Awesome! I don't know how we did that, but I am happy.
Enq_Info is the FOS highest and mass lowest when the offset is 150?
Explore_Param I guess what I'm saying is if you can marginally increase mass to increasing FOS more noticeably, that might be a better compromise
Monitoring_Obj 45 seems decent, lower if we need to reduce mass
Prov_Info we have excellent quality right now
Enq_Info what are your current values?
Prov_Info My mass varies between 0-0.12 so let me know if you need me to adjust anything
Prov_Info i don't think so
Prov_Info I mean, I'm the low FOS of 2.01 now and can't really cut any more mass
Prov_Info I chose the smallest values to give smallest weight on my end
Enq_Info like parameters you chose
Prov_Info It increases pretty fast
Prov_Info Thats my max
Prov_Info Range of weights was 1.49 to 4.81. My broadcast uses 1.49 with FOS = 4.55
Enq_Info fos?
Prov_Info just updated to tf = 10, ds = 15 and shaved .03kg at limited cost
Prov_Info Ive maxed fos and my mass is at 0.12
Prov_Info overall FOS is 1.7
Prov_Info I dropped my mass by 0.02
Prov_Info I'm leaving it as 45 at least for now
Enq_Info does it help you if I reduce that value at all?
Request_Help Who has the FOS of .57? we need to work on increasing that
Prov_Info It increases mass by 0.03 and increases FOS to 5625.56
Enq_Info Parameters you chose
Prov_Info alright. fos increases with df, so rn i have it minimized, but can increase if needed.
Acc_Info Sounds good thank you!
Prov_Info Not much it doesn't really do anything to the factor of safety but it brings the mass down
Sugg_Info i think you have the biggest weight contribution, so if you can optimize a bit we should be close
Prov_Info Yes, I just posted an updated broadcast
Sugg_Info whoever changed please go back
Enq_Info what's your fos?
Prov_Info It affects the design variable "c", which the length of the bearing support offset
Prov_Info mine is mass of 6.33 and fos of 2.23
Monitoring_Obj Increasing the value of c presents two adverse cases where mass increases and FOS decreases so I'm tending towards c = 60
Enq_Info Whats it at with 45?
Prov_Info Hi flywheel! My crankshaft depends on your flywheel shaft diameter(d_s) and thickness of flywheel(t_f). I don't yet know how, but it will probably help that you know!
Underst_Dep How does the flywheel thickness factor into the bearing support offset and crankshaft mass?
Prov_Info My mass is lowered and my fos is just above 2
Prov_Info Just updated for D = 40, Im getting fos of 3.44
Enq_Info Does increasing the flywheel thickness increase or decrease "c"?
Explore_Param If it's important, increasing "tf" increases mass but decreases FOS
Acc_Info cool
Prov_Info I don't change that. I only change c and d_c
Prov_Info My mass is ~30 lbs, but the crankshaft mass is always high. I can set it over 50 by myslef...
Sugg_Info Ok. Do that! That's a big FOS for only a gain of 0.03
Prov_Info 7.96 has been the best achieved thus far
Sugg_Info whoever changed please go back
Enq_Info looks like we're done?
Prov_Info i have not
Prov_Info Lower D, lowers my mass and FOS
Enq_Info Do you need me to adjust anything to make yours work?
Prov_Info just updated my broadcast
Prov_Info Increasing the offset increases the mass and decreases the factor of safety.
Monitoring_Obj that's a pretty high mass, any chamce you can bring it down and keep FOS just over 2?
Underst_Dep My design depends on the piston diameter, what happens if you decrease it? 
Enq_Info What mass are you at?
Prov_Info I'm working really close the the flywheel engineer
Acc_Info i can try
Explore_Param yeah, the overall mass went up, so I'm about to raise my mass and drop the fos one of the other designers asked me to 
Prov_Info yes i believe
Prov_Info Right now our factor of safety is chilling around 2.5
Acc_Info Awesome! I don't know how we did that, but I am happy.
Prov_Info most recent fos is 3.01
Underst_Dep Ok, and we want to increase FOS and decrease mass
Prov_Info the current broadcast. FOS = 5626
Prov_Info thickness is tf = 10
Acc_Info cool same. one of these parts is thiccc
Prov_Info I chose the smallest values to give smallest weight on my end
Enq_Info Hello.  Have you determined what you would like the piston bore diameter (D) to be?
Prov_Info Mine is at 1.59 for my most recent broadcast
Enq_Info Our design changed to good. Do you know what changed?
Enq_Info Our quality is back down to good. What changed?
Explore_Param But if i increase the thickness i could make it a lot higher
Prov_Info I haven't changed my upload since I started. My fos is 3.96 right now
Explore_Param What does changing that do?
Prov_Info they're going to leave it safe, sinc eit doesn'taffect weight much
Underst_Dep What all affects the piston diameter? Keeping the diameter smaller improves both the pin's mass and factor of safety. What factors drive up the diameter?
Enq_Info who's fos changed?
Prov_Info which is the best we can do
Prov_Info Right now it says we have an excellent design
Prov_Info for tf = 10 & ds = 25; m = 0.55 and FOS = 5625.56
Acc_Info it should be, no?
Request_Help Unsure relationship for increasing ds? thoughts?
